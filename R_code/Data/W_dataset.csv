Gemma Bonner rejoins Liverpool – decades after asking Santa for their kit,The Guardian,Guardian sport,2022-12-24,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/24/gemma-bonner-rejoins-liverpool-women-racing-louisville-asked-santa-for-kit,"Liverpool Women have re-signed the defender Gemma Bonner, who captained the club to two Women’s Super League titles. The 31-year-old joins from Racing Louisville and will link up again with the manager Matt Beard.Bonner won the WSL in 2013 and 2014 under Beard during a six-year spell that ended in 2018 when she joined Manchester City. A childhood Liverpool fan, she wrote to Santa aged four or five asking for “a computer and a football Liverpool kit and four computer games”.On Saturday she said: “Growing up as a Liverpool fan it probably means that little bit more. Seeing my shirt today with the name on the back again was almost a little emotional.”Bonner, who has 11 England caps, signed for the US club Louisville from City on a two-year deal in April 2021. The centre-back has made the second-highest number of appearances for Liverpool Women in the professional era: 115.“It’s a pretty special moment for me,” she said of returning. “I still pinch myself when I’m coming into Anfield. I’m super-excited to be back and I can’t wait to pull the shirt on again … I think I always knew within myself that one day I would love to come back to Liverpool. Now the time feels right.”Beard took over as Liverpool’s manager for the second time in May 2021 and won the Women’s Championship last season. The team are ninth in the WSL.“It was too good an opportunity to pass up to bring Gemma back to the football club,” Beard said. “We had a great working relationship before and she will bring leadership and experience to the team … It just feels like she’s coming home.”","['a computer and a football Liverpool kit and four computer games', 'Growing up as a Liverpool fan it probably means that little bit more.

Top women footballers are being pushed past breaking point – enough is enough | Suzanne Wrack,The Guardian,Suzanne Wrack,2022-12-22,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/22/top-women-footballers-are-being-pushed-past-breaking-point-enough-is-enough,"Beth Mead is among a host of players sidelined with ACL injuries, yet Fifa’s response is to add to a packed scheduleThe photograph of Beth Mead and her partner and Arsenal teammate, Vivianne Miedema, on the red carpet before the England forward’s BBC Sports Personality of the Year win, illustrated a problem rocking women’s football. Both were standing there, two of the best female players on the planet, on crutches. Mead ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her knee in November, before Miedema, the Women’s Super League record goalscorer, did the same this month. Both will probably miss the Women’s World Cup next year in Australia and New Zealand.Their situation is not unique. In the past year a whole host of players have missed significant portions of the season with ACL injuries. Those at the top as well as further down the pyramid have been affected.The double Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas was cruelly ruled out with an ACL injury on the eve of Euro 2022, with Spain the bookies’ favourites to win. France’s Marie-Antoinette Katoto ruptured her ACL during the tournament. Chloe Kelly, Dzsenifer Marozsan, Kyah Simon, Ellie Brazil, Ellie Carpenter, Jessica Ziu, Chantelle Boye-Hlorkah, Simone Magill, Ada Hegerberg, Christen Press and Catarina Macario have all been sidelined by the knee ligament injury in the last year. Research suggests it as injury that women are four to eight times more likely to suffer from than men.There have long been calls for more research to be done on the increased occurrence of ACL injuries in female footballers. This is far from a new issue. There is probably not one answer to the problem, either, with loading, biomechanics, hormonal changes, training opportunities, footwear and pitch quality all potentially having on impact on the increased likelihood of female players suffering ACL injuries.In 2020 the Guardian reported on the four possible neuromuscular imbalances that were being investigated by researchers at the University of Roehampton in London. Some research is being done into the increased likelihood of an ACL injury being suffered by female football players and the preventive measures that can be taken, but it is not enough and it is not being taken sufficiently seriously or tackled quickly enough by the footballing authorities.How quickly would clubs and the governing bodies of the game get to the heart of an injury problem if it was Kylian Mbappé, Lionel Messi and Kevin De Bruyne affected by the same injury within months of each other? Can you imagine if any of those players had suffered the same injury three times in their career, like the two-time World Cup winner Megan Rapinoe has?We would have state-of-the-art research, technology and money pouring in to solve the problem or limit it. There would be a drive to protect the players – not, ultimately, because they deserve protection as people, but because they are assets of huge value commercially.Instead of announcements of mass investment into research around the prevalence of ACL injuries in the women’s game, we have been promised additions to a calendar that is pushing players at the top end of the sport past breaking point.The day after Miedema left the pitch in tears, Fifa revealed plans for the introduction of a women’s Club World Cup and an extension of the current international women’s match calendar to 2025, meaning that the current number of international windows – which is widely viewed to be too many – will remain for two years beyond the current calendar.A Club World Cup is not a bad idea – in fact, it would be a welcome addition – but there needs to be a more holistic and player-centred focus to planning women’s football.Sign up to Moving the GoalpostsInformative, passionate, entertaining. Sign up to our weekly round-up of women’s football now.Players at the top end who play internationally are in the middle of five years of back-to-back tournaments in June-August without a break. That is hugely problematic. Meanwhile, teams outside Europe struggle for regular fixtures that match the competitive level offered by the Euros and the Women’s Champions League. There is a duality to the problem: some players are playing too much football and some too little, and both scenarios likely affect the chance of injury.It is the same domestically, with teams competing in tournaments such as the Champions League stretched while those without international competition or long cup runs domestically struggle to keep their players physically ready.One part solution to the problem at the top end could be to make the women’s Olympic competition mirror that of the men’s with under-23 teams competing (plus up to three senior players). However, that helps European teams but may hamper the likes of the USA, Canada, Brazil and Japan, who rely on the Olympics to offer a top-level competitive test between World Cups.The recent rejection of the suggestion from a number of international managers to have squad sizes increased from 23 players to 26 players for the World Cup only adds to the impression that little is being done to lift the burden.Now is the time to think differently, to put players at the centre of the future of the women’s game, as well as the men’s. Where is the authenticity and authority of a World Cup if a large number of the world’s best players are missing from it? If the health and welfare of players isn’t enough to prompt serious action, then perhaps the fact it is starting to undermine the product Fifa is trying to sell will do the job.",[],
Jonathan Morgan: ‘Burnley brought me in on my merits rather than perception and biases’,The Guardian,Suzanne Wrack,2022-12-15,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/15/burnley-women-jonathan-morgan-interview,"Manager explains exit from Leicester, finding joy at Burnley and the lack of support for managers from ethnic minoritiesThings are going well for Jonathan Morgan. His team, Burnley Women, are the only unbeaten side in the third and fourth tiers of women’s football in the UK, having gone 16 games without losing since the start of the season.It is also a strange time for Morgan, who spent seven years at Leicester, taking the women’s team from the fourth tier to the Super League before being dismissed in November 2021. The sacking forced him to pause and consider his options, but also reflect on what had happened. It is fair to say he feels happy and appreciated at Burnley whereas that wasn’t always the case at Leicester.He describes a few everyday scenarios that, he feels, are the difference between the clubs and how they integrate the women’s team. “Myself and the striker Courtney Willis were doing a one-to-one analysis session in the men’s first team analysis room and the men’s assistant coach, Craig Bellamy, walked in. You just think: ‘Oh shoot, I gotta get out.’“You automatically think there’s a hierarchy, but he’s just: ‘How long are you going to be mate? Don’t leave on my account, if you’re going to be another half an hour I’ll just go and get another room.’ Then, he sat there and went through a couple of clips with me and Courtney. It was just class.“Another time I was printing up some kit and the men’s manager, Vincent Kompany, was in the kit room with me, just sat there chatting while I was doing it. It’s these little moments that show you a club that’s really truly together. I never ever had that feeling at Leicester and I don’t think many clubs genuinely have that feeling.”What made the exit from Leicester harder was that so many of his family were or had been part of the side’s rise. His sister Holly was captain and their father, Rohan, used to be the chairman. Jonathan’s other sister Jade is, as general manager, the only remaining Morgan at the club.The fear for Leicester was perhaps the nepotistic image the Morgan involvement gave, but as a family the Morgans invested heavily in the building of the club from the bottom up, both financially and time-wise. Morgan and his father’s business financed Leicester all the way up to the Championship-winning season.“We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of pounds over those years. If you look around now you see a wealth of players that came through our club and are doing well in other clubs in the Midlands. We’ve probably held up the Midlands from a player pathway point of view. We were just a family club,” says Morgan.“When I first started we had nothing, it was nothing. I always heard what people thought: ‘He got there because his dad took over’, that type of thing.“It is true, my dad gave me the opportunity originally. But he didn’t do the coaching, he didn’t do the tactics, he didn’t go through badges and get the licences. So that hurt.“Holly as a player got it, too: ‘She’s only captain because of her brother.’ No one really took into consideration how that affected us. We just had to smile and put on a strong face because that was just the position we were in.”After all the success, things changed, Morgan feels, when Leicester took full control of the women’s team in 2020, just after they had won promotion to the Super League. Morgan was sacked after eight winless games at the start of the 2021-22 season and he has the feeling that his family’s presence was “a ticking timebomb from the moment that Leicester took over”.Being forced out was hard. “It was a horrible time,” he says. “We’re all clever enough to know when you’re wanted somewhere and when you’re not wanted. Even during the Championship season, it was very, very difficult. Without going into too much detail, we had little targets set for our first year in the WSL that were really unattainable. You start wondering why they are setting unattainable targets and you start wondering why you are not getting the players you want and why no one is fighting your corner.”Sign up to Moving the GoalpostsInformative, passionate, entertaining. Sign up to our weekly round-up of women’s football now.That meant when the sacking came “it wasn’t as hard as it maybe would be otherwise”. Morgan wasn’t sure whether he wanted to go back into football. He has a masters in quantity surveying and still runs his housing business, so in a way doesn’t need football but says he was disappointed at the lack of support from the FA and lack of interest from other clubs after his dismissal, particularly as one of the few black managers in the women’s game.“A lot of [the talk about support for black and ethnic minority managers] is lip service,” he says. “I don’t really talk too much about it because it’s such a polarising topic and people just either support you or they just go straight against you when you talk about it. All I can say is that I don’t think in any way, shape or form over the years I’ve had any real support from any of the governing bodies.“It feels very, very easy to move on a manager from an ethnic minority or of colour and you don’t really see them come back in straight away. I barely get approached, if ever. Burnley was probably the first club to properly approach me and say: ‘We want you.’ I don’t think there’s enough support out there.”Morgan has stepped out of the family shadow and he feels it is a refreshing change. “One of the things I love about Burnley is that they brought me in on my merits, rather than what people said or what people think about me,” he says. “Hopefully, so far, they’ve seen the success in that, we’re the only team in the league that hasn’t lost yet.”His time at Burnley has helped relight the fire. “One thing I needed to find out was whether I loved being in football because I was with Jade, Holly and my dad. Was that my pull? Was that my reason? It really was a strong one. Everything I did, I always had to think about the effect on them too.“At Burnley I can be more focused on myself and the team and not the wider impact my decisions could have. It’s nice to be able to be Jonathan rather than the Morgan family or the Morgan dynasty.”","['Myself and the striker Courtney Willis were doing a one-to-one analysis session in the men’s first team analysis room and the men’s assistant coach, Craig Bellamy, walked in.

            Everton host Durham on Saturday December 17 in the League Cup at 12.30pm. Reading are next up for Everton in the WSL on January 15, kick-off 3pm.Arsenal's Jen Beattie and Everton's Izzy Christiansen discuss the difficult balance between friendship and rivalry in women's football with former Lioness Rachel Yankey on Three Players and a Podcast.The setting for the recent WSL game between Manchester United and Aston Villa was Old Trafford and saw players from both teams socialising ahead of the game at the famous ground.The new Sky Sports podcast - in which three women's football stars talk discuss three hot topics - started with the question 'is there rivalry in the women's game?'""I think the game has evolved,"" said Everton midfielder Christiansen. ""I feel like there's that mutual professional respect across friends across the league that players probably don't talk prior to the game but just always catch up after.""Top football executives are to kick off a fresh search for external funding for the Women's Super League (WSL) amid soaring domestic and international interest in the sport.Sky News has learned that the WSL board is close to re-engaging bankers at Rothschild to canvas investor interest in the league's commercial rights.Sources said the WSL could potentially seek as much as £100m in outside financing to fund the development of the competition and the broader women's game.Rothschild's reappointment - more than 18 months after it was asked by the WSL and Football Association to explore funding options for the league - comes as attendances at WSL matches reach unprecedented heights.With Chelsea leading the way as the league halts for its mid-season winter break, Sky Sports reporter Anton Toloui assesses which Women's Super League clubs are genuine title challengers.Make yourself a millionaire with Super 6.

Chelsea survive scare to move clear at top of WSL,BBC News,,2022-12-11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63849450,"Last updated on 11 December 202211 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballChelsea ensured they will spend the winter break three points clear at the Women's Super League summit by holding off Reading at a snowy Kingsmeadow.Fran Kirby's early finish set the tone as the hosts dominated the first half, with Jelena Cankovic scoring twice.Cankovic stroked in after Johanna Rytting Kaneryd struck a post and headed in a cross four minutes later.But Reading then struck twice in two second-half minutes, through Sanne Troelsgaard and Amalie Eikeland.Troelsgaard's low shot squirmed under Ann-Katrin Berger following some uncertain defending before Eikeland fired in off a post as their side threatened to end Chelsea's eight-match winning league run.Chelsea manager Emma Hayes defended Berger but said her side had let their standards slip after surging into a commanding lead.""I'm not going to target individuals,"" said Hayes. ""As a team, I felt we were complacent and Ann has been a top goalkeeper for a long time.""While she will have wanted to do better, we did not do well enough as a team in the second half.""The reigning champions had seen Arsenal draw level with them at the top of the table by beating Aston Villa earlier on Sunday.Reading were aggrieved by Kirby's opener, as provider Kaneryd appeared to be offside when she collected the ball.The third-bottom Royals remain seven points clear of trouble after an 11th away game without victory.Reading head coach Phil Cousins was booked for protesting - with some justification - about Kirby's goal being permitted, although it is unlikely Chelsea's spirited opponents would have held them at bay for much longer even if it had been ruled out.Despite the testing conditions, Reading's determination to press paid off when Millie Bright failed to deal convincingly with a cross and Berger allowed Troelsgaard's low shot to roll under her.The team who had been beaten 5-0 on their previous two trips to Chelsea could not complete what would have been a remarkable comeback to claim an unlikely point.Captain Emma Harries said the strugglers were ""gutted"" to have lost. ""People didn't even expect us to come here and contend with the likes of Chelsea but it shows that we can compete with the best teams,"" she added.On this form, though, Reading can look forward to their return to WSL action in January - and Chelsea's challengers for the title will have watched on encouraged as the leaders laboured to victory.Chelsea goalscorer Kirby - born in Reading, and a graduate of their youth system - has rarely shown mercy to her hometown club, playing a direct role in 11 goals in eight appearances against them.The England livewire averaged comfortably more than a goal a game during her three years as a first-teamer with the Royals, and her eighth against them relied on a piece of quick thinking from a free-kick and a failure from the officials to spot an apparent clear offside.The early first goal was reward for a crowd of 1,184 who sang Always Look on the Bright Side of Life during the early stages as they braved freezing conditions to watch the final game of the calendar year at Kingsmeadow.Formation  3-4-1-2Formation  4-1-3-2Match ends, Chelsea Women 3, Reading Women 2.Second Half ends, Chelsea Women 3, Reading Women 2.Corner,  Chelsea Women.

West Ham secure derby win at Tottenham in WSL,BBC News,,2022-12-11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63849444,"Last updated on 11 December 202211 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballDagny Brynjarsdottir and Hawa Cissoko scored second-half goals as West Ham secured a London derby win at Tottenham in the Women's Super League.Having missed a first-half penalty, Brynjarsdottir collected a loose ball and fired the visitors in front after 49 minutes.Cissoko struck on a late counter attack for the Hammers, who look set to end the calendar year fifth in the WSL.Defeat was Spurs' third in a row as they stayed seventh.The Hammers went three points ahead of Aston Villa, in sixth, who lost 4-1 to Arsenal on Sunday.Victory means West Ham have now won three of their past four matches, bouncing back from last weekend's loss to out-of-form Liverpool.They were the better side at the Breyer Group Stadium in Leyton and were awarded a penalty when Spurs defender Kerys Harrop took out Kate Longhurst on the edge of the box on the stroke of half-time.Brynjarsdottir's spot-kick was poor, well wide of the target, although she would make amends with her goal shortly after the restart, her fifth in 10 WSL matches this season.Spurs piled on the pressure late on, only to leave space at the back for Hammers centre-half Cissoko to burst forward and chip the ball over onrushing goalkeeper Rebecca Spencer in the 83rd minute.It was to be the last meaningful piece of action as the defender marked her first start since returning from a five-match suspension with her first league goal for West Ham.The Hammers have never finished higher than seventh in their two WSL campaigns.But, after a fifth league win from 10 games, they remain set to make club history in manager Paul Konchesky's first season in charge.While Tottenham, who have now lost five of their eight WSL matches this term, are in mid-table, closer in points to bottom club Leicester than they are to the top three.Formation  3-4-3Formation  4-3-3Match ends, Tottenham Hotspur Women 0, West Ham United Women 2.Second Half ends, Tottenham Hotspur Women 0, West Ham United Women 2.Attempt missed.

Title-chasing Arsenal enjoy comeback win at Villa,BBC News,,2022-12-11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63849447,"Last updated on 11 December 202211 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballBoss Jonas Eidevall says Arsenal ""are in a great position"" in the Women's Super League after coming from behind to brush aside Aston Villa.Kirsty Hanson's 20-yard strike gave the hosts a shock early lead but Rachel Corsie's own goal drew Arsenal level.Vivianne Miedema, Katie McCabe and Jordan Nobbs struck to take Arsenal above Manchester United into second.""It's important we are professional and get the job done - the team maturity pleased me,"" Eidevall told Sky Sports.""It was very good to keep our patience and composure even if we conceded a goal at the beginning,"" he added.""It's five or six minutes into the game, we don't need to respond in any drastic way in that moment. ""It's about having belief in our gameplan and not changing or letting the emotions take over at that point. It was good to see we continued to create a lot of scoring opportunities. ""We have had three games in a row where we have only, by our high standards, scored one goal in each game. That's why I think it was important from a self-confidence perspective to put a few more of the opportunities away today.""Victory briefly took Arsenal level on points with leaders Chelsea but the Blues re-established a three-point cushion by beating Reading 3-2 later on Sunday.Eidevall's side still hold a game in hand over their London rivals - and the two sides meet in their first game of 2023 when Arsenal host Chelsea on 15 January.This win was an eighth successive away triumph in the WSL for Arsenal, who always looked in control after cancelling out the early deficit, even if sixth-placed Villa did provide spirited opposition throughout.""All in all, I think we're in a great position in the league and now we need to focus on the Champions League,"" added Eidevall, whose side face Lyon and Zurich in their final two group games before Christmas.At the final whistle at Villa Park, both Arsenal and Chelsea had identical records of eight wins and just one defeat from nine WSL matches this term.That suggests this season's title race will be just as tight as last year when Chelsea pipped the Gunners by just a point. Perhaps it will be even tighter this time, with the two Manchester clubs not far behind.Last season, Arsenal were left to rue a surprise defeat at relegated Birmingham City that was construed by many to have cost them the title - and they looked in danger of suffering more 'second city' misery after Hanson's sixth-minute opener.The on-loan Manchester United forward took Kenza Dali's pass in her stride before firing a fine finish across Manuela Zinsberger into the far corner from the left-hand edge of the penalty area.Arsenal continued to look nervy at the back as Laura Blindkilde Brown's mis-hit cross struck Zinsberger's crossbar, but the Gunners retained their own threat going forward.Hannah Hampton saved well from Miedema before Hanson's opener, while Caitlin Foord blazed off target when well placed and McCabe's 25-yard free-kick whistled inches over.There was a slice of fortune about Arsenal's 26th-minute equaliser as Hampton's attempt to palm out McCabe's cross struck Corsie and ricocheted in, despite Danielle Turner's effort to clear it off the line.Arsenal led four minutes later as the luckless Hampton punched a corner straight to Miedema, who volleyed home through a crowd of bodies.After finishes of ninth and 10th in their first two WSL seasons, Carla Ward's Villa are progressing despite a raft of injuries and had won four of their past five games in league and cup.After the break, Alisha Lehmann and Dali both tested Zinsberger, but Arsenal possessed the greater quality in the attacking third, evidenced by incisive moves for their third and fourth goals.Lia Walti sent Steph Catley away and her cross was parried for Hampton for McCabe to slot home before Foord's low ball was expertly swept home by substitute Nobbs with six minutes left.Both teams now have more than a month off before their next game and Villa boss Ward is grateful for the break.""Now is the right time - I think everybody needs it mentally and physically,"" she said.""I think this next three or four weeks is a chance to not only get players back but also to bring three or four more faces into the building.

How motivator Scheuer can make winners of Brighton,BBC News,,2023-01-11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64112842,"Last updated on 6 hours ago6 hours ago.From the section Women's FootballThe intensity and passion Jens Scheuer will bring to English football began in a village in south-west Germany.Scheuer's earliest full coaching job came in 2010 at Bahlinger SC, an amateur regional league team formed almost a century ago in an agricultural area with a population of little more than 4,000.It was the start of a career that has taken in record points hauls, a near-invincible title win and an eight-goal thriller with Chelsea in the Women's Champions League semi-finals.Now the first German manager in the WSL has his sights on transforming Brighton & Hove Albion.As a teenager, Scheuer had been a trainee at SC Freiburg under then youth coach Christian Streich, whose current 11-year reign as manager of the club's men's team is by far the longest in the Bundesliga.Scheuer never appeared for Freiburg and spent most of his playing days with Bahlinger, but he was inspired by meeting Streich again at a Christmas party years later.Streich was able to tell Scheuer exactly when he worked with him, his position and subsequent clubs - and Scheuer resolved to make such meticulousness a hallmark of his own.""Jens did everything at this club,"" Dennis Buhrer, the current Bahlinger manager who Scheuer signed as a player in 2011, told BBC Sport.""As well as being the coach, he brought the balls, did the video analysis, everything. At a small club in a small village, it's difficult. But for his development, it was very good.""Jens has a lot of ideas about football. Outside of training, he is always thinking about football.""He is a motivator because he wants to win every time. I learned from him that I want to win every training game and every match at the weekend.""We won the first game under him 11-1. Then we thought we were the best club in the division. A lot was expected of us - too much.""Authenticity is key for Scheuer. He admires the extroversion of Megan Rapinoe, Miroslav Klose's down-to-earth sense of fun and the increasing willingness of players to take a stand on issues such as homophobia.He has admitted that he discounted working in the women's game after seeing a farcical handball go unpunished during the 2011 World Cup, then felt ""immediately annoyed"" for being ""so negative"" when he watched Freiburg women play.Scheuer became a Frauen-Bundesliga manager for the first time when Freiburg appointed him in 2015, leading a team including Germany forward Lina Magull to third place - their highest ever finish - in 2017-18, as well as the DFB-Pokal cup final a year later.When Bayern Munich secured his services, Scheuer oversaw the end of Wolfsburg's four-year stranglehold on the title.Bayern had finished eight points behind Wolfsburg in Scheuer's first season in charge. By the end of his second, they held a 19-goal superiority over the vanquished champions, scoring 82 times and conceding nine while losing once in 22 matches.""He has a lot of self-confidence,"" said Buhrer, who remains close to Scheuer and chuckles at his friend's appetite for English lessons in recent years.""He will coach a lot. Sometimes he is very emotional. We had to work hard.""I expected his success because he is very professional and he does everything for football. That's why he is coming to Brighton.""It's a big chance for him to do everything, every day, every hour for football. It's exactly his thing.""Scheuer has learned to relax, says Buhrer. The 44-year-old enjoys mountain walks, being a self-confessed bad loser at tennis and occasional glasses of wine - although much of his recent spare time appears to have been focused on Brighton's status as the WSL's most porous side.The Seagulls made four signings in four days at the start of January, bringing in defenders Zoe Morse and Guro Bergsvand alongside midfielders Dejana Stefanovic and Brianna Visalli.Scheuer wants ""deep conversations"" and ""close connections"" with his players, who will be used to his high-intensity sessions by the time of a kind-looking first fixture for their new manager at bottom side Leicester on Sunday.He is also preoccupied by changing the culture of the club, so that dropping points against the likes of Chelsea and Arsenal would be considered a cause for profound dissatisfaction.Victory over Chelsea, Scheuer has said, is a priority - and he is only half-joking because of the painful memory of his last meeting with the WSL leaders.Bayern won the first leg of their Champions League semi-final against Emma Hayes' team in 2021, only falling behind for the first time in the tie in the 84th minute of the return game at Kingsmeadow.""I like talking with him about football,"" says Buhrer, pondering Scheuer's strategy. ""He wants to play good football first - not only long balls and kick-and-rush.""He'll want to watch and look at Brighton's situation. He can adapt.

Man City held by Man Utd in entertaining WSL derby,BBC News,,2022-12-11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63849445,"Last updated on 11 December 202211 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballManchester City played out a thrilling draw against neighbours and top-three rivals Manchester United at Etihad Stadium in front of the second-largest crowd in Women's Super League history.After a positive start from the hosts, their momentum took a knock when Leah Galton skipped past City defender Laia Aleixandri and played a one-two with Ella Toone before driving through the legs of Alex Greenwood in the 27th minute.City's first-half response was not encouraging for the subdued crowd of 44,259 - a record attendance for the hosts - and the opening exchanges of the second period did not make for better viewing.But Laura Coombs' header from Chloe Kelly's cross - which had evaded United defender Millie Turner, who was distracted by the presence of the WSL's top goal scorer Khadija Shaw - drew City level and sparked them and the home crowd into life.What ensued was an entertaining, end-to-end encounter, with both sides knowing a point - even though it was probably a fair result - would be no good to them if the title race and push for third-place goes down to the wire.City are fourth in the table, three points behind third-placed United after nine games. They trail leaders Chelsea by five points following the Blues' win over Reading on Sunday evening, but United have played one game fewer.The result means United have still never beaten their city rivals in the WSL. The hosts started the game well and for 20 minutes United struggled to deal with City's high press as the Blues limited their only chance to a Katie Zelem set-piece, smothered by goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck.But as the first half went on and the visitors managed to break through that press, City struggled to create any meaningful chances and momentary flashes of brilliance from Lauren Hemp, who did not see enough of the ball, were the only thing a subdued crowd could find to cheer about.City's frustrations came to a head when Leila Ouahabi's diving tackle cut out a superb driving run from Hannah Blundell and the former Barcelona defender screamed at her City team-mates, furious that Blundell had been able to make the run.The home side started the second half much the same and Coombs' headed goal came out of nowhere but it was the catalyst City needed to raise their game.Kelly sent in a dangerous ball that looked set for the back of the net before firing over the bar on the volley, while Hemp's low cross was skewed over the bar before it could reach the arriving Shaw.Earps twice denied the head of Shaw and the Jamaican striker almost had the chance to volley home after a scramble in the box as the crowd sensed something could be brewing.City manager Gareth Taylor paced his technical area, while United counterpart Marc Skinner opted for a more controlled position on the bench, as the crowd inside the Etihad willed the home side to find an elusive winner.After what started as a dispiriting City performance, Taylor will probably be disappointed his side could not wrap up the victory and firmly put his side among the title contenders.This is the third WSL match in a row that United have played inside the bigger men's stadium and the players seem to be thriving on the big occasion.After a tricky start, where United goalkeeper Earps brilliantly punched Greenwood's deep corner away from the mouth of the goal, Galton and Blundell's link-up play down the left flank paid off.Galton's smash was the first goal United have scored in a Manchester derby at City's ground in the WSL.After the equaliser, United looked fired up and Ella Toone fired over the bar before the game settled but into something more intense than the first half, with Russo going close with her head before Roebuck produced a sensational save from a Martha Thomas header.United had chances to steal the points in the dying seconds as Toone shot over the bar before a mistake from Roebuck afforded Lucia Garcia an opportunity which was superbly blocked by Greenwood.Formation  4-3-3Formation  4-2-3-1Match ends, Manchester City Women 1, Manchester United Women 1.Second Half ends, Manchester City Women 1, Manchester United Women 1.Attempt blocked.

Why do so many women footballers get ACL injuries?,BBC News,,2022-12-21,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64032536,"Last updated on 21 December 202221 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballNot another. When Arsenal striker Vivianne Miedema left the pitch on a stretcher last Thursday evening with her hands covering her face, onlookers were already fearing the worst.Four days later it was confirmed - another of the world's best female players had suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, regarded as one of the worst injuries to have as a footballer.The all-time top scorer in the Women's Super League joins an ever-expanding list which includes her partner and Arsenal team-mate Beth Mead, who was the Euro 2022 player of the tournament, and the winner of the Ballon d'Or, Alexia Putellas.Once again, there are renewed calls from players, fans and managers for more research into why this type of injury is more prevalent in female footballers than male. England striker Chloe Kelly has said the ""fear"" and ""negativity"" around ACL injuries ""needs changing"". So what is being done to try and reduce the risk?Research has long suggested that ACL injuries - the most serious kind of knee damage - are more prevalent in female footballers, with estimates ranging from two to eight times more likely than in male.Dr Katrine Okholm Kryger, a senior lecturer in sports medicine at St Mary's University in London who specialises in football, said recent discussions have focused on whether the injury risk is sex related - the female anatomy and hormones, or whether it could be gender related - the way female athletes are raised and managed compared to male athletes.""I think there's some truth in all of these areas,"" she said.""We have to be really careful when we talk about this in women's football because there is a tendency within research and within the media of being like 'oh, women are so unstable, fragile, because of their anatomy, their hormonal fluctuations' but we haven't proven that is the cause of these injuries.""Maybe it is the way we're treating women. I'd like to see that changed in people's perceptions of female athletes and women's football in general."" 1. Anatomy/biomechanicsThe physical differences between men and women, such as women generally having wider hips, which increase the leg's angle into the knee, and under-developed muscles which prevent the knee from turning in upon landing, have been the subject of research looking at whether that increases the risk.However, Dr Okholm Kryger says that there is no strong evidence from the research that this is the main risk factor.2. HormonesThe role of the menstrual cycle has also been put forward as potentially making females more predisposed to injury at certain times. During the menstrual cycle when oestrogen is elevated, which usually happens in the second week, it can affect the stability of joints, making them looser and more lax. However, Dr Okholm Kryger is keen to stress that there is a lack of research to support whether this increases the risk of injury. ""There has been some not very high quality research done on the relationship between the menstrual cycle and the ACL risk,"" she said. ""It's very difficult because you need either continuous blood samples or saliva.""Most of it is done predicting where in the phase women are, based on when their period starts, most studies haven't actually measured hormonal levels in the body. So it's all predictions. When you put all the data together it shows very little difference.""Dr Okholm Kryger also pointed out players often report that they are more likely to get injured when they are on their period at the start of their cycle, but actually the risk should be higher during ovulation.3. Gender disparities A 2021 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicineexternal-link suggested looking at the influence of gender - pointing at external factors such as access to training, sport science, facilities and rehabilitation. Female footballers are likely to have significantly lower training ages - the amount of time and exposure an athlete has had to structured, coached and progressive training - compared to their male counterparts.Other gender disparities highlighted by Dr Okholm Kryger include the pitches used in the WSL compared to the Premier League and the design of football kit such as boots. Women move and run in a different way to men and yet the length of studs on boots are designed around male movement and traction, she pointed out, which increases the risk of women getting their boot stuck in the surface and an injury being caused.  4. WorkloadAs women's football grows rapidly, the amount of games and the level of intensity is also growing quickly, which is leading to increasing concern among managers and players in the game.""Obviously you can do everything to put the players in the best condition possible but with the volume of games and the limited recovery time at the moment, it's difficult to do anything about it,"" said Dr Okholm Kryger. Northern Ireland striker Simone Magill had waited her whole career for 7 July, when her country made their debut at a major tournament at Euro 2022.But 79 minutes into her side's first game against Norway, the dream was cut short.""I went to stick my leg out to balance, and as soon as I stuck my leg out, I literally felt the ligament pull away from my leg so I knew straight away it wasn't great. ""It was horrendous. I was a mess.""Magill, 28, was helped by being surrounded by eight international team-mates who had gone through it before her.""They were brilliant in terms of reassuring me. They were all examples to me that they had had it, gone through it and come back.""I had no idea the things you have to go through. I heard about so many people doing [their ACL] but I didn't actually know what that involved.""What makes the injury so difficult is the longevity, she said, as well as having to learn the mechanics of walking again. ""I completely forgot the natural way you would walk. I was having to learn that in the house, standing in front of a mirror and just focus on doing knee to toe, I had no idea that would happen!""I just assumed I would get surgery, be sore for a week or two, and then it would all come back to me.""It was the mental side of all that. I kept thinking, it's not my knee, it doesn't feel like my knee. Will it ever feel like my knee again?""Magill's ACL injury wasn't even the first of the European Championship, with Spain star Putellas having been ruled out on the eve of the tournament, while France's Marie-Antoinette Katoto would later become the third player to suffer it.""Now I've started to reflect on it, I definitely think that there's underlying reasons why it happened,"" said Magill. ""It's not just 'oh it's part and parcel of the game and we have to accept it'.""The rate it's happening at the minute it's actually frightening.""Dr Kryger works closely with a number of WSL teams, as well as the England team, and she said clubs know ACL injuries are ""the biggest problem in women's football at the moment because of the recovery time and the potential long-term impact on a player's career"".But while they are desperate to see improvements, knowing how to tackle it is more difficult.BBC Sport has been told one WSL club has recently recruited professionals to further research on ACLs as the game is still growing and adapting to increased professionalism.Dr Andrew Greene, a senior lecturer in biomechanics at the University of Roehampton, is a keen advocate of trying to implement injury prevention programmes at women's football clubs. Before he also became head of performance at women's Championship club Crystal Palace, he contacted every Championship club and some WSL sides about implementing a neuromuscular programme, aimed at targeting weaknesses in athletes.He said: ""What they are designed to do is address the underlying mechanical issues that we know contribute to the injury, and are the factors that we know are present in female athletes.""He gave an example of the hamstrings which he said tend to be an under-activated muscle group in female athletes.Palace engaged with the idea because two of their players had suffered ACL injuries in the previous year.Dr Greene said: ""If we can go back a step and make sure the athletes are more prepared for the intensity of a game and they are used to stopping, starting and changing direction in a controlled environment, those underlying capabilities are there and will assist in stabilising the joints and reduce the risk.""In the female game, while the facility of gym and conditioning programmes is getting far better, I still think in the Championship, the access to the gym is quite limited for the players. Reliance on a once a week gym programme is not sufficient.""The Football Association (FA) has conducted a study into the prevalence of ACL injuries in women's football in the WSL and the Championship over the past four seasons. Its results, which are due to be released in full in the new year, have shown that there were 0.1 injuries per 1,000 hours - 0.4 ACL per 1,000 match hours and 0.04 ACL injuries per 1,000 training hours - representing 1.3% of the total number of injuries. Hamstring injuries were the most common at 11%.The FA, which does not have the equivalent data for men's football, said in a statement: ""The overall injury rates across these leagues have decreased in the past four seasons, however we will continue with our injury and illness surveillance work, which will continue to give us important medical insight into women's football.""Research, research, research.Speaking to players, managers and academics, they all agree that there has not been enough research into the causes of ACL injuries.Tottenham manager Rehanne Skinner, speaking earlier this season after seeing two of her players suffer the injury, said: ""Clearly the demands of the game are changing and we need to understand what that involves. ""I still don't think there's enough research available for us to formulate collectively in the women's game the best possible plan moving forward.""Dr Okholm Kryger wants more large-scale research. She said: ""A lot of the data that comes out is from one club. ACLs happen too often but luckily you don't have many of them in a season. So if you only have data for one club or national team, it's only very limited amount of data that you're going to get.""She is currently in talks about setting up more research and is hopeful of getting the funding needed. One doctor, who formerly worked at a WSL club and didn't wish to be named, said he wanted to see the whole football community pushing for equity of access to resources for female players - whether that's coaching, sport sciences or access to facilities, starting at academy level.""The challenge, for the women's game across the board, is to get that kind of support that men get,"" he said. ""What you have in the women's game is that support staff aren't paid particularly well, so that means you're not maybe attracting the best. ""And the resources - at the highest level of the women's game, it wouldn't have a fraction of the number of staff that a very average men's team or very average men's academy would have.""Catch the gripping three-part drama Granite Harbour on BBC iPlayerA raw documentary considering the emotional and psychological impacts of manipulated video clipsLouis Theroux sits down with the popstar for a revealing interview...

Paul Konchesky: How West Ham fan became women's manager,BBC News,,2022-12-22,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63943618,"Last updated on 22 December 202222 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballPaul Konchesky used to stand on the North Bank at Upton Park with his mum to watch West Ham as a child - now he manages the women's team.He was a men's season-ticket holder and went home and away - when he could persuade his mum - and he dreamed one day of wearing the shirt as a player.That came true in 2005 when Konchesky signed for the club and went on to make 59 appearances at full-back.Now, 15 years after leaving West Ham as a player, he has ambitions to take the club up the Women's Super League table.Konchesky, 41, has always had a strong female presence in football with support from his mum.While he was gaining coaching experience at West Ham's boys' academy, Konchesky would often watch the women's team train.He eventually moved across to the WSL side in 2021, working as assistant manager alongside former boss Olli Harder.""My mum has been a big part of my career. She's a massive football fan so it obviously means a lot to me,"" Konchesky told BBC Sport.""When I came back here to work at the academy, the women's team were always around us. It had always been nice to watch them play and train but to be a part of it with Olli [Harder] was great - and I have never looked back.""Konchesky's pride at managing a team in West Ham colours is clear. He was born in east London, down the road from where the women's team play their home matches at Dagenham & Redbridge's Chigwell Construction Stadium.""West Ham was my team growing up. I went every week to the games. I have good memories from those days - I used to love it,"" he added.""Those memories change when you grow up and you start playing. I still supported West Ham and wanted them to do well, but when you play against them it's quite tough. ""When I came back here in 2005 it meant everything to me. I played in the FA Cup final for my beloved club in 2006. ""Life goes on after that, and now I've come back to manage the women's team and that's a massive part of me. I want to do well myself and for the football club.""Konchesky said the ability of the players has ""gone up massively"" from when he first became involved in the WSL more than a year ago.He is still learning about the league in his role as manager, but the players are getting used to his style.""I like to manage the women how I would have liked to have been managed when I was a player,"" said Konchesky. ""I took a lot from former managers of mine who were really good and tried to put that into me and how I wanted to lead this team. ""If I need to be more upbeat or put more pressure on them so they know I'm not messing around then they know that. When I step in, the girls listen and want to learn from me.""I think I get a lot of that respect from playing and my career speaks for itself. For them to respect me is nice, but I have to respect them too, and I do - a lot. I think what they need, I can help them with.""West Ham were successful under former boss Harder, finishing sixth in the WSL with their highest points tally in 2021-22 before the New Zealand coach stepped down in May.They have continued their upward trajectory with Konchesky, sitting fifth with five wins from their opening 10 matches this season. And Konchesky believes his side have shown they can compete on the pitch against what are widely regarded as the top four clubs - Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United.""I've learned that the gap at the top is maybe not as big as people think it is. The players are fitter, stronger, and there are some clever footballers in the WSL,"" said Konchesky. ""The aim is to try and bridge the gap. We know there's a top three or four. When I say the gap is getting closer, I mean in games generally. We are staying in games with the bigger clubs.""Asked how he would describe the style of his side, Konchesky said they play ""on the front foot"" and show determination. ""We have made our home like a fortress. It's hard for teams to come to our place and win. Even when we go away, we know we can compete,"" he added. ""The enthusiasm and desire to win games - rather than sit back - is what my team has shown.""So what does the man from east London want to achieve with West Ham?""Every year we want to get better,"" he said.

WSL Preview: Aston Villa Women v Arsenal,Arsenal.com,,2022-12-10,https://www.arsenal.com/news/wsl-preview-aston-villa-women-v-arsenal,"This menu is keyboard accessible. To open a menu item's submenu, press the space bar. To close a submenu press the escape key.Our Gunners will be looking to bag our eighth win of the Women's Super League season as we travel to Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon. Boosted by our 1-0 victory over Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday evening, an in-form Vivianne Miedema joins a squad bouncing back from injuries on the journey to Villa Park. All the action kicks off at 4.15pm (UK time) and is available to watch live on Sky Sports. 






Currently sitting in fifth place in the WSL table, Carla Ward's side have made a considerable improvement to last season's form. Villa have already won two of their four home matches in the WSL this season, which is more victories than they managed at home for the entirety of the previous campaign (W1 D2 L8).Their opening day victory over Manchester City was followed by a win over struggling Leicester City and they have yet to record a draw in the league. More recently, however, the Villans lost 5-0 to Manchester United in front of an impressive crowd at Old Trafford.

Women: Aston Villa (h) - Highlights


Women: Aston Villa (h) - HighlightsThe last time we met Villa, we put seven past them at Meadow Park in May 2022. A brace from Vivianne Miedema, alongside goals from Beth Mead, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Stina Blackstenius, and Nikita Paris made it for one to forget for the Villans. We ran out 4-0 winners last time around at Villa Park, with Kim Little, Mana Iwabuchi, and Katie McCabe all on the scoresheet. Our captain scored her 150th and 151st club goals and McCabe memorably beat Hannah Hampton from 40 yards out to secure a win.






Rachel Daly made her return to the Women's Super League in style, bagging two goals against Manchester City on her debut for Aston Villa. With eight goals so far this season, Daly is tied for top scorer with City's Bunny Shaw.She has scored each of Villa’s last five goals in the league, with those strikes spread across their last four games.






Leah Williamson and Rafaelle Souza remain fit and both made appearances in our last game against Juventus.Lina Hurtig returned to full team training this week after an injury sustained against Leicester, but Eidevall did not suggest that the Swedish winger would be in the matchday squad at the weekend: ""Lina and Kim are progressing, but I think the Villa game will come a little too early for both.""






Eidevall on Villa: ""I think they were progressing [during] the whole spring. We played very well in that game when we won at home at Boreham Wood in the spring but, before that game, they were a really strong team and were really close to getting points at Chelsea. It went to the last minutes of that game before it was decided.""We have massive respect for Aston Villa. We see them as one of the teams developing most in the league and Carla Ward is doing a tremendous job there. We know that they will be motivated, they will be ready for Sunday and we need to match that.""

Emma Mukandi: 'Reading did not support me as a mother',Telegraph.co.uk,Molly McElwee,2023-01-10,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/01/10/emma-mukandi-reading-did-not-support-mother/,"
The defender had no guarantee of maternity leave in her contract at the beginning of her pregnancy exposing a weakness in the system
Reading captain Emma Mukandi has accused the club of failing to support her as a new mother and criticised the maternity conditions available to Women's Super League players.Mukandi (nee Mitchell) gave birth to daughter Innes in November 2021, and has revealed for the first time the difficulties she has encountered as a WSL player.Speaking on Off the Ball's COYGIG Podcast, Scotland captain Mukandi said she faked an injury at the beginning of her pregnancy as no maternity conditions existed in her contract at the time, and described feeling ""left to the side"" by her club during those nine months and post-partum.""There was nothing in the contracts to say there was anything in place so I didn’t want to tell anybody in case it didn’t go down well,"" Mukandi, 30, said.“I know now if you tear your ACL for example and you play at Reading you’re going to be looked after, but I definitely think there’s not enough stuff in place to make women feel like they could actually do it [have a baby].”Mukandi took six months off after having her daughter, and played her first league match back for Reading at the beginning of this season. Since her return, she has encountered a range of issues with her club. As well as having to breast pump in a cupboard, Mukandi is banned from having her child onsite due to Reading's club policy - an issue she has taken up with the Professional Footballers' Association.“They basically said it was a club policy and that they didn’t have the right insurance to cover it but I just feel like that’s a bit of a cop out,"" Mukandi said of the policy. “For me, I was just a bit more disappointed because they never came and spoke to me. It was just this email that got put out. Which I felt was pretty directed at myself. I thought, if this is about me, why didn’t we have a conversation about it?”  Last February, the FA announced that a minimum standard maternity policy was to be mandated as part of club licenses for teams in the top two women's tiers for the very first time. Previously, Telegraph Sport revealed that no uniform policy existed for pregnant players or mothers in the WSL or second-tier Championship, leaving them at the behest of individual clubs who may not choose to provide any cover beyond statutory pay and leave.In the new agreement implemented at the start of the 2022-23 season, a player going on maternity leave will be paid 100 per cent of her weekly wage, as well as any other remuneration and benefits, for the first 14 weeks before reverting to the statutory rate.When approached regarding Mukandi's comments, an FA spokesperson said their new mandatory policy ""must be offered to players to ensure license criteria is met to participate in the leagues"".They added: ""It is at the discretion of clubs, who directly employ the players, if they choose to go above and beyond the regulations set out within our policy. We continue to work with clubs on all areas of player health and wellbeing, which is of paramount importance to us.""Though Mukandi's pregnancy and maternity leave happened prior to the FA's overhaul, Telegraph Sport understands that Reading honoured the same terms for her maternity period.But Mukandi said the 14-week policy does not go far enough and there remains a ""grey area"" which could leave players at smaller clubs with less support. “You only get 14 weeks full pay and you have to go back to work,"" Mukandi said. ""If I was to have a kid now, I don’t think I’d be able to return 14 weeks after giving birth. Bearing in mind that your body is your job.“So, who has even come up with that? Surely not someone who has played football and had a baby. Is that a man?“If a Sunday was to come ... and I couldn’t get childcare then I just can’t play that game.""They've put this policy out, and I feel like there's such a grey area. It comes down to whatever club you’re at. Like if you’re at an Arsenal or a Chelsea or a Man City and you’ve got loads of money, great facilities and that, having a baby there is not an issue at all but I think the lower down the league you go it’s easier for club CEOs to be like ‘No, this isn’t happening.’“I don’t think there is enough stuff in place to make women think ‘I could do it [have a baby.]""Reading declined to comment.We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions

To close a submenu press the escape key.We recovered emphatically from going behind early to make it three wins in eight days courtesy of a 4-1 success at Villa Park on Sunday - our 200th match in the Women's Super League.Jonas Eidevall praised Aston Villa heavily in the lead-up to our final Women’s Super League match of 2022 - and they struck first when Kirsty Hanson finished an early flowing move.We reacted well though and drew level just before the half hour through Rachel Corsie’s own goal, before Vivianne Miedema gave us the lead going into the break with a typically clinical close-range finish.Katie McCabe and second-half substitute Jordan Nobbs made sure of the win after the restart - taking us level on points with Chelsea at the top of the WSL ahead of the Blues’ meeting with Reading in the late kick-off.Despite an energetic opening from the hosts, we created the first chance of note. Lia Walti snapped into a tackle inside our half before feeding Miedema, who embarked on a fine solo run before stinging Hannah Hampton’s palms.We went close from the resulting corner, with Rafaelle nodding over after Hampton had misjudged the flight of the ball.Seconds later, though, we were behind. Impressive link play between Rachel Daly and Kenza Dali resulted in the latter freeing Hanson, whose powerful shot from the edge of the area found the far corner.We were straight back on the front foot after the early setback and almost went level when brilliant build-up play from Miedema created a chance for Caitlin Foord, who shot over.Both sides continued to threaten in an entertaining opening - McCabe’s 25-yard free-kick flew inches over at one end, Laura Blindkilde’s cross rattled our crossbar at the other.Having gone close to an equaliser, McCabe was instrumental in our equaliser. Our captain for the day was involved in neat interplay around the Villa box before seeing her low cross diverted just over the line following a double deflection, with Corsie getting the final touch.Soon after, we were in front. Hampton could only punch a corner out to Miedema, who volleyed home from eight yards.Stina Blackstenius went close with a header as we continued to look dangerous before the break.We didn't have to wait too long to extend our lead after half-time - McCabe firing home from close range after Steph Catley’s cross was touched into her path by Hampton.Carla Ward sent on Emily Gielnik as Villa searched for a route back into the game - but we continued to look the more threatening and almost extended our lead further when Blackstenius’ looping header from Williamson’s deep cross was hacked off the line.We added gloss to the scoreline late on - Foord driving towards goal before squaring to substitute Nobbs, who finished emphatically from close range to put the seal on a convincing display.The win saw us move level on points with Chelsea at the top of the WSL, ahead of Emma Hayes’ side’s match against Reading.Our next league match is against our title rivals, at Emirates Stadium on January 15 - but before then we have two Women’s Champions League matches, at home to Lyon on Thursday and away at FC Zurich on Wednesday, December 21.Arsenal: Zinsberger, Maritz (Wienroither 71), Wubben-Moy, Rafaelle (Williamson 60), Catley, Walti, Maanum, McCabe (c), Blackstenius, Foord (Iwabuchi 86), Miedema (Nobbs 72)Unused subs: Marckese, Beattie, AgyemangAston Villa: Hampton, Mayling, Corsie, Turner, Pacheco, McLoughlin (Gielnik 66), Blindkilde, Dali, Lehmann (Goodwin 86), Hanson, DalyUnused subs: Leat, KeitleyCopyright 2023 The Arsenal Football Club plc.

After an unprecedented year in 2022, Heather Knight, Natasha Jonas, Sarah Hunter, Jamie Chadwick, Nat Metcalf and Molly McCann consider what needs to happen next so women's sport can sustain momentum and keep breaking records
@VickicHodges
Wednesday 4 January 2023 08:17, UKIncreased visibility, greater financial backing and consistency are just three areas a group of leading female athletes are desperate to see implemented as women’s sport looks to take another giant leap forward in 2023.Following an unforgettable 2022 that witnessed the barnstorming success and ionic celebration delivered by the Lionesses and Chloe Kelly, the show-stopping historic spectacle of Savannah Marshall vs Claressa Shields at a sold-out O2 Arena and the edge-of-your-seat Rugby World Cup final where the Red Roses saw their 30-match unbeaten run ended in cruel fashion to New Zealand, how does women’s sport continue its climb this year?With the Football World Cup in Australia and New Zealand this summer, a T20 World Cup in South Africa this February followed by a home Ashes series later in June/July, a bumper Six Nations programme this spring that will see Twickenham play host to its first standalone England women’s fixture, a Netball World Cup in late July/August and the Solheim Cup in Spain this September, who needs to deliver or what needs to happen to shift the dial even further for women’s sport?“More financial support, with better facilities, better infrastructure for women’s sport more generally - and with that greater visibility.” That’s according to W Series champion Jamie Chadwick who witnessed first-hand the problems caused by a lack of investment, when the all-female single-seater racing championship was cancelled with three races to go in October due to a lack of funding.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player“While the Lionesses' success was highly-publicised, there's still a lot of women's sport that isn't covered and doesn't get the recognition it deserves. We need further coverage to inspire more and more people to start whatever it is and get more girls involved,” Chadwick, who will become the first woman in 13 years to compete full-time in Indy NXT, the chief support event to IndyCar series next season, continued.Britain’s unified world super-welterweight champion, Natasha Jonas, backs that sentiment: “I would like to see major investment from the grassroots up and have big commercial sponsorships for women on those big prime time slots still, and selling out shows.“I don’t think there’s a need to have female-only [boxing] shows but if that’s the case then let’s do it. Let’s all be behind it, like Sky was with the Claressa-Savannah card and let’s make the big fights happen and get the best people fighting the best.”Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerVisibility can help increase viewing and participation figures as well as allowing the audience to move away from classifying sport by gender. For UFC star Molly McCann, she believes it has been her generation of athletes who have made audiences think differently.“The visibility we’ve shown this year as female athletes, people have come to understand that it’s not men’s sport or women’s sport. People don’t say: ‘oh, the women’s MMA is on’, people say ‘UFC is on or Bellator is on’,” she said.“When it’s seen and it’s visible, it’s accessible and people buy into it because women do have to work harder just to be seen.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player“This generation before us were the ones who knocked on the door, while we’re the generation who broke the door down. It will be the next year and the year after that where the younger kids will be able to walk through the door.”England netball captain Nat Metcalf also wants to move away from defining sport by gender.“It’s an exciting time to be a female athlete in elite sport. I truly believe we are part of a movement,” she said. “I’d love to see a shift in the way it is talked about, for it to be just sport and not women’s sport.”Further visibility can lead to increased commercial revenue and inspire the next generation of athletes, according to Sarah Hunter, who became the most-capped England international and the most-capped women’s player in history when she made her 138th appearance for the Red Roses in their World Cup quarter-final against Australia.“I want to see continued visibility of women's sport to showcase how great and successful it is,” she said. “We have continually seen throughout 2022 that people want to watch women's sport. There's an appetite and demand for it. We need to keep shining a light on it. Being visible allows people to see and be inspired to become part of sport.“The more it’s seen, the more commercially viable women's sport becomes and more people want to invest in it, which means more can be put back into women's sport in all formats from grassroots all the way up to elite level. This will allow women's sport to take another giant leap.”A peak of 2.65 million UK viewers tuned in for the Rugby World Cup final on ITV despite its early kick-off at 6.30am, while a record global audience of more than 365m people watched this summer’s Euro 2022 with 50m tuning in for England’s victory over Germany in the final.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerLeah Williamson, who captained England on that memorable day at Wembley, believes the old adage of seeing it to be it is absolutely key, and has been throughout her career.""I was that girl growing up who had that picture of Kelly Smith on my wall, so I know the power of that,” she said. “I never had interactions with them. I didn't ask for a photo, but from watching from afar, it gave me that drive to be where I want to be.“If we can stand in a space that has always been for men, but only until recently did we really feel like we belonged, it's such a powerful message outside of football. In that public space, it's important that people see us and respect us for being successful women.”England cricket captain Heather Knight cited another factor important to the progression of women’s sport: consistency.“The progress has been amazing over the last few years, but there are still some bilateral tours where you don’t get as much coverage as you do for World Cups. So it’s important to keep women’s sport in the spotlight, keep people following it, and make it easy for people to access and watch and have that connection with the team.”Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerConnectivity was key to the Lionesses' historic Euros success this summer and evident in the overwhelming support for Jill Scott when she was crowned ‘Queen of The Jungle’ having made her first steps away from the football pitch in ITV’s ‘I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here’ in November.""There's a real momentum around women's sport at the moment, and it's great to be involved in,"" added Knight, who was at the forefront of one of the biggest sporting talking points this summer when she offered her verdict on Charlie Dean's 'Mankad' dismissal in the series against India which showed the appetite for healthy debate in sport regardless of it being men or women's sport.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player""We talk about it as a team about being successful and pushing women's sport forward in the UK and hopefully more of that will come,"" Knight, who made her international debut against India in 2010, said. ""Hopefully, we'll have success like the Lionesses to keep pushing it forward.“The success that teams are having is bringing on board sponsors and bringing more money into the game and accelerating the professionalism and standard of the game as well.”By driving standards, audiences increase, as witnessed by the 227 per cent surge in Women’s Super League attendances from this time a year ago.WSL clubs are now starting to stage more frequent fixtures in larger stadiums to accommodate the demand, and Chelsea and England defender Millie Bright believes this will become the norm in the near future.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player“It's exciting to play in the big stadiums and we're ready to go to that next level,” she said. ”It's time to make that jump and I know we'll get there eventually. Hopefully we'll be in a bigger stadium permanently, but you can see not just Chelsea, but all the clubs are playing in the bigger stadiums and we're getting the crowds in. The atmosphere is unbelievable and we really grow when we play in stadiums like that. You want to put on a show for everyone.”In just five years of being fully professional, the WSL has shown the benefits of what a full-time programme can do for women’s sport - and that has been despite the impact and delay caused by Covid. It is something that both Metcalf and Hunter hope can filter into their respective sports.“Netball was one of the hardest hit sports by the pandemic,” Metcalf said. “After a difficult couple of years, participation is rising again and we want to keep that going and get back to where we were before Covid struck. The more people involved in the game, at all ages, the better!Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player“I would love to see more coverage of different women’s sports across all media platforms and for more sportswomen to have the opportunity to go fully professional - netball included.”Hunter, meanwhile, feels that a lack of full-time professional teams across the world has hindered the progress of women’s rugby globally.“If we look at the recent World Cup, only ourselves, New Zealand and Wales were full-time professional teams there. Italy and France have part-time contracts with Scotland and Ireland in recent weeks handing out full-time contracts. However, players have been expected to be professional in every approach to playing at an international level but while having to go to work to pay bills and afford to live.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player“We are at a stage of the game now where countries need to invest in their female players for the game to move to the next level globally. Our game is now at a level where it's not fair and sustainable for female rugby players to be asked to work full-time and be an international player.”That investment can come in other areas too, as Chadwick highlighted.“W Series, unfortunately, fell through (this season) because it lacked investors and people getting involved,” she said. “But then you look at the England women’s rugby team still flying places in economy class, and that's for them trying to go and win the World Cup. We’re still lacking the financial support of the men's counterparts but there's been a massive step forward.”Progress can also happen fast if given the right backing to flourish, with McCann citing UFC’s rapid rise.“Women have only been involved in UFC since 25 February 2013, so it’s not even 10 years and look at where we are. Women’s football has absolutely transcended, especially this year, and yet they were banned from playing for 50 years.“Misogynistic people can dampen our spirit or try to put us down when we’re just doing well and doing our best.”What all the sportswomen questioned are in agreement with is the pride and emotion they felt at watching the Lionesses break new ground this summer and how it has changed the landscape for girls and women getting into sport.“It’s changed women’s sport, it’s changed perceptions even more,” Knight, who watched the final with her England team at their Commonwealth Games hotel in Birmingham.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player“Different people follow women’s sport, you see how the status of the Lionesses has deservedly changed and hopefully it inspires a generation of people, a generation of women to play sport and also change perceptions from what it was.”“And it proved a point,” Jonas adds. “Some of the barriers that we have as female sport is [perception that] ‘we’re not successful,’ ‘we’re not as good as the men,’ ‘we’re not as commercially viable as the men,’ all that stuff. But all the sellout games proved that wrong.So the message is clear: 2022 was a great year for women’s sport but watch this space for the next chapter.Heather Knight: Inspiring, progressive and exciting.Jamie Chadwick: Inspirational, milestones and proud.Molly McCann: It came home. (In terms of myself, I fought in London, Savannah Marshall fought in London, the Lionesses won in London, it came home for all of us).Natasha Jonas: Visible, exciting and successful.Nat Metcalf: Captivating, empowering and united.Sarah Hunter: Game-changing, inspiring and successful.Knight: The Test match we had in Australia, it ended in a draw, but was an absolute thriller, went down to the final hour of the final day, plenty of twists and turns, really exciting. We were gutted to finish with a draw but looking back it was an amazing Test match - the best Test match I’ve ever been involved in.Chadwick: For me being biased, it was me winning the British W Series race - and also George Russell winning (his maiden F1 victory) in Brazil.McCann: UFC London in March. It was the first overseas event we had got to do for a few years because of Covid. It was the first UFC event that the European fans had been able to go to, I felt like every British fighter brought it with some mad finishes. It was the breakout moment for our gym.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerJonas: For me, it’s a toss-up between Chantelle [Cameron] becoming the undisputed super-lightweight champion with a very, very good performance against McCaskill. But also Nina Hughes [winning a title]. Obviously, those are my two team-mates from GB. Nina within five fights has become a world champion. Everyone was saying she was too old and she didn’t have it. She proved them all wrong and won that world title against a very good Jamie Mitchell.Metcalf: It was an amazing feeling to be selected to represent Team England at the 2022 Commonwealth Games alongside so many incredibly talented athletes. Seeing the netball venue sell out for every game was an unreal feeling and I felt so proud to represent my country. Although finishing fourth was really tough, it was a huge honour to take part in a home CWG and see the country unite and celebrate netball together.On the club front, it was awesome to be back in the Netball Super League with Manchester Thunder after four seasons away Down Under. It was an extremely competitive season back here and to top it off winning the title following an unbeaten season, alongside an incredible group was a truly special feeling.Hunter: The World Cup final! Despite the result not being what we wanted it was an incredible game to be part of. A sell-out of 42,000 at Eden Park was a record-breaking crowd for women's rugby and the atmosphere was unbelievable even if the majority were supporting New Zealand. I genuinely believe and hope it is a moment we will look back and say this is when women's rugby was put on the map worldwide.Knight: Another great year. We’ve got an Ashes series at home which is always great fun, a T20 World Cup away from home in South Africa and The Hundred has just got better and better each year, the support and quality of the cricket has been unreal.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerJonas: I think we always knew how good women’s boxing is at its highest level. We just needed the world to see it and I think fans can expect from boxing, especially female boxing, some of the biggest fights, the best challenging the best which is something we don’t always get in the men’s, exciting fights and genuine 50-50s. When the best fight the best, you never know which way it’s going to go.Metcalf: We’re heading into a World Cup year in netball so it’s a great time to get involved and join us on our journey. We also have the new Netball Super League season - 10 teams competing to lift the trophy, it’s going to be very exciting! Each season gets tougher and more competitive and we’re seeing more fans attending and more coverage on TV. Get yourself to a game and see the high skill out on court and feel the high-energy atmosphere!""On the international stage we have two events to start the New Year - a home series against the CWG silver medalists Jamaica followed by the Netball Quad Series in Cape Town with four of the top-six nations. It’s currently so tight at the top of world netball so it’ll be very exciting to see what happens in South Africa before we return there in July for the Netball World Cup!""

It's been difficult being out for this long - I don’t think I've had this [long a lay-off] before - but at the same time, we are top of the league and playing really well, so I can’t complain! I am just going to kick on from here.""Smith Rowe described his lengthy absence from the squad through injury as ""tough"", but credited the support he received from our squad as invaluable. ""The whole team was around me. [Arteta] really helped me and obviously, I had my family back home supporting me. So it was really tough, but I managed to get through it and I'm just happy I’m fully fit now.""






Boss Mikel Arteta has previously spoken about keeping Smith Rowe close to the squad in order to expedite his recovery. ""I was pretty much with them from the start after surgery. I was in all the meetings, trying to keep up with the knowledge and learnings every day that we needed to apply in training.""It has been much easier than I thought. I am just happy to be back now,"" he added.When asked whether his injury came at an especially unlucky time considering a spot in Gareth Southgate's England squad for the World Cup was potentially on the cards, the 22-year-old had few regrets. ""Obviously, you always want to play for your country. But at the same time, I had to do what was right for my body. I am still young, so I will keep working hard to get more opportunities for the national team. But right now, I just need to focus on Arsenal and getting some more minutes.The groin injury that set him back at the beginning of this season has been a long-standing affliction for Smith Rowe, since his loan spell with RB Leipzig in 2019. ""A lot of people might not know, but I have had this injury since I was 18/19. It has been quite hard to deal with it over the years. But I am really happy that it is just finally over. I had a successful surgery and I am really feeling really good.""Looking ahead to the North London Derby away at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Smith Rowe has fond memories of the encounter in 2021 which saw him bag a goal and an assist in a 3-1 win over our local rivals.

Wiegman: Euros changed women’s football and we are not finished,Sky Sports,Maryam Chaudhary,2022-12-25,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/35730/12773382/sarina-wiegman-exclusive-england-womens-head-coach-on-euros-win-inspiring-young-people,"

Sarina Wiegman speaks exclusively to former England international Sue Smith for Sky Sports on leading Lionesses to historic Euros win, why the change to women’s football is not over, admiring her players for their work off the pitch and trying to win the World Cup in 2023By Maryam Chaudhary Sunday 25 December 2022 16:38, UKPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerFive months since the Lionesses created history and won the Euros, Sarina Wiegman reflects on a summer that transformed women's football.Wiegman was described by captain Leah Williamson as the ""missing ingredient"" the Lionesses needed to win their first major tournament. What is the legacy of that famous victory so far? How has women's football changed and what would winning the World Cup in 2023 mean? Sky Sports News spoke to the head coach of the England women's team at the stadium where they created history.England's previous major trophy was at the 1966 World Cup, and for Wiegman, reflecting on the summer of success still feels surreal. ""Incredible experience of course. Just a dream come true. So now it's time to sit down a little bit and actually process the whole thing,"" Wiegman told Sky Sports pundit and former Lioness Sue Smith at Wembley.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerWiegman is the first manager to lead two different nations to a European trophy having also triumphed with Netherlands in 2017, but are there any differences between winning in the Netherlands and winning in England?""There is a difference,"" Wiegman says in an extended interview. ""First of all in the Netherlands the expectations weren't as high as they were in England. And the chance of winning the Euros was really, really small. I think the impact in the Netherlands was high but here in England it's so much higher.""What about the impact on the Women's Super League?Wiegman, the first coach to win two consecutive Women's Euros with two different countries, says: ""That's one of the best leagues in the world, but impacting the fans coming to the big stadium. So we had 40,000, 44,000, 30,000 people. That's really incredible. So it reflects on both sides.""

            ""But also, what changed in society?"" she asks. ""Everyone is so proud of us, and you can feel it when they tell you. And that's what we wanted - to make people proud of us. And we've been so inspirational to young kids and people.""Earlier this summer, an open letter was signed by all 23 members of the England squad calling for the then Conservative Party leadership candidates Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss to give every girl in the nation the chance to follow in their footsteps and play football at school.Wiegman adds: ""I really, really like to see that the team has been so socially conscious. Writing the letter after the Euros and asking for access for every girl in football and at a younger age, and that's still going on and that's really good.""In the interview Smith asks Wiegman: ""Did you feel that pressure of things outside of football, not just focusing on the football itself?""Wiegman says: ""No, I didn't feel that pressure. We just wanted to win the Euros. We just wanted to win every game. And yes, here you talk about football. You talk about a lot of other things going on in society that's different than it was in the Netherlands.""The players are so mature and they're so conscious and they really want to make a difference and it's so powerful. That's another thing - I'm really proud of their personalities. They are good people.""Utrecht turned orange in 2017 as Netherlands celebrated winning the Euros with the team parading on a canal boat. Five years later, Wiegman and the Lionesses proudly celebrated their win at Trafalgar Square. Does she have a favourite?""That's really hard to say,"" she says. ""I grew up in the Netherlands so I lived through the whole development of the game. I could never ever imagine that we could we go in a boat and see all these people. The same with Trafalgar Square. The whole history here and all these former players being so proud.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player""So good to do that all together. We can all be so proud of that.""Smith asks: ""There are so many iconic moments looking back. Thinking of the eight goals against Norway, the Georgia Stanway screamer, the Alessia Russo cheeky backheel, the Chloe Kelly celebrations. What was your favourite or is it difficult to pick a favourite?""Wiegman says: ""I have many favourites from the tournament but one I pick out all the time is the Spain game.""Leading up to the game, Wiegman contracted COVID-19 and was unsure whether or not she would be able to attend, but thankfully she was given the all-clear.""This game [against Spain] was so intense, but everything was in this game, what we had been working on together from September last year until that moment. We said we wanted to stick with the plan. Everyone's doing the role. Then the role has to be clear, keep working as a team, we worked on scenarios when we have to force a goal.""And then Georgia had the shot in the transition moment. And I was like 'wow' against a country like Spain. Lots of countries they just drop back against Spain, but we tried to just press high.""That's what we saw in the World Cup too, you can play at your highest level and sometimes still lose because the other team is really good too. That's what sticks with me because so many things, so many parts of the puzzle fell in and came together.""One memorable moment was at Wiegman's press conference, the pictures of goalkeeper Mary Earps dancing on the table with the squad singing 'It's coming home'.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerSmith asks: ""Have you learned the words to 'It's coming home?' I won't get you to sing it!""""I'm a really poor singer, so you don't want me to sing,"" Wiegman laughs.""I suppose that just showed the personality of the team and the sort of togetherness that you all had. I've obviously played for my country for a long period of time, and we had some great teams and we got to the final in 2009 but unfortunately got beaten by Germany. But I've never got my hands on a trophy.""When you're in that moment, you actually don't realise. You don't really realise until you sit down and reflect and then you're like, 'oh … what happened?' But you move on too, because now we're preparing for the World Cup, and we really want to do well.""So you have that moment and we had to continue really quickly because after a month we already had to play Austria. It just went really quick.""Smith asks Wiegman: ""Has your life changed, are people stopping you on the street and asking for selfies?""The 53-year-old admits: ""It changed a little bit after the Euros in 2017. In England, everything is 10 times more, 10 times bigger. So yeah, people are proud, and they thank me a lot for what we have done this summer.""Over 87,000 spectators attended the final at Wembley, a record for the tournament. One of the effects was the north London derby in September which saw over 47,000 fans, setting a new attendance record.Smith adds: ""The knock-on effect is obviously a 200 per cent increase in the WSL attendance.

There's so much potential, there's so much quality and the fundament was there"".""The last three big tournaments, the team made it until the semi-finals. That's pretty good. But they did feel that they were sometimes maybe underperforming, although they really thought that they could do better and win.""And what we noticed in September last year was that some players said and truly believed it, but some players said that, but they didn't truly believe it yet. We thought, okay, then we have to build on that and we have to play games against big countries to show ourselves that we can do that.""As a result of her conversations with the team, Wiegman mentions they played ""not to win, but to prevent mistakes"".""And we in encouraged the team all the time, that you have to take action and when you take action, you make mistakes because football is a game of making mistakes.

Wiegman has a clear idea.She says: ""Women's football has changed so much, the level! The level of the game increased so much, but also so many things around besides football. So my role changed a lot too.""When I started, basically I did everything myself because you didn't have all the people around. And now [on her role and how the game has developed], it's shifted a little bit to a more manager role, but the technical staff are so, so good. So we really have a big good collaboration that you split responsibilities.""Wiegman is Dutch and Smith asks her about the debate over the nationality of the England coach.""The men's World Cup has finished. And there's a lot of talk about English managers managing England. The manager that's actually brought success is from the Netherlands. Do you think that you have to be English to manage the England national team?"" Smith asks.""Obviously, I don't think so"", Wiegman replies. ""I think what England look for with the women's team is the right person at the right moments. And then we got in conversation [speaking about how she got the job], they were convinced that I was the best fit for this team at this moment with what I can bring.""Wiegman also says she tried to ""really get into the culture"".Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerShe says: ""Although England and the Netherlands is pretty close to each other.

When I came in, I had all the questions, 'Are you going to bring it home or are you going to do this? Are we finally going to win the tournament now?' Those are the expectations, that's the environment I work in.""I hope things go well. And I do my very best. I give my everything. And when it's not enough, it's very disappointing. But I know I've done everything. And so the players and so the staff will.""It's so tight you can play your very best game and still not win because sometimes you need a little luck.

Thirteen weeks ago Leupolz posted “Our newest Blue has arrived” on her Instagram account with a photo of her pushing a stroller.Prior to her absence, Leupolz had settled in and showed her quality with the team. She offered classic central midfield play that Chelsea sorely needed. She played an integral role in Chelsea’s capture of the league title in 2020-21, playing in 19 games, starting in 17. Prior to her absence, she made 7 appearances, 6 starts in 2021-22.'I’m Melanie Leupolz and my journey continues.'  She's here to stay, Blues!   pic.twitter.com/RafodePyt7Giving birth and returning to top flight football is a long road with very different challenges. Torn ligaments and broken bones heal or are surgically repaired then rehabilitated, but returning from pregnancy is a varied road. In a video accompanying her signing, Leupolz credits Chelsea’s work with her through her pregnancy and after as one of the key reasons she extended her contract.“So completing this journey, especially in women’s football, but I’m proud that I can do both and get a lot of support from the club. That’s also a big point why I signed again for Chelsea. That’s why it wasn’t a big choice to make, I just knew I want to stay here at this club.”-Melanie Leupolz; source: Chelsea FCWBecoming a mother is important for some players, and providing the support to allow them to do that without sacrificing the rest of their careers is important. It should be the standard, but it isn’t yet.Chelsea have an exceptional track record in working with players through a multitude of recoveries. Fran Kirby was given the time and support to recover from pericarditis, marquee signing Lauren James required time and support to fully heal and build up from injuries, and now Melanie Leupolz in her return after pregnancy.One of the reasons Chelsea remains patient with recoveries is because the standard is high, and the ambitions are higher. When players are ready, they return to the pitch on absolute fire. Fran Kirby had a career year during her return and James has re-introduced herself to the WSL and is already one of its most technically skilled and fun players to watch.When Melanie Leupolz is ready to return to match action, expect it to be well worth the wait. Until then, tide yourself over by rewatching this ridiculous strike.An unforgettable goal in Blue  Wishing a very happy birthday to Melanie Leupolz!  pic.twitter.com/5ttaZ8SUbnCheck your inbox for a welcome email.Oops.

Arsenal Women play their final WSL game of 2022, as they travel to the Midlands to face 5th placed Aston Villa at Villa Park. Here are three things to watch for. Rachel Daly was Aston Villa’s big summer signing, and one who has put Villa at the top of the rest of the WSL. Broadly speaking, the midtable of the WSL have teams that are well-organized and have a good defensive shape. The big difference between Aston Villa, Tottenham, and Everton is that Aston Villa have a striker who scores goals. Rachel Daly was often prolific in the NWSL, with Houston, and she’s the joint top scorer in the WSL this season, with 8 goals, albeit with 3 from the penalty spot. Still, 5 non-penalty goals puts her level with Sam Kerr (and Frida Maanum). Daly can drop deep to knit play, but she feasts on crosses, with service coming from Alisha Lehmann and Kirsty Hanson. Kenza Dalí joined in the summer and has added creativity to Villa’s midfield. Villa are third in the WSL in crosses into the penalty area per game, with Hanson, Lehmann and right back Sarah Mayling playing the most per game. Mayling is also Villa’s top progresser from the back. Arsenal have had a tactical rejig in recent weeks. With Beth Mead out and Lina Hurtig out, and Mana Iwabuchi not favoured, Katie McCabe has been the right winger almost by default, as soon as she wasn’t required at left back. McCabe plays as an inverted winger on the right hand side, which is contrary to how Beth Mead plays on the right. McCabe will act almost as a third central midfielder or #10, which allows Vivianne Miedema to push higher up. As a result, there’s space on the right hand side. On Wednesday, Stina Blackstenius exploited that space to set up Miedema’s winner against Juventus, with Blackstenius’ cross set up by a dink from Leah Williamson. Williamson is unlikely to start, having started midweek, but Rafaelle Souza should return. Rafaelle has the ability to play diagonals, but also plays longer passes down the wing or into the channel. Stina Blackstenius assisted Vivianne Miedema’s winner against Juventus, but she hasn’t scored in over a month for Arsenal, last netting against Leicester City. In this four match scoreless run, Blackstenius has had chances, but just hasn’t been able to convert, with an xG from the four games of 1.6. Shots haven’t been lacking; she’s taken 13, and has been somewhat unlucky, having hit the woodwork, but Arsenal will need her to find her scoring boots again. Essentially, the underlying numbers are fine, but with two crucial games after Villa, against Lyon and Zurich in the Champions League, a goal for Blackstenius would be very valuable heading into the final stretch of matches in the year. Player to watch: Laura WienroitherLaura Wienroither has wrestled the starting right back role from Noëlle Maritz, and has done nothing to cede the role. There’s a new challenge for Wienroither now, though; with McCabe ahead of her, there’s more space for Wienroither, but also more passing and creative responsibility. One thing Wienroither is very good at doing is being a direct player, including getting into the attacking and final third. With Arsenal’s switches of play, that could be a route to goal, with build-up play down the left.Predicted lineup (4231): 1. Zinsberger; 26. Wienroither, 3. Wubben-Moy, 2. Rafaelle Souza, 7. Catley; 12. Maanum, 13. Wälti; 15. McCabe, 11. Miedema, 19. Foord; 25. BlacksteniusSubstitutes: 18. Marckese, 5. Beattie, 6. Williamson, 8. Nobbs, 16. Maritz, 23. Iwabuchi, 59.

The match kicks off at 16:15 UK and you can watch live on Sky Sports. Our Gunners will be hoping to secure their eighth win of the WSL season today to keep pace with Chelsea and Manchester United at the top of the WSL table.Alongside Chelsea and Manchester United, Arsenal have only lost one game this season. Arsenal in 3rd place in the WSL behind 2nd place Man United (on goal difference) and 1st place Chelsea (who have played an extra game over ourselves and Man United. This is the current top 8 in the WSL leader board:Having won their last 2 games with 1-0 victories over Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday evening, and Everton in the Women’s Super League the previous weekend an in-form Vivianne Miedema (having been the sole goalscorer in both games) joins a squad bouncing back from injuries as our Gunners head to Villa Park.We published a full form guide earlier this week.  Defensively our Gunners are very strong but they do have to become more clinical in front of the goal and increase that shot to goal ratio significantly.If Arsenal can do this it should be a reasonably easy game for them to handle, with my score prediction being Aston Villa 0 – 3 Arsenal.The last time Arsenal met Villa in May 2022 , they put seven past them at Meadow Park. A brace from Vivianne Miedema, alongside goals from Beth Mead, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Stina Blackstenius, and Nikita Paris made it for one to forget for the Villans. Watch the goal-fest here:Arsenal were 4-0 winners last time they visited Villa Park, with Kim Little, Mana Iwabuchi, and Katie McCabe all on the scoresheet.  Watch the highlights here:Eidevall confirmed, in his pre-Villa presser, that there was no new team news.  Leah Williamson and Rafaelle Souza are back in action after 2 months off with injury.  Captain Kim Little and Lina Hurtig and not expected to be ready to join Arsenal for this game.So let’s hope that our Gunners can crank up the goal tally today – maximum goals and maximum points is what we need!COYG!Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here….",[],

Let’s celebrate Arsenal Women’s highs of the 2022-23 season so far,Just Arsenal News,Michelle,2022-12-28,https://www.justarsenal.com/lets-celebrate-arsenal-womens-highs-of-the-2022-23-season-so-far/326992,"Let’s celebrate Arsenal Women’s highs of the 2022-23 season so far by MichelleArsenal Women are currently on their Christmas break, returning to action in their biggest Women’s Super League game this season so far when they welcome top of the league Chelsea to Emirates Stadium on Sunday 15th January 2023.Our Gunners are currently sitting 2nd in the WSL having won eight and lost one of their 9 matches played this season so far, sitting 3 points below Chelsea but Arsenal have a game in hand (away to Manchester City which should have been their 1st game of the season but was postponed due to her Majesty the Queen’s passing).  Arsenal also secured qualification to the quarter-final’s of the UEFA Women’s Champions League.  They fought through a tough group and finished top, ahead of reigning champions Lyon, Juventus and Zurich.One of the real highlights of the season so far for Arsenal has got to be when Arsenal Women broke the WSL attendance record with over 47,000 bums on seats at Emirates Stadium when they thrashed Tottenham Hotspur 4-0.  The atmosphere was electric! Another indisputable highlight is when Arsenal played their opening Champions League group game away to reigning champions Lyon, in October, with our Gunners smashing Lyon by an astonishing 5-1 in a landmark victory, who have won the Champions league an incredible eight times.Video: Lyon v Arsenal Women – Brilliant highlights of landmark 5-1 winStand-out players for me this season so far have got to be Frida Maanum and Laura Weinroither, winners of Arsenal’s Player of the Month in October and November.  Frida Maanum really gave Vivianne Miedema a run for her money early season, with Miedema struggling to get time off the bench.  Maanum has been a tremendous asset in the midfield.  And Laura Weinroither has excelled at right-back, particularly stepping up when Arsenal had to cope with injuries to both Leah Williamson & Rafaelle Souza early in the season.All in all, the highs have been very high indeed.

Tottenham 0-2 Aston Villa: player ratings to the theme of 2023 Spurs New Years resolutions,SB Nation,Dustin George-Miller,2023-01-03,https://cartilagefreecaptain.sbnation.com/2023/1/3/23537069/tottenham-0-2-aston-villa-player-ratings-to-the-theme-of-2023-spurs-new-years-resolutions,"We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content and targeted ads, analyze site traffic, and understand where our audiences come from.

But that’s what you get when you start out the new year with a distressing 2-0 home loss to Aston Villa and their Business-Casual Dracula manager Unai Emery. Now, a chance to turn over a new leaf has turned into an injury crisis, a grumpy manager, and chants of “Daniel Levy, get out of club” at full time.But that’s not to say that Spurs can’t turn it around. There’s nothing so toxic that a couple of wins can’t fix, and Spurs will have an opportunity to do just that tomorrow at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace.But first, we need to talk about that match. It was bad. We’re gonna do the player rating thing, but for the theme let’s keep it hopeful (at least mostly). Here are your player ratings for Tottenham’s 2-0 loss to Aston Villa to the theme of New Year’s resolutions for the club in 2023.Player performance and qualifying for Champions League is obviously important, but Spurs are struggling in other areas too — specifically in the backroom areas of recruitment, analytics, and sports science, all areas where Spurs have lurched to and fro over the years based on the whims of whatever coach was in charge. It’s crazy and it’s reflected in their spotty transfer record over the past five years or so. Most other clubs either have or are developing these areas, specifically in analytics. While Spurs are bolstering their recruitment with the additions of Paratici and Steinsson, it’s not clear what they’re using (beyond existing contacts) to identify targets. Spurs could do a lot of good for themselves if they would flesh out and develop the parts of the club that few fans rarely see so there’s at least a coherent back office that can guide the overall direction of the club.Hahaha, yeah nobody was in this categoryDaniel Levy has been unquestionably outstanding in how he took Tottenham from a mid-table cup team to a big club. He has not been good at figuring out what to do now that Spurs ARE a big club. And that’s a problem. Spurs used to be the scrappy underdog that punched above its weight, but while it’s now in an entirely new weight class, the big dogs have only gotten bigger in the ensuing years. Spurs need to figure out its identity. Are they the Dortmund of the Premier League — buying undervalued young talents, developing them, and selling them for big money to reinvest? Or are they going to start throwing their financial weight around in order to slug it out with the Citys, Chelseas, Uniteds, and (now) Newcastles? Right now, the answer is neither and it’s one of the reasons why the club is in the position its in.LOL nobody was here either, this sucks BeavisIn some ways the appointment of Conte was a gimme — he was easily the best manager available at the time and probably the most talented and proven manager in recent history, a list that includes Jose Mourinho. But it’s also a weird fit for this club in particular that isn’t know for spending tons of money on players like Conte demands. Now with Conte’s Spurs team half-formed and results not coming, Spurs are in this weird nether-region where they aren’t sure whether to back Conte fully, especially if Conte isn’t planning on sticking around long term. But they’re close to the point where they’ll have to make a decision — either back him fully or pull the plug. They could be wrong with either choice, but if they go with half-measures they’ll DEFINITELY be wrong. Time to put all the chips on the table.Cuti Romero (Community — 3.0):  Welcome back, Cuti. Bless him, he did well in his first match back after the World Cup, even pushing forward and operating as a quasi-forward at times because nobody else seemed to. Picked up a yellow card because of course he did.Matt Doherty (Community — 2.5): Dohertinho seemed to find some sort of rapport with Bryan Gil even if it didn’t really lead to any big chances. Had a pretty audacious nutmeg in the first half that made me chortle. Would like to see him more with Kulusevski. Wasn’t the problem on Sunday.This is tied in with Tottenham’s overall strategy, but the academy is stuck between competing impulses. Spurs have spent a lot of energy recruiting young talent to its academy, but with Conte at the helm doesn’t provide a pathway to the first team. One option is to create a Chelsea-style loan army and flip them for a small profit, but Spurs don’t seem to want to do that either, as there’s a prevailing guiding principle that Tottenham should be generating their own talent. Something has to change because Spurs are losing youth players to other clubs. Spurs needs to figure out what they want out of the academy — money, or future first teamers — and stick to it.Clement Lenglet (Community — 2.5): I thought he was fine, mostly? A little lost in the build-up to Villa’s second goal, but didn’t seem out of place in the central CB ahead of Dier. A bad day for Spurs defense overall, sure. Clement didn’t really do anything that egregious to add to it. Picked up probably the only actually deserved yellow in the first half.Ben Davies (Community — 2.5): IDK man, it was a bad day but he wasn’t any worse than Clement, really. He ran around a lot. Got worked a couple of times by Watkins.Ivan Perisic (Community — 2.5):  Did well to set up Kane’s saved header. Had one of Tottenham’s best scoring opportunities in the second half. Switched flanks late and pushed forward but wasn’t very effective with the match already decided.This should be several tiers higher, to be honest, but I wanted to make sure it was included. Spurs deserve credit for taking the Women from the fourth tier all the way to the WSL, but the overall support, both financial and otherwise, has been mostly meager. WOSO is a huge market with incredible growth potential, and there’s no reason (beyond just not caring) not to invest in it. There’s a strong rumor that Spurs are going to break the WSL intra-league transfer record with a bid for Chelsea Women’s Beth England. That’s fantastic news, but hopefully only the start. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (Community — 2.5): You kind of know what you’re getting with Hojbjerg — lots of work and the occasional goal but not a ton of progressive passing. When it works, it works. When it doesn’t, it can be pretty awful to watch. It didn’t work on Sunday.Ryan Sessegnon (Community — 2.0): Offered very little on the left flank after coming on as a sub.It’s obvious, I know, but this really is important because now that Newcastle has an endless Saudi money pit from which to draw funds, it’s going to be even tougher for Spurs to outspend their competitors. Even with the stadium, that Champions League money goes a long, long way. A club like Spurs with their new stadium needs to be playing at the highest level or find themselves slipping back behind the usual suspects.Hugo Lloris (Community — 1.5): Yeah, the ball took a short hop, but Hugo still should’ve saved that shot. He didn’t, the rebound ended up with Buendia, and everything went off the rails after that. I’d still rather Hugo than Forster, though. Yves Bissouma (Community — 2.0): Whoof. Another disappointing performance in Spurs’ midfield. Surely a part of that was Spurs being outnumbered in that area of the pitch, but he just doesn’t seem to work in tandem with Hojbjerg. Got torched and then made a dumb tactical foul, picking up his fifth yellow so he’s suspended tomorrow.Bryan Gil (Community — 2.0): I just don’t know what Bryan does. He’s got a good motor, but doesn’t really pass well and doesn’t create his own shot. I’m glad he’s getting minutes, and Conte seemed satisfied with whatever he was doing out there so what do I know?Harry Kane (Community — 2.0): Hey did you guise know that Harry Kane didn’t touch the ball for the first 19 minutes of the first half? As annoying as the ongoing match commentary was, they were right — Kane was a non-factor apart from the header that was saved by Villa’s keeper. With Kane, you need him to either take shots, or generate chances for others. Sure, his service was garbage, but he didn’t do either on Sunday.Son Heung-Min (Community — 2.0): The only good highlight Son had on Sunday was watching him get torched, make a recovery tackle, and then tear off his mask and throw it off the pitch. I was hoping that was his superhero reveal moment. It was the only good thing he did. I’m worried about him, y’all.Antonio Conte (Community — 1.5): I know he has his hands tied with injuries and a bench he doesn’t like, but he has to do SOMETHING to alleviate these god-awful performances. Switch formations! Go to a back four! Put Harvey White in as a creative mid! Try something risky and insane!  Continually running into a wall doesn’t work, no matter how many patterns you drill.To be fair, if you’re an ENIC-OUTer this is probably your five star category, but not for me for the simple truth that whoever buys Tottenham Hotspur is likely going to be far, far worse than Daniel Levy and ENIC ever were. If we’re lucky, the new owner will be some sort of conglomerate bid, or a super huge bank/hedge fund hoping to leverage investments. At worst, it’s either or a bored billionaire with nothing to do with their money who wants to treat the club like a plaything, or the sovereign wealth fund of a middle eastern country hoping to sportswash their way out of horrific human rights abuses. I’m not ready to take that risk yet and hope the club doesn’t go there.No Tottenham Hotspur players were as bad as selling the club to a foreign sovereign wealth fund.Pape Sarr, Emerson Royal, Oliver Skipp, Djed Spence* 21+ (19+ CA-ONT) (18+ NH/WY).

Beth Mead wants research into why so many female players suffer horror knee injuries,Daily Mail,David Coverdale,2022-12-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-11567473/Beth-Mead-wants-research-female-players-suffer-horror-knee-injuries.html,"By David Coverdale For The Daily Mail  Published:  22:30, 22 December 2022   |  Updated:  00:23, 23 December 2022    3View  commentsBeth Mead wants to spearhead research into why so many female footballers suffer serious knee injuries — claiming the authorities would do a lot more if it was a crisis in the men’s game.The newly crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament last month and is a major doubt for next summer’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, when the Lionesses will try to repeat their success at Euro 2022.Mead’s partner and Arsenal team-mate Vivianne Miedema also injured her ACL last week, meaning five of the top 16 players in October’s Ballon d’Or vote are out with the same problem. That includes the winner Alexia Putellas, and the only other women to have previously claimed the prestigious award — Megan Rapinoe and Ada Hegerberg — have both had ACL injuries in the past.Sports Personality of the Year Beth Mead has called for research into why so many female footballers have suffered serious knee injuries - with the England star one of which affectedMead and her partner and Arsenal team-mate Vivianne Miedema (right) are both out of action with ACL injuries and turned up to the Sports Personality of the Year awards on crutches‘I think if that happened with Messi, Ronaldo, Griezmann there’s probably going to be a lot more done,’ said England star Mead, who was the Ballon d’Or runner-up after claiming the Golden Boot at the Euros.Mead joins the list of high-profile players to suffer an ACL injury:Vivianne Miedema (Arsenal and Netherlands)Alexia Putellas (Barcelona and Spain)Marie-Antoinette Katoto (PSG and France)Catarina Macario (Lyon and USA)Ellie Carpenter (Lyon and Australia)‘I see myself as quite a robust player but this has still happened. Viv’s also quite a robust player. We’ve not generally been hit with injuries, so I do think we need to look into it a lot more.‘There doesn’t seem to be a lot of research going on. Unfortunately, this has happened to us but hopefully it can kick somebody up the a*** to go on and start doing something.‘It’s something I would like to push forward — I have plenty of time to do so now.’A previous study found that female athletes are up to six times more likely to suffer ACL injuries than men. One reason given is that changing hormones across the menstrual cycle can affect the physiology and biomechanics of the body and create looser joints.However, the FA conducted their own study into the prevalence of ACL injuries in women’s football over the last four seasons and found they accounted for just 1.3 per cent of all injuries. Yet in the Women’s Super League alone, 10 senior players are out with the problem.Lionesses boss Sarina Wiegman said: ‘FIFA, UEFA and the federations have to do something about this. There’s lots of research in the men’s game, but not the women’s.Mead will miss the rest of the WSL season ahead of the World Cup after rupturing her ACL‘Women are built differently from men, the hips and the knees are different, the angles are different. We will also talk about scheduling because now the top-level players will have five consecutive tournaments in a row. The demands of the game are getting higher and higher.’ACL injuries usually take at least nine months to return from, meaning Mead will miss the rest of the WSL season ahead of the World Cup.‘I’m two weeks post-op now and I’m in a really good position,’ added Mead. ‘It’s a difficult one to put a time stamp on because you can wake up one morning and it’s stiff and you can’t do anything and another morning you feel you could run on the pitch.‘I’m going to take each day as it comes, that’s what Mum has always told me, and I will work my a*** off in that gym to get myself in the best possible position for next year.’Sarina Wiegman joined Mead in calling for research into the number of serious knee injuriesAlexia Putellas is another big-name player who has suffered a serious knee injuryMeanwhile, Mead’s fellow SPOTY nominee Eve Muirhead fears for the future of curling after revealing that ice rinks are under threat of closure due to rising energy prices.The Scot, 32, finished third on Wednesday night after leading Britain’s women’s curling team to gold at the Winter Olympics in February.But although she hopes her Olympic and SPOTY success can inspire the next generation into her sport, she worries that the facilities may not be there for them to try it out.‘An ice rink is not cheap to run and there are some that could go. That would be devastating,’ she said. ‘It would be great if we didn’t see doors closing and, if anything, see more doors open.’

Form Guide, Facts & Stats",Just Arsenal News,Michelle,2022-12-14,https://www.justarsenal.com/arsenal-women-v-lyon-champions-league-clash-form-guide-facts-stats/325810,"Arsenal Women v Lyon Feminin Champions League clash. Form Guide, Facts & Stats by MichelleTomorrow evening Arsenal Women will face Olympique Lyonnais Feminin. at Emirates Stadium in their penultimate group stage match in the UEFA Women’s Champions League.  It’s a late one with an 8PM UK kick-off.  There have been rail strikes yesterday and today and more are scheduled for 16th & 17th December but travelling to the Emirates tomorrow should be fine, certainly with no planned strike action.  Tickets are still available to purchase here.  Arsenal’s final group match is away in Zurich on 21st December and our Gunners are largely expected to win that match, having beaten Zurich 3-1 in the first leg.Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall spoke to the press after Arsenal’s most recent win, away at Villa Park, when our Gunners beat Aston Villa 4-1 at the weekend.  Asked if he’s excited about Arsenal’s upcoming Champions League match Eidevall said Very. I mean, huge game against Lyon. It’s the European champions to come here to London at the Emirates. Be there, be there to support us. We need that. We need to create a great atmosphere at the Emirates. We need to fight for every second of it, and if we do and if we do our very best, maybe we can achieve qualification.Arsenal currently sit at the top of Group C.  Here are the current Group C standings with still 2 more 2nd leg games to be played:Aside from a 1-1 draw away at Juventus, Arsenal have won the rest of their group matches including a 5-1 away win at Lyon in the group stage opening match.  Lyon have won their 2 most recent games but they have both been against bottom of the group Zurich and they have yet to face Arsenal in the 2nd leg tomorrow with their final group game at home to Juventus.Lyon will be heading to the Emirates with hope in their hearts.  They really need to leave with a point or 3 under their belts to keep their Champions League hopes alive.  But our Gunners, returning to much better form with the recent return of key players Leah Williamson and Rafaelle Souza and the imminent return of Captain Kim Little and Lina Hurtig.Arsenal currently sit in 2nd position in the Women’s Super League, second only to Chelsea who have played an extra game.  Lyon, however, are not currently performing well in France’s Ligue 1, being way down the table in 8th place.  Like Arsenal in recent times, Lyon are  dealing with a raft of medium and long term injured players which continues to seriously affect their performance.Based on all of the information detailed here I personally don’t think Lyon have a hope of taking points away from our Gunners tomorrow night.  Lyon’s form is abysmal while Arsenal have narrowly lost only 1 WSL game so far this season, whilst coping with a plethora of injuries.  If Lyon can’t take a point or 3 off Arsenal then the reigning champions could find themselves not even able to qualify beyond the group stages of the Champions League..Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here….",[],

You can see my Half-time Review here as Arsenal rounded off the first half ahead with Aston Villa 1 – 2 Arsenal.In summary, the first half consisted of a brilliant goal from Villa’s Kirsty Hanson in the 6th minutes with our Gunners going on the counter attack and taking a good command of the game.  Arsenal were then gifted an early Christmas present in the shape of an Aston Villa own goal when Katie McCabe’s ball into the box smacked off the legs of Rachel Corsie and ended up in the back of Villa’s net.  3 minutes later Vivianne scored in excellent Miedema style, taking our Gunners ahead by 2 goals to 1 as we went into the break.In the 2nd half Arsenal still looked dominant.  Williamson came on at 59 minutes for Rafaelle, who was in Eidevall’s starting XI for the first time since returning from injury.  3 minutes later Katie McCabe stuck a belter of a strike that went straight past Hannah Hampton and claimed Arsenal’s goal number 3.  Weinrother & Nobbs came on shortly after, substituting for Miedema & Martitz and Nobbs put Arsenal’s 4th goal into the back of the net 12 minutes after coming on!  A few minutes before full-time Mana Iwabuchi came off the bench as Foord came off – a rare pitch outing for the former Aston Villa player..Tonight marked Arsenal’s 200th appearance in the Barclays Women’s Super League and their performance was worthy of the occasion, with a BIG win in their last WSL game before the winter break.Aston Villa were loose in defence but looked a bit tidy when they did manage to get the ball and drive forward, narrowly missing a few opportunities in both the first and second half.The Arse certainly looked like they were enjoying getting back into their stride tonight.Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here….  A solid performance from the Ladies after going a goal down…👍🏾",[],

Villa moved into the lead 1-0 in the 6th minute..Arsenal did fight back valliantly and really started to take ownership of the game – they are really not used to conceding goals, of course.  Having had a few chances a great ball whipped in front of goal by Katie McCabe found a host of Villa players crowding the box.  Disaster for Villa!  Katie’s ball struck Villa’s Corsie creating a beautiful early Xmas present for Arsenal in a beautifully-wrapped own goal.  Phew!  We’re still only 26 minutes into the first half..Our Gunners continued to dominate from then and for the rest of the 1st half, with Villa finding themselves deficit in defence.  On the 29th minute Vivianne scored her 4th goal in as many games, in true Miedema style.  Scoreline going into half-time Villa 1 – 2 Arsenal.Our Gunners head into the break in the lead and looking confident.. roll on round 2!Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here….     ",[],

Eidevall happy with Arsenal Women’s improved efficiency in front of goal after beating Villa 4-1,Just Arsenal News,Michelle,2022-12-12,https://www.justarsenal.com/eidevall-happy-with-arsenal-womens-improved-efficiency-in-front-of-goal-after-beating-villa-4-1/325676,"Eidevall happy with Arsenal Women’s improved efficiency in front of goal after beating Villa 4-1 by MichelleArsenal boss Jonas Eidevall reflected on our Gunners comeback against Aston Villa at Villa Park, in Arsenal’s 200th match in the Barclays Women’s Super League, after Arsenal came back from 1-0 down to achieve a 4-1 win, with goals from Corsie (Villa own goal), Miedema, McCabe & Nobbs.See full Match Report and Match Highlights.Speaking after the game, Eidevall credited Arsenal’s composure after falling behind in the opening minutes of the game and our improved efficiency in front of goal saying:I’m happy that we stayed composed and patient when we went one goal behind. That’s always a difficult moment for any team but we managed that very well. We continued to create scoring opportunities. It was nice to see us put a few more of them away than we’ve done in recent games. So all in all, good.We knew this was going to be a difficult game and a lot of teams have a problem coming here to Villa Park, playing against a strong Aston Villa this year. So happy with the performance and it’s great to have three points.Speaking about Arsenal’s resilience to come back from one goal behind:I think so. Because one thing that is difficult at that moment is to not let the emotions take over. You want to correct things immediately and that can mean that you start stressing things, and you lose your formation, you lose your balance, and then maybe you get a counter-attack against you, and then there are two goals. Then all of a sudden, you have created a mountain to climb. But we took it step-by-step, so that was very good to see.on our improved efficiency in front of goal…And on our improved efficiency in front of goal after winning our last 2 games by a narrow margin of 1-0 he said:It’s good to see that we were a little bit more efficient in front of the goal. I know we have that quality, but it’s nice for the players to do that as well. And so that was good. And now we just need to recover, refresh and prepare for Lyon. That’s going to be a very exciting – but also difficult – match for us.Our Gunners don’t have a lot of time to rest as they prepare to welcome reigning champions Lyon to Emirates Stadium on Thursday 15th December, 8PM UK kick-off.  Tickets available here.  When asked if he was excited about Arsenal’s upcoming Champions League match Eidevall said:Very. I mean, huge game against Lyon. It’s the European champions to come here to London at Emirates. Be there, be there to support us. We need that. We need to create a great atmosphere at the Emirates. We need to fight for every second of it and if we do and if we do our very best, maybe we can achieve qualification.Interview courtesy of Arsenal.After Lyon on Thursday, Arsenal then head to Zurich on 21st December for their final match of the Champions League group stages before going into the winter break.So our Gunners have moved up to 2nd in the WSL table and are currently top of Group C in their Champions League campaign.  Hopefully they can round off these last 2 group games, knowing they’ve qualified for the UEFA Women’s Champions League.  That would be a great Xmas present for everyone!Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here…. ",[],

Look out for your first newsletter in your inbox soon!Time Out’s Londoner of the Year on QPR, sports bras and the aftermath of that historic day at WembleyIt’s a crisp, sunny Monday lunchtime in late October and a spontaneous round of applause has erupted from the astroturf pitches above Hoxton’s Britannia Leisure Centre. For the past hour or so, a low hum of excitable chatter has been punctuated only by the periodic thwack of footballs against walls. Forty-odd amateur players, from a host of local women’s teams, stand around doing keep-ups and taking turns to fire off shots at a goalkeeper on the far end of the pitch. But now Lioness Chloe Kelly is here, giving a meek wave as she steps onto the turf, and everyone is cheering like it’s July 31 all over again.  Five months earlier, the reaction of even the most ardent of women’s football fans to the arrival of the England forward might have been a little more muted. But that was before 23 million Brits tuned in to watch her punt the ball over the line in the 110th minute of extra time at this summer’s Women’s Euros Final, securing the Lionesses’ first ever major trophy in front of a record-breaking Wembley crowd. That was before her instantly iconic celebration – pausing just long enough to check that the goal would stand before whipping off her shirt and helicoptering it overhead, sports bra on full display – or an equally memorable post-match interview where she ran off with the microphone mid-sentence to join her teammates in an ecstatic rendition of ‘Sweet Caroline’. In short, that was before the 24-year-old from Ealing became a household name literally overnight.Coming out of her cageCage football is a big deal in London. The enclosed concrete pitches are the beating hearts of the city’s housing estates, places where kids congregate at all hours of the day and night to show off their skills in small-sided games, whooping and yelling every time someone pulls off an improbable dribble or an audacious nutmeg. Cage football is where most of the impressively large cohort of current London-born Premier League players cut their teeth, not to mention England legends like Alex Scott and Rio Ferdinand. And it’s the cage – one specific cage, on Southall’s Windmill Park Estate – where Chloe Kelly’s journey to European Champion began, with countless hours spent playing street football with her five older brothers. ‘I think my game is the way it is today, because of learning my trade that way rather than being coached,’ she explains. ‘When you play cage football there's not many rules, it's just go and be free and enjoy yourself and because there's so many people on that pitch you have to use your skill to get out of certain situations, but it's very physical at the same time, you're getting bounced off the cage fence,’ she says, miming being slammed off the wall. ‘Now, when I look at my career, I think I wouldn’t have been the player I am without those moments in the cages with my brothers being tough on me. I go there sometimes when I come home to see kids playing and it brings back so many memories, just walking past.’ West London to the world She might play her football in Manchester these days, but Chloe Kelly is west London through and through. Raised as an avid supporter of local Championship side Queen’s Park Rangers, it was the west London club’s crest that she was draped in when the BBC’s Rachel Brown-Finnis finally managed to drag her back for the second part of that post-victory interview, and the club’s home ground, Loftus Road, where she received a hero’s welcome on the opening day of the Premier League season, a week after scoring the goal that she described as her ‘Bobby Zamora moment’. But it’s also at her childhood club’s academy that she took her first steps towards a professional career. ‘My first game was at Loftus Road, so that was really special for me and my family,’ she remembers. ‘But I knew I had to take a step forward in my career and challenge myself more so I moved to Middlesex under 12s for one season and then I moved to Arsenal’. Breaking into the senior squad of English football’s most successful women’s team was quite the challenge. ‘There were so many great players in that team, the likes of Kelly Smith and Rachel Yankee. Kelly was my idol growing up so to share the pitch of her was incredible and I was learning so much. But it got to a point in my career where I had to be playing football and sitting on the bench was frustrating. So that’s when I made the move up north.’‘I was so, so homesick,’ Chloe says of her move to Everton, ‘but I knew that was what I needed to do to get where I am today.’ And while she’s now swapped Merseyside for Man City, she’s still a Londoner at heart.  ‘I always remember where I come from. London’s my roots. Even though I’ve been up north for so long, it’s always home.’After all, not many people can say that a London bus route has been named after them, a rare privilege that was bestowed on Chloe back in September when the number 92 from Ealing to Brent was christened in her honour. ‘I used to get the 92 from my house to Wembley to go and watch games,’ she recalls. ‘When I think about young girls like me seeing my name on the bus…it’s amazing.’ Changing the gameIt’s not always easy, being a newly minted national treasure. By the time we sit down for our chat – sequestered in a tiny staff room somewhere in the bowels of the Leisure Centre – Chloe must have signed at least three dozen autographs and posed for as many selfies over the course of a hectic day that saw her rise bright and early the morning after a league victory against Liverpool to make it today’s shoot. Another impromptu meet and greet with a handful of the venue’s enraptured staff will follow before the country’s new Patron Saint of Sports Bras is bundled into a taxi back up north. You get the sense that sort of thing happens just about everywhere she goes now. Take a recent night out with her England teammates in Manchester. ‘I’m on the way to meet the girls for team bonding and this car of women starts screaming out the window at me,’ she says. ‘So I'm dancing and waving at them, and then I look and I'm like “Wait, that wasn't my teammates.” I was really embarrassed, like, “How the hell do they know who I am?” And I think that's when I realised that things have changed so much.’And changed they most certainly have; the Lionesses’ victory has already inspired a dramatic uptick in interest in women’s football. Attendance figures for the Women’s Super League are up 50 percent on last season, and a new record was set in September when 47,000 fans watched the North London Derby at the Emirates. At-home audience figures are similarly encouraging, with Sky reporting that average audiences for WSL games have doubled in the same time. It’s overwhelmingly positive news for the future of the women’s game, but this is just the beginning. ‘Throughout the tournament Jill Scott kept saying “Something’s happening, something’s happening!” And it did, it was a special summer,’ Chloe says. ‘But now it’s about keeping our foot on the gas. It’s a great opportunity for everyone involved in women’s sport to push forward, but as soon as we take our foot off the gas it’s easy for everyone else to switch off.’ For Chloe, that means ensuring that the next generation of potential Euros winners is nurtured properly. It’s clearly a subject that the European champions are passionate about, with the squad having written a letter to the incumbent Prime Minister in the aftermath of their victory, calling on the government to support in ensuring that ‘every young girl in the nation’ is allowed to play football at school. ‘If we allow them the opportunity to play and give them the best possible chance, then there are many moments like the Euros that they can experience too,’ Chloe says. ‘But they need the opportunity to play first.’2023 and beyond The future certainly looks bright for women’s football in this country, but so does the present. Having breezed through their final round of qualifiers in the autumn, the Lionesses will travel to Australia next summer to compete in the 2023 Women’s World Cup. It’s an even bigger challenge for the European champions, but one that they’re excited to face, especially after coming out on top against a dominant USA team who currently hold the title. ‘It’s great to see where we’re at as a group against top opposition,’ Chloe says of that recent sold out friendly at Wembley. ‘I’m really driven and I want to achieve great things. The feeling of one medal around your neck is amazing but it just makes you want more success.’For now, that historic first medal is tucked safely away in her underwear drawer at home. And as for the sports bra? ‘I’m getting it framed.’Share the storyAn email you’ll actually loveBy entering your email address you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and consent to receive emails from Time Out about news, events, offers and partner promotions.🙌 Awesome, you're subscribed!Thanks for subscribing!

As Cooper hobbled away, Chelsea quickly took the free kick; the pass to Johanna Rytting Kaneryd - although offside - was squared to Fran Kirby to put the Blues into an early lead after 15 minutes.The Reading bench, with access to the replays, were visibly disappointed and felt let down again by the officials. Phil Cousins, the Royals’ head coach, picked up a yellow card on 20 minutes when his frustration understandably boiled over.It was a shame and real blow for the Royals who started the first quarter of the match well and were equal to the league leaders. Emma Harries kept the captain’s armband throughout the night and put in a super performance. She forced the first Royals corner of the match, on 11 minutes, taking on Magdalena Eriksson down the left wing.From the resultant corner the ball was cleared to Tia Primmer who, after scoring from outside the penalty area against Liverpool, was confident enough to take on another ambitious effort – this time the teenager seeing her attempted lob just too high of the Chelsea crossbar.There were a couple of early scares for the Royals too. Jacqueline Burns was called into action in the first four minutes, her punched clearance fired back in by Chelsea and blocked on the near post by some great recovery defending by Gemma Evans.Reading enjoyed some good attacking down the right-hand side of the pitch. On 24 minutes Sanne Troelsgaard passed to Emma Harries whose right-foot cross was aimed for Lauren Wade at the near post, but was cleared by England international Millie Bright to safety.After some promising play, Reading found themselves 2-0 down just before the half-hour mark. Tia Primmer lost the ball just outside the Reading penalty area, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd’s shot hitting the upright and rebounding back across the penalty area for Jelana Cankovic to react the quickest and side foot into the Reading goal from close range.Within minutes the Royals looked like they may be in trouble when Jelana Cankovic scored her second goal of the evening, nodding home a cross from Erin Cuthbert from the right and put the home side into a commanding 3-0 lead.Apart from a long-range left-foot strike by Justine Vanhaevermaet, after another run and cross from the right by Emma Harries, it was the home side on the ascendancy. The score line remained 3-0 at half-time after some heroic defending and blocks by Gemma Evans and Faye Bryson, and some brave goalkeeping by Jacqueline Burns who needed treatment after a dive and clash with her own team mate.Team: Burns, Bryson, Cooper, Evans, Woodham, Vanhaevermaet, Primmer, Eikeland, Troelsgaard, Wade, HarriesAfter the victory last week against Tottenham Hotspur, Kelly Chambers rewarded the players with an unchanged starting 11 and kept faith with the same team for the start of the second half.Within minutes of the restart Deanna Cooper picked up the Royals’ first playing staff yellow card after sticking out a right leg to stop the Chelsea striker running into the penalty area. Cooper was almost immediately back in the action, this time using her head to deflect a shot from Erin Cuthbert.It was an injury that saw Kelly Chambers make her first substitution of the evening with Rachel Rowe replacing Tia Primmer who hobbled off the pitch.On the hour mark Reading got a lifeline after a cross from Emma Harries, on the right, was cleared by Euros champion Mille Bright, only as far as Sanne Troelsgaard. The Danish international still had a lot to do but managed to side step and get an early shot on goal, past the Chelsea goal keeper, Ann-Katrin Berger, who will have been disappointed to see that go under her body. 3-1.Within 60 seconds it was jubilation as the Royals scored again with a great move and finish down the right-hand side of the pitch. Sanne Troelsgaard’s pass found Rachel Rowe who, in turn, quickly found Emma Harries with her cross perfectly pulled back to Amalie Eikeland who scored Reading’s second goal of the night. 3-2, game on!Faye Bryson picked up a yellow card shortly before being replaced by Reading’s club captain Emma Mukandi - Kelly Chambers presumably looking for experience to try and salvage something out of the match. The third change saw Lauren Wade swapped for Charlie Wellings as the Royals pushed for an equaliser and one that would have been well deserved.Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, can’t have imagined she would have found her team in this position with 15 minutes to go and had to resort to bringing on three substitutes including the formidable Sam Kerr and Guro Reiten.Although there were five minutes of time added on, Chelsea managed to see out the match and, to their relief, finish as 3-2 winners.It was another entertaining game another great comeback attempt by the Royals but, all too similarly, the effort was unrewarded. I’m sure though that Kelly Chambers will have more to say about that.Chelsea, although pleased by the money from Sky, will surely be disappointed by the crowd of only 1,184 (if I heard correctly). Perhaps not a surprise with a kick-off of 6.45pm on a school night, just before Christmas, with sub-zero temperatures and a pitch that resembled a Dickensian Christmas Carol scene (with the assistant referee playing the part of Scrooge…)* 21+ (19+ CA-ONT) (18+ NH/WY).
