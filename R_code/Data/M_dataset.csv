Brentford v Liverpool: Premier League – live,The Guardian,Barry Glendenning,2023-01-02,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jan/02/brentford-v-liverpool-premier-league-live-score-updates,"Brentford ran out more than worthy winners against their exalted but often abject opponents on what evolved into a very special night in West LondonJurgen Klopp: “It was a wild game and a game Brentford won so I’m not really sure you can control it all the time,” he tells Sky Sports. “Each corner was a massive threat. We knew before the game they’d be difficult to deal with and obviously they ‘stretch’ the rules in these moments. There’s full body contact and theres only one defensive foul off a set-piece tonight which was whistled against us, which is really funny. “Apart from that we conceded the first goal in a moment when we should already have been 2-0 up, with misses from Darwin and Kostas pretty much alone in front of the goal. Darwin doesn’t expect Mee to block there and Kostas should have been better with his shooting technique. But we get away with a goal from an offside position and then they score immediately and we are not there, so that’s a massive point for criticism.” Thomas Frank: “I can’t say that they’re surprising me massively but they keep impressing me,” says Thomas Frank of his players in an interview with Sky Sports. “It’s a fantastic result for us in many, many ways but to do what we were capable of doing here against Liverpool is very impressive.”Was he concerned about how his players would peform in the absence of Ivan Toney? ““It would be silly to say no,” he says. “Ivan is such a key player for us and has been fantastic in many ways.“If you ask me if I want to play him I’ll say ‘Yes, of course’. But we need more than 11 players and I’m so pleased that Wissa came in and scored. I think he’s our second top scorer in the Premier League over the last two seasons. He played fantastic.”Premier League: “This was a thudding reality check for anyone who thought Liverpool, having dusted themselves down over the winter break, would stroll back into the top four.” Nick Ames reports from the Gtech Community Stadium.A quick recap: Brentford went ahead courtesy of an Ibrahima Konate own goal in the first half and then had two Yoane Wissa goals disallowed for offside before the DR Congo international finally got his name on the scoresheet with a fine header. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp made three changes at half-time and his side roared out of the traps after the break. Darwin Nunez scored with a fine strike only to have his effort ruled out for offside, before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain got on the end of a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross to nod home and pull a goal back for Liverpool. They huffed and puffed but couldn’t force an equaliser before Brentford put the game beyond them courtesy of a Bryan Mbeumo strike on 84 minutes. An email: “Mbeumo beating Alisson may be the first time since Aboubakar headed past Ederson in the World Cup that a Cameroon international beat a Brazil international keeper to seal a surprise win,” writes Peter Oh. The Bees are buzzing: There’s a full on impromptu rave taking place on the pitch and in the stands, as the Brentford players and their sports start busting out moves to Gala’s Freed From Desire, which is belting out over the PA.No doubt the Fun Police will have something to say about such scenes of unbridled jubilation but that was hard fought win by Bus Stop in Hounslow FC and all involved have every right to enjoy it.How things stand: This win sends Brentford into seventh place in the table, just two points behind Liverpool, who stay in sixth after losing their fifth league game of the season. Their players and staff are milking the applause of the delighted home fans and it is well deserved. They were brilliant tonight. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeeep! It’s all over at the Gtech Community Stadium, where Brentford have run out extremely worthy winners against Liverpool. They were outstanding tonight against a Liverpool side who were little short of shambolic in the first half, but got their game faces on for the second. 90+6 min: Bryan Mbeumo is announced as man of the match and receives a warm embrace from Ivan Toney, who is sitting just behind the Brentford dug-out. In truth, any number of Brentford players would have been worthy winners of the gong. 90+5 min: Ben Mee hacks a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross into the Brentford penalty area upfield despite hearing a shout from David Raya. 90+4 min: Josh Dasilva plays the ball along the deck through the middle for Keane Lewis-Potter. Brentford get the ball into Liverpool’s penalty area again with Rico Henry delivering the cross but the ball ends up in the hands of Alisson. 90+1 min: Sergio Canos is on for Bryan Mbeumo and tries to latch on to a ball in behind from Keane Lewis-Potter. Andy Robertson stands firm, defends stoutly and shepherds the ball back to Alisson. That’s how you do it, Ibrahima. 89 min: That was Brentford’s first shot on goal of note in this second half and they dispatched it with aplomb and have presumably put the game beyond Liverpool. It’s been a superb performance from the Bees, both on the front and back foot. We’ll haver six added minutes. 86 min: Jurgen Klopp, Ibrahima Konate and the rest of Liverpool’s players are furious that Mbeumo’s goal wasn’t disallowed for what they saw as a foul on Konate in the build-up. Replays show their anger is misplaced and they are nothing short of delusional. There was no foul; Konate just wasn’t strong enough to hold off Mbeumo as they tussled for a 50-50 ball and simply fell over, leaving the Brentford striker with a clear path to goal.Brentford stretch their lead! Ibrahima Konate fails to deal with a long diagonal ball towards Mbeumo from Norgaard and goes to ground as the duo tussle for it. Mbeumo finds himself through on goal and slots the ball past Alisson.83 min: Liverpool substitution: Curtis Jones on for goalscorer Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Jones has previous when it comes to scoring at the Gtech Community Stadium, having scored a beauty in the corresponding fixture last year. 82 min: Into the final 10 minutes go with Brentford hanging on reasonably comfortably having weathered a Liverpool storm of sorts. 80 min: Liverpool win two corners in quick succession. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s delivery is met by Ibrahima Konate, whose downward header bounces in the six-yard box and goes wide of the far post. 78 min: Alisson sprints out of his area to sweep up a Janelt pass from deep under pressure from Mbeumo. There’s no time for any fancy stuff and he larrups the ball high up the pitch as hard as he can. 77 min: Josh Dasilva loses the ball, misplacing a pass and gifting possession to Fabinho halfway inside the Liverpool half. He sends Nunez in behind the Brentford defence with a quick, low through ball from deep but the Uruguayan is miles offside. 75 min: Mo Salah crosses low into the Brentford penalty area and Naby Keita’s touch tees up Trent Alexander-Arnold. Instead of shooting first time with the left foot we know he can use, he tries to shift the ball on to his favoured right. Brentford clear. 73 min: Darwin Nunez is booked for something or other, moments before Brentford make a double-substitution: Josh Dasilva and Keane Lewis-Potter come on for Matthias Jensen and Yoane Wissa, who have both played very well. 72 min: Liverpool win a corner. Andy Robertson’s delivery is headed clear by Ethan Pinnock. 71 min: With three Brentford players queuing up at the far post to meet a cross from the right, Trent Alexander-Arnold does very well to win the ball and clear. 69 min: Darwin Nunez pulls a low diagonal shot well wide of the far post after a poor touch by Norgaard gifted possession to Mo Salah and allowed him to play the Uruguayan in behind. 68 min: Brentford are sitting dangerously deep, inviting Liverpool on to them. It might be time for a Thomas Frank reshuffle and there appears to be activity on the subs bench behind him. 66 min: Salah and Keita combine on the edge of the Brentford penalty area and win their side a corner. Robertson’s inswinger is cleared at the near post by Norgaard, who hoofs the ball upfield unceremoniously. 64 min: Brentford remain in the lead but on the back foot with about half an hour to play. Liverpool are not looking quite as dangerous following their very intense start to the second half but the outcome of this game remains very much in the balance. 61 min: Naby Keita is penalised for a foul on Christian Norgaard, who is in no great rush to get back to his feet. 60 min: Thiago has a low drive from distance blocked. The ball breaks his way and his next shot is deflected out for a corner. Nothing comes of it although it takes Brentford an eternity to clear the ball. 58 min: Another ball into the box from Trent Alexander-Arnold sails too close to David Raya, who clutches it to his chest and drops to the ground. 57 min: Thiago gets booked for a cynical foul on Yoane Wissa. 55 min: There has been a significant improvement in Liverpool’s performance in this second half, due in no small part to the changes in personnel and the monumental bollocking they almost certainly got from their manager at half-time. 54 min: Brentford win another throw-in deep in Liverpool territory. With everyone expecting another long effort from Matthias Jensen, he plays it short and his side win a corner. The ball’s played to the far post, where Ben Mee heads it back across the face of goal. Liverpool clear their lines. 52 min: Trent Alexander-Arnold slings another cross into the Brentford penalty area, this time with his right foot. His delivery is too close to David Raya, who gathers with a minimum of fuss. Liverpool pull one back … again. Trent Alexander-Arnold moves the ball on to his left foot and whips the ball across the Brentford penalty area. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is on hand to steer the ball home with a header from seven yards. There was nothing wrong with that one.Brentford 2-0 Liverpool: VAR shows that Nunez was a mite offside as he ran on to that pass from Thiago and his splendid finish is chalked off. It’s still 2-0 and Brentford’s fans roar their approval. Liverpool pull a goal back! It’s a splendid finish from Darwin Nunez, who runs in behind the Brentford defence on to a Thiago pass from deep, but was he offside?46 min: Play resumes with the left side of the Liverpool defence replaced. The visitors immediately win a corner but nothing comes of it. Liverpool make three changes: Andrew Robertson, Joel Matip and Naby Keita are on for the second half. Virgil van Dijk, Kostas Tsimikas and Harvey Elliott are off. Big Virgil gets hooked at half-time? Oof. There’s a possibility he’s injured, of course … but he was truly dreadful in that first half. “Brentford isn’t just beating Liverpool, they are bossing them all over the pitch,” writes Mary Waltz. “While my Everton squad is in a relegation battle we just might lose, seeing the Reds getting slapped around is satisfying in an admittedly petty fashion.” “Liverpool were beyond lucky against Leicester with the spectacular Faes brace of own goals bringing them a scarcely deserved win,” writes Colum Fordham. “But Konate’s deflection shows own goals can come back to bite.”Peep! A mess at the back and offering very little up front short of one very presentable chance missed by Darwin Nunez, Liverpool trudge off for their half-time brew losing by two goals.An unwitting Ibrahima Konate opened the scoring for Brentford, allowing the ball to ricochet off his shin and past his own goalkeeper at a corner. Brentford’s Yoane Wissa had two further “goals” correctly ruled out for offside but was nothing if not persistent. Rather than let his head drop, he used it to steer the ball past Alisson to get a well deserved goal at the third time of asking.45+1 min: It was Matthias Jensen who turned provider for Brentford’s second goal. His cross to the far post was inch perfect for Wissa, who outjumped at least one defender to head home. Jurgen Klopp looks completely shell-shocked in his technical area. 44 min: Trailing 2-0 and extremely lucky to be only trailing by so few goals, Liverpool are an absolute shambles at the back. Their defence is all over the place and concede a second goal only 13 seconds after being granted a very fortunate reprieve. Brentford double their lead again and this one stands!!! Wissas finally gets one in his credit column at the third time of asking, heading home a cross from the right at the far post. It was a fine downward header that Alisson appeared to miraculously claw clear but technology informs the ref that the ball had crossed the line.How’s your luck, Yoane Wissa? The Brentford striker has another goal disallowed for an offside but on this occasion he wasn’t the culprit. But hang on!Brentford double their lead! It’s dreadful from Liverpool who concede from a corner again. Yoane Wissa fires home but it might be disallowed because his effort hit Ibrahima Konate and then Ben Mee, who was standing in an offside position, as it travelled into the goal.38 min: Rico Henry steals the ball from Trent Alexander-Arnold, who had been sold short by a dreadful pass from Tsimikas. Henry crosses the ball to the far post, where the Greek atones for his error by putting it out for a corner. 37 min: A poor clearance from Alisson almost results in an opportunity for Wissa. The flag goes up as he was coming back from an offside position as he tried to win the ball.35 min: Salah controls a pass from Fabinho and hooks a cross from the inside- right into the Brentford penalty area, trying to pick out Darwin Nunez on the edge of the six-yard box. Brentford clear comfortably. ","['It was a wild game and a game Brentford won so I’m not really sure you can control it all the time,', 'Each corner was a massive threat.

Premier League wants to introduce temporary concussion subs next season,The Guardian,Paul MacInnes,2022-12-21,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/21/premier-league-wants-to-introduce-temporary-concussion-subs-next-season,"The Premier League wants to adopt the use of temporary concussion substitutes in the competition next season in a departure from established thinking within the game on the risks of brain injury.The English top flight has written to the game’s international rule-making body, the International Football Association Board, asking to trial temporary substitutes from next summer. To date only permanent concussion substitutes have been tested in men’s football, despite vocal criticism from brain injury charities.The Premier League returns to competition on Boxing Day after a six-week break imposed by the winter World Cup. In preparing for the restart, the league revealed a raft of new disciplinary measures but said it was not prepared to imitate the Qatar tournament in adding on time to compensate for lengthy goal celebrations.One of the few top-flight competitions to have trialled concussion substitutes at all, the Premier League believes that permanent subs have had a positive impact, allowing medics greater time to make accurate assessments of head injuries. English football authorities have also defended permanent substitutes from criticism in the past, although the players’ union the PFA has always argued for temporary changes.But after consulting club doctors during the World Cup break an overwhelming consensus for using temporary substitutes has emerged. Doctors argue temporary subs would take pressure off decision-making by allowing tests to be conducted away from the field. If a player was ultimately found to have sustained concussion, the temporary substitute would then become permanent.The Premier League expects a response to a joint request, made alongside MLS in the USA and France’s Ligue 1, in the spring of 2023. It believes it will face opposition to any change both from other European leagues and Fifa.The brain injury association Headway welcomed the news. The charity has been a vocal supporter of temporary substitutes and criticised football’s slow adoption of tougher concussion protocols. On Wednesday its chief executive, Luke Griggs, said the change would be a “progressive development” in protecting players from brain injury.“Headway has repeatedly called for football to bring in temporary substitutes and, if this is confirmed, it will be warmly welcomed,” Griggs said. “The evolving nature of concussion means that a 10-minute off-pitch assessment will never be foolproof. But it will allow for medics more time to make better informed decisions, in the quiet confines of the dressing room, rather than snap judgments made on the pitch.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballAmong other measures announced before the restart, the Premier League said it would double down on trying to eliminate time-wasting from the game. It will urge match officials both to crack down on and add time for moments lost. But officials have decided they will not go as far as Fifa did in Qatar, for example adding on time for goal celebrations, despite their own statistics showing the ball was in play almost three minutes longer during World Cup group stage matches than it has been in the Premier League season to date (58 minutes to 55 minutes and 18 seconds). The League also said that Premier League managers and coaching staff have been reminded of expected standards of behaviour after a series of incidents in stadium technical areas before this season’s break.","['progressive development', 'Headway has repeatedly called for football to bring in temporary substitutes and, if this is confirmed, it will be warmly welcomed,', 'The evolving nature of concussion means that a 10-minute off-pitch assessment will never be foolproof.

Crystal Palace v Tottenham: Premier League – live,The Guardian,Will Unwin,2023-01-04,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jan/04/crystal-palace-tottenham-premier-league-live,"A Harry Kane double helps leads Spurs to a dominant victory over Crystal PalaceThank you very much for joining me. Here is Jacob Steinberg’s report from Selhurst Park.Antonio Conte: “It was a good reaction. It is not easy to win against Palace away. After the first half it was in the balance. In the second half we exploited chances to score.“The message [at half time] was to continue to play because we started the game very well. In the second half of the first half we struggled because we lost possession. “I think we played a good game. We tried to press high and recover good ball. Son finally scored, it was really good for him because he needs confidence in himself. We didn’t concede a goal after a long time of not doing that. In this period we are playing with many young players. I had the opportunity during the World Cup to work with these young players to improve them tactically and physically.“This team always shows a great character. They know very well I hate to lose.”The lovely Ben Fisher was at Villa Park. Here is his report.Louise Taylor saw Leeds draw with West Ham.Harry Kane: “A really important result. It was a tough game away from home, so was nice to put that performance in.“They had a spell from 35 mins where they played well. It was about moving the ball quickly and waiting for the boys in the final third to do something.“These are the games that if you go 1-0 behind, you can find it difficult. We scored at a good time. The games are coming thick and fast, so it is a good game to win.“I am one of those: if you think too much, it can have the opposite effect. It was nice to get a couple today.”Son: “In the second half we turned things around and scored four goals. We dominated the half. The lads really deserve it.“I feel sorry for the team because they are expecting me to do more than I have done. I hope it is a turning point.“The goal is always important to get the confidence back. It was really, really important for me.”Not bad.300 – Harry Kane is just the second Premier League player to score on his 100th, 200th and 300th appearance in the competition after Teddy Sheringham. Milestones. pic.twitter.com/5Bj1U5R6SkThe full-time whistle blows at Villa Park where the hosts have drawn with Wolves. Bryan Gil had a great game for Spurs. It was only his second Premier League start for the club and his first against Aston Villa produced a relatively anonymous display. Son found the net and looked more confident for the rest of the match. Will this be a turning point for Spurs?Ed Aarons saw Nottingham Forest defeat Southampton. Here is his report.What a cracking second half from Spurs, after a relatively poor opening 45 minutes. Kane came up with two impressive finishes but was great in his all-round play for Conte’s side. Palace fell off a cliff at half time. They lack consistency and that really needs to be addressed. 90 mins: Three minutes added on.88 mins: Kane is given man of the match by Alan Smith on Sky and we can all see why. Elsewhere: FT Leeds 2-2 West Ham86 mins: Palace whip in another corner but it is easily cleared. Doucoure shoots from 30 yards – it goes nowhere near the net.White comes on for his Premier League debut. Davies is also on. Perisic and Lenglet off. 84 mins: Kane spins Guehi in the box but Andersen bails out his teammate with a clearance before the striker can shoot. Guehi has been pretty dreadful tonight. Poor chap. 82 mins: Nice work between Zaha and Mateta inside the box concludes with a shot from eight yards out from the winger but it is straight at Lloris.Elsewhere: Aston Villa 1-1 Wolves (Ings)80 mins: The ball reaches Ayew around 20 yards out, he takes a touch to get it out of his feet and thwacks a drive across Lloris who does really well to tip it behind at full stretch. 78 mins: Gil pulls back a Palace player to earn a booking and is immediately subbed off. He gets a big hug from Conte. Sessegnon and Emerson Royal are on. Doherty the other man to be replaced. 76 mins: I am not sure anyone predicted this at half time. Palace have really rolled over with incredible ineptness. 74 mins: Palace bring on Edouard and Hughes. I am not sure it will help.72 mins: GOAL! Kane dinks a ball over the top for Son; Guehi completely fails to deal with it and it bounces up for Son to hit. The ball ends up in the bottom corner, via a deflection off Guehi to make this a fine night for Spurs.Done and dusted.72 mins: Zaha takes Lloris by surprise with a early shot from the edge of the box but it drifts wide of the goal. Kári Tulinius emails: “After tonight’s win, Forest are currently up to 15th, I think. They played well and fully deserved all three points. Considering how incoherent the team was after the trolley dash at the beginning of the season, this has to go down as an incredible feat of management by Steve Cooper.”70 mins: Kane chips the ball to Doherty in space on the edge of the box, he looks to double his account but his shot is blocked. Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest beat Southampton, who sounded absolutely dreadful. 68 mins: GOAL! Kane produces some fine work on the left, cuts inside and lays it to Son to shoot, the Korean takes it wide so has to pull it back to Doherty, via a deflection, to sweep home.Game over.67 mins: The corner is cleared to the edge of the box, where Eze is waiting to head it back into the danger area but Mateta gets underneath it and heads over. Down the other end, Kane takes a great touch and turns to play in Son; he gets through one-on-one but hits it straight at Guaita. The flag goes up regardless. 65 mins: Zaha is tackled by Doherty. The winger wants a free-kick but Oliver rightly awards a corner. Sarr is set to come on for only his second Premier League appearance for Spurs.63 mins: Doucoure jabs a pass to Olise 20 yards from goal; the winger lines up a first-time shot but it curls just wide.Mateta has gone up top alongside Ayew and Eze has dropped deeper into central midfield.Elsewhere: Leeds 2-2 West Ham (Rodrigo) 61 mins: Schlupp goes in the book for whacking Gil over. Very much a '“robust challenge”. The midfielder is immediately replaced by Mateta. Spurs fans have a chant for Bryan Gil. That’s nice.59 mins: The two goals have, understandably, quietened Selhurst Park. All seems a bit flat. I think the fans need to see some spark on the pitch to get them going again. 57 mins: Vieira’s calls for consistency are not being heeded, which is a shame. There is plenty of talent in this Palace side but they can barely put two decent halves together, let alone two matches. 55 mins: Spurs came out very early for the second half, I assume after a Conte rocket up the proverbial. It seems to have done the trick. That and having a world class striker available. 53 mins: GOAL! Gil sends the ball through the eye of the needle to Kane in the box, he takes a touch to set himself and fires the ball into the corner across Guaita. He is only a couple away from Jimmy Greaves’ goalscoring record.A wonderful finish across the goalkeeper. 52 mins: Perisic launches a long throw into the box but it is easily headed clear. Olise clips Lenglet’s heels and before the referee can blow, the defender grabs the ball, forcing Michael Oliver to give Spurs a free-kick. Ayew bundles his way through three or four defenders and lays the ball off to Doucoure on the edge of the box but his shot is dreadful and heads up in the stand.50 mins: Doucoure is late on Hojbjerg, leaving the Dane on the deck. He soon gets up to hobble away.48 mins: GOAL! Gil does well to take the ball across the box before laying it to Perisic on the left from where he dinks a cross to the back post for Kane to head home on his 300 the Premier League appearance. Kane heads Spurs into the lead. 47 mins: A positive start from Palace as they launch a ball upfield which Romero fails to control, allowing Ayew to nip in but Dier gets back in time to block his shot.The resulting corner goes out to Doucoure on the edge of the box, he slides the ball to Ward to whack at goal. His shot bounces off an arm but is is not a penalty. Here we go again!Rob Hine is not a fan: “This is a bit like watching Yeovil vs AFC Fylde back in the day. “You don’t expect a lot and you’re not disappointed when nothing happens. “But that was the National League, this is supposed to be the Premier League.”West Ham are 2-1 up thanks to Scamacca.Peter Oh emails: “It looks like Crystal Palace’s French-English midfielder has been lively. Beethoven fans among the home support might want to work on a chant called Für Olise.”“What does Mary Waltz think about the floated Moyes return to Everton?” asks Joe Pearson. “I think most Evertonians would welcome him back as a hero. But what do I know? I support the team on the other side of Stanley Park.”Tottenham started quite brightly but have been very ordinary in the final third. They look like a team short of confidence and ideas. Palace really picked things up from the half-hour make onwards and had the best chance of the half. Overall: not a classic.45 mins: One minute added on. Romero currently on the deck holding his face to give the impression he’s been punched in the face by Ayew. He was not.44 mins: Romero decides he needs to show why he is a World Cup winner by playing a quarterback-esque pass over the top. Sadly, it goes nowhere near a teammate and Guaita calmly collects. 42 mins: Ayew is rolling around in his own half after a late tackle from behind, which Skipp is booked for. Skipp is not having his best game currently, I think it is fair to say.40 mins: Eze latches onto a bouncing ball inside the box but goes down with Skipp in the vicinity. There is a brief claim for a penalty but VAR shakes its big electronic head almost immediately. I think he slipped. 38 mins: Olise’s latest corner comes off Andersen’s back/shoulder and is easily claimed by Lloris. Down the other end, Son looks to curl a cross into the box from the left but instead he lifts is straight into the stand behind the goal. 36 mins: Eze is pulled back by Skipp but play is waved on and Palace win a corner. Skipp somehow avoids a booking.Leeds 1-1 West Ham34 mins: Palace are now on top. Spurs are struggling to get the ball out of their half and the Palace forward four are looking more confident. Olise drives into the box and takes aim for the bottom corner but a Spurs boot deflects the ball wide. 32 mins: Centre-back Andersen is waiting 35 yards out when the ball lands at his feet, he takes a few touches and lets fly, only to see it drift a millimetre or two wide with Lloris diving despairingly.30 mins: Doherty feels the need to turn a cross behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it on the right. It gets half cleared three or four times but comes back through a Schlupp cross which Lenglet is there flicks away for another corner. Our man at Southampton.Southampton booed off at half-time after a dismal display. Forest deservedly ahead","['It was a good reaction. It is not easy to win against Palace away.

Assistant referee Bhupinder Singh Gill to make Premier League history,The Guardian,Paul MacInnes,2023-01-04,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/assistant-referee-bhupinder-singh-gill-to-make-premier-league-history,"Bhupinder Singh Gill says he hopes to “inspire the next generation” as he prepares to become the first Sikh-Punjabi to serve as an assistant referee at a Premier League match.The 37-year-old, who qualified as a referee at the age of 14, will run the line when Southampton host Nottingham Forest on Wednesday, a groundbreaking achievement. “This has to be the proudest and most exciting moment in my refereeing journey, but I’m not getting carried away as it is just another step in the direction to where I want to get to,” said Singh Gill, known as Bhups.“Hopefully, this is another moment to help inspire the next generation to sign up to a refereeing course and get into officiating. My dream has always been to reach the top of the game, be a role model for future officials and encourage more people from diverse backgrounds into officiating, especially from a South Asian background just like me.”Howard Webb, the chief refereeing officer of Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, said Singh Gill had proven himself as a talented official in the EFL.“I’m delighted that Bhupinder has been given this appointment in the Premier League – for him as an individual, and for the recognition of the talented and dedicated official he is, having worked his way through the levels,” Webb said.“Bhupinder’s appointment to the Premier League and the best league in the world will show an even greater audience about what’s possible for people from different backgrounds. It will give other British [South] Asian boys and girls an opportunity to see somebody who looks like them doing something that they thought wasn’t possible for them previously.”Webb told Sky Sports News. “It’s a great opportunity to use Bhupinder’s expertise in the capacity as a role model, but also for us to have his ability as an official – because he’s good at what he does.”Bhupinder’s brother, Sunny, is the highest-ranked referee of South Asian heritage in England and joined the EFL referees’ list this summer. Bhupinder made history alongside Sunny in 2021 when the pair worked on the same Championship fixture. Bhupinder was an assistant referee and Sunny the fourth official when Bristol City hosted Nottingham Forest.They are the sons of the trailblazing referee Jarnail Singh, who took charge of 150 EFL games between 2004 and 2010.

Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action,The Guardian,Guardian sport,2023-01-02,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/02/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action,"Moyes’s time is running out, Rashford gives no cause for alarm and Arsenal’s creative genius continues to shineIf Erling Haaland is the Premier League’s goal machine then its creative genius may well be, with apologies to Kevin De Bruyne, Martin Ødegaard. Come the season’s end, two Norwegians could be competing for individual honours. Placing the captaincy with an artistic playmaker is not usual practice in English football but Mikel Arteta has instead followed the orthodoxy of giving the armband to the team’s best, most important player. At Brighton it was Ødegaard who made the difference against an opponent refusing to be flushed out. His goal may have been a miskick but his pass for Gabriel Martinelli to score Arsenal’s fourth was a beauty. The one-time boy wonder who lost his way at Real Madrid will not be going the same way as previous youthful burnouts like Nii Lamptey, Javier Saviola or Francis Jeffers. At 24, Ødegaard is Arsenal’s jewel. John BrewinMatch report: Brighton 2-4 ArsenalSomething refreshing happened on Saturday at Molineux. Marcus Rashford’s omission from the starting lineup for what Erik ten Hag described as “internal disciplinary” reasons was the subject of much intrigue but afterwards Rashford, with Ten Hag’s blessing, was permitted to clarify events. Rashford told broadcasters in post-match interviews that he fell foul of Ten Hag’s rules by arriving late for a team meeting after oversleeping. Rather than keeping Rashford off-limits and allowing rumours to grow legs, United and Rashford nipped the episode, which he was even able to raise a smile about, firmly in the bud. Of course, it helped that Rashford scored to earn an eighth victory in nine games, as well as the man-of-the-match award. Some things should stay confidential or in-house but credit to Ten Hag and United for allowing everyone to be grownup. Ben FisherMatch report: Wolves 0-1 Manchester UnitedHaving excluded Phil Foden for Saturday’s draw with Everton to make it only one start in six Premier League games for the forward, Pep Guardiola explained why. “Phil can play in one thousand positions,” he said. “[But] I see something on the pitch, in the training sessions, and I use my intuition to use Jack [Grealish] in these games because he gives us extra passes. Phil is better when we play more vertical. Both can play together and combine. Always, top players are not playing. Lately, as I get older, I mainly look at the body language – in the training sessions and everything. You cannot play good when the body language is not correct. Sometimes you choose the players for how happy they are, if they are there. That is one of the main decisions with choosing the lineup, because with the skills, I know how good they are. The body language depends on them and sometimes they are not good and it is more difficult.” Jamie JacksonMatch report: Manchester City 1-1 EvertonCould Antonio Conte be out of a job before spring? The suggestion would have seemed outlandish a couple of months ago, when a 2-0 win over Everton made it 23 points from Tottenham’s opening 10 league games, the club’s best start to a season since the 60s. But that was then. The seven games since have thrown up four defeats, the performances every bit as bad as the results. Form may be temporary but class was nowhere to be seen during Sunday’s insipid loss to Aston Villa and a lusty chorus boos at the final whistle never bodes well for a manager’s job prospects. After Wednesday’s clash with Crystal Palace, Spurs’ next four league games include the visit of Arsenal and two meetings with Manchester City. Spurs could end that run of games without a manager or with their title credentials restored. But either way, this week’s trip to Selhurst Park now looks very important indeed. Alex HessMatch report: Tottenham 0-2 Aston VillaSteve Cooper has spent 17 games trying to stitch together his best XI and might finally have found it. The back four and central midfield trio have made the team more settled in recent matches and considerably harder to break down. The remaining area to sort out was the front three, unsurprising for a team that has scored 12 goals all season. In the first half they did not particularly trouble Chelsea but after the break Taiwo Awoniyi played more centrally, causing problems for the centre-backs. Morgan Gibbs-White was getting on the ball more often to open up their opponents and Brennan Johnson threatened in behind with his pace. Awoniyi and Johnson looked dangerous in the Carabao Cup win over Blackburn and Gibbs-White has kept improving since his summer arrival. Cooper would be well-advised to stick with this team even when Jesse Lingard returns. Will UnwinMatch report: Nottingham Forest 1-1 ChelseaTwo defeats in two games has a worrying echo for Brendan Rodgers, who saw his Leicester team open the season with one point from seven matches after a summer of transfer inactivity. The restart, however, has not brought fears of a repeat for the Leicester manager even with Patson Daka joining a significant injury list also featuring James Maddison and Jonny Evans. The visitors were vastly improved from their Boxing Day defeat by Newcastle and denied a tangible reward at Anfield only by two calamitous interventions from Wout Faes. The Belgium defender is the one player Leicester have paid to bring in this season but Rodgers predicted there will be more to come in January. “I think there will be a little bit of money to spend in the areas we want to improve, so we feel we can do that,” he said. “It is not all about money but if you stand still others will overtake you.” Andy HunterMatch report: Liverpool 2-1 LeicesterSign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballWest Ham’s blip has become a slump. Their league form was wretched during the second half of last season and they have already given David Moyes a chance at a reset after handing him £160m to spend last summer. Little has changed. Gianluca Scamacca, Thilo Kehrer and Lucas Paquetá have underwhelmed and West Ham, who are caught between trying to become a possession team and move away from a counterattacking style, are deep in relegation trouble. Defeat to Brentford was hugely concerning. Moyes tried to alter his tactics, moving Paquetá into a deeper midfield role, but it did not work and the board’s reluctance to make a managerial change is a risk. Yes, Moyes has credit in the bank, but that is close to emptying out after five consecutive defeats. West Ham need to start looking at possible replacements. Jacob SteinbergMatch report: West Ham 0-2 BrentfordA point gained for Leeds, two dropped by Newcastle. Played amid torrential rain, Saturday’s goalless draw was a reminder that Eddie Howe’s impressive side remain mortal, while Jesse Marsch’s team are showing signs of much-needed defensive improvement. More significant litmus tests lie in wait this week, with Newcastle’s Champions League credentials set to be scrutinised during Tuesday’s trip to Arsenal and Leeds hosting a classic relegation six-pointer against struggling West Ham. David Moyes’s players can only hope Illan Meslier, Marsch’s outstanding goalkeeper, is not in the sort of inspired form he displayed on Tyneside. Whatever happens against the Premier League leaders, Howe should be applauded for his transformative coaching. Newcastle head into 2023 having suffered only one defeat – narrowly and contentiously at Liverpool – all season. Louise TaylorMatch report: Newcastle 0-0 LeedsThere were few positives for the watching new Bournemouth owners at the Vitality Stadium as their team limped to defeat against Crystal Palace. Philip Billing managed 38 underwhelming minutes before being replaced by Siriki Dembélé. The substitute was a bright spark for the Cherries and gave enough evidence to show he deserves more time on the pitch in the coming weeks, especially with a hectic January schedule ahead. Lively from the moment he came on, he was one of the few Bournemouth players to put Vicente Guaita through any work. He almost left the club in the summer but has worked hard under Gary O’Neil to get back in favour. Bill Foley and Michael B Jordan will be eager to make new additions to the squad this month but they might also be aware of the quality at their disposal. Certain players need a little more time to blossom in the Premier League. Will UnwinMatch report: Bournemouth 0-2 Crystal PalaceWhere would Southampton be without James Ward-Prowse? The England midfielder was inspirational for Nathan Jones’s side as they recovered from his first-half own goal and looked on course for a point after yet another brilliant free-kick – his 15th in the Premier League – until João Palhinha’s late winner for Fulham. While the likes of Samuel Edozie and Mohamed Elyounoussi showed glimpses of their talent, Jones refused to accept the suggestion Southampton have relied too much on their captain this season as they prepare to face Nottingham Forest in a bottom-of-the-table showdown on Wednesday. “I think it’s disrespectful to say he is carrying the team,” said Jones. “He’s a big player for us because of the quality he has but there are a lot of players working hard out there. It’s just we need a little bit more knowhow and we need a little bit more discipline in certain elements of our play.” Ed AaronsMatch report: Fulham 2-1 Southampton","['internal disciplinary', 'Phil can play in one thousand positions,', '[But] I see something on the pitch, in the training sessions, and I use my intuition to use Jack [Grealish] in these games because he gives us extra passes.

January transfer window: what are Premier League clubs hoping for?,The Guardian,Guardian sport,2022-12-31,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/31/january-transfer-window-what-are-premier-league-clubs-hoping-for,"From Roberto De Zerbi’s first transfer window at Brighton to limited funds at Manchester United, a roundup of who is likely to go whereThe loss of Gabriel Jesus for up to three months has intensified Arsenal’s search for reinforcements, with Shakhtar Donetsk’s Mykhaylo Mudryk at the top of Mikel Arteta’s January shopping list. But having failed with their initial bid of £55m, Arsenal know they will have to pay much more to secure the 21-year-old and could turn to Atletico Madrid’s João Félix as an alternative. Ed AaronsUnai Emery wants to supplement his attacking options. Ollie Watkins has impressed in patches but Villa want more competition up front. A reunion with wingers Arnaut Danjuma and Nicolas Jackson, both of whom Emery worked with at Villarreal, has been mooted, while Félix has been offered to numerous Premier League clubs on loan. Villa would be open to offloading Frédéric Guilbert, Morgan Sanson and Marvelous Nakamba, all of whom appear surplus to requirements. Ben FisherBournemouth mean business. Bill Foley, their new 78-year-old American billionaire owner, plans to back Gary O’Neil with at least four new faces in their fight for survival. Foley has acknowledged his aggressive approach might upset others. “I’m not here to make friends,” he said. Bournemouth have dipped into the Championship in the past to pluck talents, including now captain Lloyd Kelly (from Bristol City) and winger Marcus Tavernier (from Middlesbrough), arguably their best performer this season. BFThe uncertainty over Ivan Toney’s short-term future, with 262 alleged betting breaches hanging over him, could see Brentford enter the market for a striker out of fear their top scorer will be banned. Brentford are loath to spend heavily in January; in the last winter window they signed Christian Eriksen on a free and Jonas Lössl on loan. They were willing to break their transfer record in the summer to sign Mudryk for £30m but he seems out of reach now. Will UnwinRoberto De Zerbi’s first transfer window on the south coast may not be as busy as the Italian might hope but Brighton will be eager to show their support after he took over from Graham Potter in September. The Ukraine defender Mykola Matviyenko from De Zerbi’s former club Shakhtar is among those to have been linked, while he will also be desperate to hang on to Alexis Mac Allister – who signed a new contract until 2025 with an option to extend it by a year before the World Cup – after his performances for Argentina in Qatar. EAAfter splashing out a record £272m in the summer, Chelsea’s spending spree under their new owners looks set to continue into January. The Ivory Coast forward David Datro Fofana is already on his way from Molde with Benoît Badiashile likely to join him from Monaco, although the expected arrival of Josko Gvardiol may not be so straightforward after Real Madrid entered the race for the Croatian. Chelsea are also reported to have opened talks with Benfica over a move for the Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernández, who has a £105m release clause. EACo-chairman Steve Parish’s admission that Palace are targeting “probably more loans than buys” will not be music to the ears of Patrick Vieira or supporters. The manager’s concerns over a lack of depth in midfield – not to mention Wilfried Zaha entering the last six months of his contract – could lead to a frenzied final few days at the end of the month at a club that has signed a new striker in every January transfer window since 2018. EAAnother relegation battle looms at Goodison Park and the outcome may rest on the club’s success, or otherwise, in landing the forward options Frank Lampard desperately needs. His job could depend on it too. Mohammed Kudus has been a target since the summer but Ajax would not sell then and his stock has since risen. Quality and quantity is vital, with summer recruits Neal Maupay and Dwight McNeil never likely to fill the Richarlison void. Andy HunterThanks to a fine start to the season, there is no need to panic at Craven Cottage. Sitting comfortably in mid-table, they can plot some longer term signings to strengthen Marco Silva’s squad. Right-back is one area of concern which the club would like to address, while another central midfielder is on the wishlist and they will be optimistic they can bring in suitable candidates. WUMoney is believed to be tight at Elland Road and, in any case, Victor Orta, the director of football, never seems keen on trading in January. Jesse Marsch does though have a pressing need for a left-back where Pascal Struijk has been filling in out of position while Junior Firpo has struggled for form and fitness. Philadelphia Union’s 25-year-old German full-back Kai Wagner has been under serious consideration for some time and could be a decent acquisition. Salzburg’s Austria international Maximilian Wöber, recently converted to the left from centre-half, is another possibility. With Patrick Bamford struggling to return to optimal fitness another central striker would also be useful. Southampton’s Scotland forward Che Adams ranks among the potential options. Louise TaylorBrendan Rodgers has not made a permanent signing in January since taking charge of Leicester in 2019 but the Northern Irishman is confident that is about to change. Leicester’s owners are willing to fund the arrival of a winger, left-back and centre-back in the window. Rodgers is targeting more stature and physicality, with power and speed at the forefront of his thinking. They could revive a move for the former Chelsea winger Jérémie Boga and the former Leicester loanee Michael Keane has also been linked. BFSign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballJürgen Klopp has already revealed his hand with the signing of Netherlands’ World Cup star Cody Gakpo for an initial £35m from PSV Eindhoven. Liverpool had eyed a move for the forward next summer but with rivals circling, plus Luis Díaz and Diogo Jota out until March, plans were brought forward. There remains time to add a midfield reinforcement although top target Jude Bellingham is unlikely to be available until the summer. AHErik ten Hag desperately requires a prolific goalscorer but severely limited funds meant he missed out on Gakpo. Instead a cut-price loan deal is the most likely so with a close-to-no-chance of a revival of the summer interest in Bologna’s Marko Arnautovic, might a move be made, say, for Bayern Munich’s Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting who is out of contract in the summer? Jamie JacksonPep Guardiola has all but ruled out any business but he did the same regarding signing a new contract during the World Cup (when this writer asked him) so never say never, especially after Manuel Akanji was a surprise buy in the summer window. The manager is reportedly a fan of Josko Gvardiol yet purchasing the €90m-valued Leipzig defender would seem more likely in the close season. JJEddie Howe says it would take “serious money” to improve the quality of his first XI and that financial fair play restrictions dictate such funds may not be available this January. Assuming Newcastle have a little more room for manoeuvre than the manager claims, his top targets are a wide forward with Borussia Mönchengladbach’s Marcus Thuram high on a wishlist also including Leeds’s Jack Harrison. In an ideal world Howe would also augment his midfield with Leicester’s James Maddison but, for assorted reasons, that deal may need to wait for the summer. He also covets Benfica’s Argentina midfielder Fernández but fears the transfer fee would be of skyscraper proportions. Perhaps more realistically, West Ham’s Harrison Ashby could be signed as cover for Kieran Trippier at right-back. LTThings will be a lot calmer at the City Ground in January compared to their summer of signing 23 players. Key positions are earmarked for reinforcements down the spine of the team: central defence, central midfield and a forward. As previously proven, the Forest owners are not afraid of paying up for players, so additions are a guarantee. WUIt is less than six months but it feels like a lifetime since Southampton were trying for Gakpo and Gonçalo Ramos. Those ships have of course sailed. Southampton’s failure to sign a striker in the summer has left them at risk of relegationbut the Saints need to improve at both ends. Previously they have been happy to nurture strikers brought up from the Championship, including Che Adams and Adam Armstrong, but regardless Nathan Jones’s team are short of firepower. BFAntonio Conte is never one to rest on his laurels and Tottenham’s shaky form means the Italian is on the hunt for new faces once again. Having enjoyed success in the form of last year’s mid-season arrivals Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur, Conte is reported to have set his sights on Sporting Lisbon defender Pedro Porro, France midfielder Adrien Rabiot and Morocco’s midfield destroyer Sofyan Amrabat. EAThere was heavy investment in the summer so David Moyes could accept those signings need time to settle and could peak in the second half of the campaign. Twenty-year-old defender Luizão has already been acquired from São Paulo but he will start life in the club’s under-21 team. A senior centre-back would be a target if Craig Dawson leaves. WUWolves recognise this window can help them play catchup and Julen Lopetegui has been promised funds to revamp a flailing squad that has spent almost the entire season in the relegation zone. The Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha is expected to be the first of at least four new faces through the door. Wolves are also targeting a right-back, centre-back and possibly another striker in addition to Cunha. It remains to be seen if the club renews its interest in the West Ham defender Craig Dawson.

Too early to say what caused Hamlin's cardiac arrest - medical experts - Reuters,Reuters,,2023-01-05,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/too-early-say-what-caused-hamlins-cardiac-arrest-medical-experts-2023-01-05/,"Jan 3 (Reuters) - (This Jan. 3 story has been refiled to say Meagan Wasfy works at Mass General Brigham in paragraph 9)The National Football League (NFL) and medical experts have moved to quell rampant speculation over what caused Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin to go into cardiac arrest during Monday night's football game in Cincinnati.After making a routine tackle in the first quarter, the 24-year-old rose to his feet, then collapsed on his back as his body went limp. Hamlin received CPR on the field as players from both teams and millions of television viewers watched in horror.The Bills on Wednesday said Hamlin had shown ""signs of improvement"" but remained in critical condition at University of Cincinnati Medical Center.  read more With scarce information to go on, devoted fans scoured television news and online forums for any clue as to what may have prompted this unprecedented incident in the United States' most popular pro sport.Medical professionals not directly involved in the case have floated possible causes for what caused Hamlin's heart to stop, including commotio cordis, a very rare occurrence in which blunt force trauma to the chest can cause an arrhythmia.But the NFL's chief medical officer, Allen Sills, told reporters on Wednesday that there was ""still a lot of investigation that needs to happen"" to understand Hamlin's case.""Many people have discussed this condition commotio cordis, and it certainly is possible,"" Sills said. ""But I think what's more important is, regardless of the cause, the key of any type of sudden cardiac event is the rapid response of trained personnel.""He added that the incident showed a need for ""every sport, at every level"" to prepare for sudden cardiac events.Meagan Wasfy, a sports cardiologist at Mass General Brigham, told Reuters that speculating about what caused the cardiac arrest was not helpful and ""could have more negative consequences than positive ones.""Wasfy was one of seven members of the American College of Cardiology who put out a statement on Wednesday warning medical professionals and others against making armchair diagnoses.""Reckless speculation on social media is a source of disinformation and could lead to other unintended negative consequences,"" the physicians said. ""We would encourage all to avoid this practice and allow the medical evaluation to proceed by those in charge.""Wasfy said quickly treating someone experiencing cardiac arrest was ""absolutely crucial.""""We know that the time between the sudden cardiac arrest and initiation of CPR and defibrillation is what helps determine the outcomes, first of all whether the life is saved or not in the moment and then how the individual does after,"" she said.It is far too soon to say when or whether Hamlin, in his second year in the league, would play again, though he is not the first athlete to suffer cardiac arrest during a game.  read more National Hockey League defenseman Chris Pronger, who collected two Olympic gold medals for Canada, collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest when a slap shot hit him in the chest at the 1998 Stanley Cup playoffs.He was able to continue his career, playing for more than a decade after recovering from the incident. On Tuesday, he tweeted his well wishes for Hamlin.Former Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba was retired at 24 after collapsing on the pitch in an FA Cup match in 2012 and being technically ""dead"" for 78 minutes.He was saved in part by the intervention of an off-duty heart specialist in the crowd who used a defibrillator to revive Muamba's heart, leading to a campaign to have more of the emergency devices at sports clubs and public places.Christian Eriksen returned to the Premier League in January last year after his cardiac arrest on the pitch at the European Championship in 2021.The Denmark international has been fitted with a heart-starting device known as an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD).Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Thomson ReutersLos Angeles-based sports reporter who interviews the most impactful athletes and executives in the world.

The Premier League returns … do we all remember what was going on? | Barry Glendenning,The Guardian,Barry Glendenning,2022-12-23,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/dec/23/the-premier-league-returns-do-we-all-remember-what-was-going-on-arsenal-newcastle-everton,"A six-week World Cup break has been rather odd but it seems Arsenal are top, Newcastle third and Everton are still in crisisThis season’s Premier League. Remember it? It kicked off back in August before taking a six-week hiatus so we could all enjoy the first ever winter World Cup. Well, it’s back on Boxing Day, so now seems as good as time as any to provide a quick primer for readers who, like this column, may have been so preoccupied by events in Doha they’ve been being paying scant attention to goings on closer to home.Consider it born out of our surprise upon discovering that Liverpool winger Luis Díaz could be out for the rest of the season with the recurrence of a knee injury his manager Jürgen Klopp has described as a “proper smash in the face”. Or knee, presumably.Liverpool have also been unsettled by the revelation their sporting director Julian Ward has announced he will be leaving the club at the end of the season, just a year after taking up the job. More a kick in the nuts than a smash in the face, the announcement comes at a time when the club owners Fenway Sports Group are considering a sale of their cash cow.And while we say mid-season, it isn’t really because all 20 teams have only played up to 15 games. Arsenal remain the unlikely league leaders even though nobody, least of all their own fans, seems prepared to even remotely entertain the notion they might actually win it. Despite their exalted position and five-point lead over Manchester City, it is Pep Guardiola’s reigning champions who remain red-hot favourites to retain their title.Just two points behind them in third, Newcastle are looking an increasingly less preposterous bet to “do a Leicester” at outlandishly generous odds. Having said that, Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has been plugged into the mains for six weeks and is fully recharged, although his industrious but considerably less prolific Arsenal counterpart Gabriel Jesus has been ruled out for three months.It’s all change at Bournemouth, whose protracted takeover by elderly Las Vegas billionaire Bill Foley has finally been ratified by the Premier League. The American’s first order of business was to make Gary O’Neil’s role as caretaker manager permanent, despite reported talks with Marcelo Bielsa about the position. Foley’s takeover means that more than half of the Premier League’s clubs now have minority or majority American shareholders, many of whom remain decidedly unpopular with fans, some of whom would prefer new sugar daddies from the Middle East.Elsewhere on the south coast, less forgetful readers may remember that Southampton have finally sacked Ralph Hasenhüttl, in a state of affairs that will come as good news of for those of us who can never remember if it’s ‘Hasenhüttl” with one ‘s’ or two. His highly regarded replacement, Nathan Jones, won just six out of 38 games the last time he left Luton Town and Saints fans will be desperate for a better return now that Jones has departed Kenilworth Road for a second time.At the third time of asking, Wolves have finally appointed Julen Lopetegui, who got off to a winning start in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday and will take charge of his first league match on Boxing Day. The Premier League’s bottom side travel to play Everton-in-freefall, who have lost five of their past seven games.The favourite to be next top flight manager out of a job, Frank Lampard could do with a result at Goodison Park, not least because Everton travel to Manchester City on New Year’s Eve. Back-to-back defeats could spell the end for “Lamps” before Everton fans settle down in front of Jools Holland’s Hootenanny to ring in 2023, a year in which they will be hoping for more than the nine league wins they’ve racked up so far in the past 12 months.Meanwhile at Chelsea, there are already faint murmurs of discontent regarding Graham Potter, despite his managerial tenure at the club being just 14 games old. Having poached his former club’s entire coaching staff and head of recruitment, the former Brighton manager saw his side embarrassed upon his return to the Amex Stadium in late October. He has since overseen consecutive league defeats against Arsenal and Newcastle that leave Chelsea an unacceptable eighth in the table.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballHaving missed 11 months of last year with a knee injury, the luckless Leicester City defender James Justin will almost certainly sit out the rest of this campaign after rupturing his achilles. After being restricted to just one league appearance for West Ham before Qatar 2022, Nayef Aguerd is once again an injury doubt for his team’s trip to Arsenal on Boxing Day. On the plus side, at least West Ham fans recently got to see how good he is even if it was while playing for Morocco in Qatar.Newcastle fans are sweating over the fitness of Alexander Isak, while the post World Cup wellbeing of Richarlison and Rodrigo Bentancur is causing palpitations for those at Spurs. Fulham’s Neeskens Kebano faces a long spell on the sidelines after rupturing his achilles and the USA’s hugely impressive young skipper Tyler Adams will be absent from the Leeds United side to host Manchester City next week as he sits the game out on the naughty step after being sent off in the madcap 4-3 defeat at Tottenham before the World Cup, another classic pre-World Cup game we have probably all forgotten.And so to Old Trafford, where Manchester United are once again preparing for life after Cristiano Ronaldo, who severed ties with the club while enduring a particularly miserable World Cup. It was recently announced that Jadon Sancho has been sent to the Netherlands to train with a crack team of experts tasked with getting a tune out of a player who has inexplicably underwhelmed.In the boardroom, the ever unpopular Glazers have announced they are going forward with “their process” of securing new investors or nailing down a potential sale. It did not go unnoticed that Joel Glazer, with whom the buck stops regarding all decisions at Old Trafford, was seen at the World Cup glad-handing potential Arab investors. That or he has developed a hitherto well hidden love of football, a sport he has shown no obvious interest in since his late father first started hosing other people’s money at United in 2003. Consider yourself vaguely briefed, now enjoy the football.","['proper smash in the face', 'do a Leicester', 'Lamps', 'their process']",

There is also interest from Chelsea but Mudryk, who turns 22 on Thursday, has his heart set on the Premier League leaders.He has posted pictures on social media that show he has been watching Arsenal’s two most recent matches and described Mikel Arteta as a “top coach” during Saturday’s 4-2 victory at Brighton.Mudryk impressed in the Champions League group stage, scoring three times – twice against Celtic and once against Leipzig – and has seven goals in his past eight league appearances for Shakhtar, who are on a winter break.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballArteta has urged Arsenal to make signings and to do so as swiftly as possible.

"David Gold, joint-chairman of West Ham United, dies at age of 86",The Guardian,Guardian sport,2023-01-04,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/david-gold-joint-chairman-west-ham-dies-at-86,"David Gold, who has died at the age of 86 after a short illness, had West Ham in his heart throughout his life. When Gold was a boy he did not have to look far for his boyhood club. West Ham’s former co-owner grew up at 442 Green Street, in a house directly opposite Upton Park, and there was never any chance of him becoming anything other than a lifelong Hammer.Gold, whose death was announced by the Premier League club on Wednesday, loved West Ham. He was a promising schoolboy footballer who represented represented the club’s boys’ team between the ages of 13 and 16 and later appeared in the youth team. Football was in his blood. He did not make it as a professional, but he would find a way to return to the game after forging a successful business career.It was a hard road. Gold recalled growing up in “abject poverty” and said his family had no money. He started work aged 14 in an attempt to make ends meet. Gold and his brother, Ralph, would later own Gold Group International, the parent company of Knickerbox and the Ann Summers chain of adult stores. In 1986 the Gold brothers helped David Sullivan launch the downmarket Sunday Sport newspaper.Sullivan’s partnership with Gold grew. In 1993 they entered the world of football with the purchase of Birmingham City, who would win promotion to the Premier League nine years later. Karren Brady was appointed as the Midlands club’s managing director, making her the first woman on the board of a Football League team.A fruitful relationship was born. Sullivan, Gold and Brady left Birmingham in 2009 and turned up at West Ham in January 2010. It was a challenging time. West Ham’s Icelandic owners had left the club in huge financial trouble and relegation from the top flight was on the cards. As West Ham said in their statement yesterday, Gold was partly responsible for helping “to steady the ship and protect the Club’s future during a period of great financial uncertainty”.It was not always easy. West Ham were relegated in 2011 and won promotion a year later. At times supporters have hit out at Sullivan and Gold, accusing the pair of a lack of investment in the club. However people who know Gold, who was part of the drive to take the east London club from Upton Park to the London Stadium in 2016, always spoke of his passion for West Ham.“On behalf of everyone at the football club, it is with profound sorrow and a heavy heart that we mourn the passing of our colleague and friend, David Gold,” Sullivan said of his old friend yesterday.“Of all our joint ventures, none gave us more pride and happiness than the day we took ownership of West Ham United, our Club, in January 2010. David had a long-standing connection with the Hammers, having grown up opposite the Boleyn Ground in Green Street, and represented the Club at junior level. He always wanted what was best for West Ham United, and his passing is a great loss for all of us.”Gold, who was proud of his Jewish heritage, was a popular figure. He was a regular presence at West Ham’s training ground and was described by many people as a kind and generous man.“I am extremely sad to hear this news and, on behalf of all of the players and my staff at the training ground, I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to David Gold’s family at this very difficult time,” West Ham’s manager, David Moyes said. “Mr Gold was a regular visitor to Rush Green and always a source of great support and encouragement to myself and the players.“It was clear that he had a genuine and sincere love for the Club and was a true supporter at heart. He took a great interest in the people working behind the scenes and was always keen to help in any way he could. He will be greatly missed.”It is anticipated that Gold’s 25% stake in the club will pass to his daughters, Vanessa and Jacqueline, and that the family will continue to have a presence on the board. Sullivan is the club’s largest shareholder with a stake of 38.8%. The Czech billionaire, Daniel Kretinsky, is an increasingly influential voice after buying a 27% stake in November 2021.West Ham added that Gold’s daughters and his fiancee, Lesley, were by his side when he passed away.","['abject poverty', 'to steady the ship and protect the Club’s future during a period of great financial uncertainty', 'On behalf of everyone at the football club, it is with profound sorrow and a heavy heart that we mourn the passing of our colleague and friend, David Gold,', 'Of all our joint ventures, none gave us more pride and happiness than the day we took ownership of West Ham United, our Club, in January 2010.

Decisive Odegaard leads from front as Arsenal scale new heights - Reuters,Reuters,,2023-01-01,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/decisive-odegaard-leads-front-arsenal-scale-new-heights-2023-01-01/,"Jan 1 (Reuters) - Any doubts whether a young Martin Odegaard could shoulder the responsibility of the captain's armband for Arsenal have been erased in half a season after he guided them to the top of the Premier League with a seven-point lead.Odegaard, who turned 24 last month, has been Arsenal's most influential player this season, oozing confidence in midfield and fuelling the club's first real title challenge in years.He leads the club's scoring charts with seven league goals and has five assists to boot, eclipsing his overall tally from the last campaign in just 15 games.He was front and centre again on Saturday as Arsenal extended their lead over reigning champions Manchester City with a 4-2 win at Brighton & Hove Albion to end 2022 on a high and underline their title credentials.The Norwegian scored Arsenal's second but impressed even more with a jaw-dropping assist from his own half for the fourth goal: a first-time through ball that carved open the defence and set Gabriel Martinelli on his way.""Martin Odegaard knows what he's doing before this ball comes ... A lot of people don't see that pass, he's probably the only player on the pitch who sees that,"" said Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson.""(City's) Kevin De Bruyne sees it, Odegaard sees it. But I don't think any other player in the Premier League sees it open up.""Having initially signed the midfielder on loan from Real Madrid, the 35 million euros ($37.46 million) Arsenal paid to make his move permanent now looks a steal.The fee was cheaper than the 42.5 million pounds ($51.40 million) Arsenal paid in 2013 to sign Mesut Ozil from the Spanish club - the same team where Odegaard was hardly given the opportunity to establish himself.Mikel Arteta's side had lacked a genuine playmaker since Ozil's acrimonious exit but Odegaard gives the north London club much more than just a creative outlet in midfield with a sharp eye for a pass.The Norway international is not averse to dropping deep to help out the defence, be it by providing an escape route under pressure from the opponents' press or by getting his socks dirty in winning the ball back.""He's doing what we want him to do, to decide football matches and work really hard and deliver to the team what it needs in each moment of every game, which is different,"" Arteta said.Odegaard's transformation has drawn parallels with former club captain Cesc Fabregas, who was tasked with leading the side at the tender age of 21 by ex-manager Arsene Wenger.""I was desperate to sign him (when he was 15), fortunately, he is here now. He really is like a young Cesc Fabregas,"" Wenger told TV2.""He has developed into a complete player. He's a very calm player who analyses the game well. He has his feet firmly planted on the ground.""Arsenal had been looking to appoint a full-time captain after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was stripped of the armband over a disciplinary breach last season.And Arteta had no qualms about handing Odegaard the responsibility despite the presence of more senior players.""He has represented the values of this football club, the team... in the best possible way,"" Arteta said.

Premier League and its players enter unknown territory after World Cup | Jonathan Wilson,The Guardian,Jonathan Wilson,2022-12-24,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/dec/24/premier-league-and-its-players-enter-unknown-territory-after-world-cup,"Usually there’s a month off for players to reset but this time it’s just days for those coming off Qatar’s highs and lowsIt is late at night when the four hobbits arrive at the Brandywine Bridge. They are shocked to find it barred and they have to plead with the Shirriffs to let them in. The Shire has changed since they went away, trees chopped down, old buildings swept aside, the inns closed. Sandyman’s Mill has been replaced by an ugly new building, full of noisy machinery that pollutes the air and the river. This is not the homecoming they have dreamed of.Merry blows the horn given him by Éowyn of Rohan and they raise the Shire then scour it but, still, there is a sense of anticlimax. After everything they have been through on Mount Doom, there is an unavoidable bathos about such mundane concerns and, after a time, Frodo, still grappling with the physical and psychological consequences of his quest, departs, granted passage to the blessed realms of Valinor.It is midwinter when the five Argentinian World Cup winners arrive back in the Premier League. It is cold and wet and a darkness has settled upon the land. Matches seem to arrive in no set pattern: a Carabao Cup tie here, a league fixture there, then a trip to some lower-division opponent in the FA Cup. Hapless cloggers kick them. Scots and Swedes and Nigerians all seem to have points to prove. There is endless discussion of points and tables and qualification for European competition. After the operatic finale in Doha, can the Argentinians be blamed if none of it seems to matter much, if they look at the mundane squabbles of the Premier League and find themselves struggling to engage?The scenes in Buenos Aires on Tuesday were extraordinary. Almost five million people, 10% of the entire Argentinian population, turned out to greet the World Cup winners home. Too many, as it turned out, and the victory parade had to be aborted, the bus abandoned for a helicopter. The old certainties are always heartening; of course the Argentinian Football Association couldn’t organise a booze-up on a broad boulevard. There were various shots of players smoking cigars and glugging red wine from sawn-off plastic bottles. And why not? What is football about if it is not about celebrating the greatest glory the game can bring?But how do those players return to civilian life, to the petty concerns of the everyday? Alexis Mac Allister, 24 on Christmas Eve, has been given two weeks off by Brighton, which is surely right: how could anybody flip from playing a key role in a World Cup win to a tricky away game at Southampton? Mac Allister’s is the most intriguing case: there is something wonderful about a Brighton player being world champion but it also means, however good Brighton were in the early part of the season, if anybody can still remember that, chatter about his future is inevitable. For him, January will surely be full of rumours and offers – which of course will only make reintegration harder.Emi Martínez, the dark lord of the penalty shootout, is 30. Aston Villa may be his peak, although Bayern are apparently considering him as a replacement for Manuel Neuer, who is 37 and broke his leg in a skiing accident after his return from Qatar. Martínez has a new manager to adjust to in Unai Emery. Perhaps there will be another big shootout in his future and more gamesmanship to deploy. But there’s a realistic chance that, for him, everything peaked last Sunday.Sign up to The RecapThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionCristian Romero and Lisandro Martínez, both 24, are approaching their peak, both playing for emerging sides for whom Champions League qualification is far from certain. Martínez replied to a message of congratulation from Scott McTominay by saying: “We go for the next one,” but, improved as Manchester United have been this season, winning a trophy with them may be difficult.Julián Álvarez, 23 next month, is young and obviously enormously talented. After the official celebrations in Buenos Aires, he went back to his home village of Calchín in Córdoba, where he paraded through the streets on the back of a fire engine, siren blaring. He can realistically dream of league titles and Champions Leagues, of glories in his future. But he has started only three league games so far this season; the priority for him at Manchester City is finding a way to play alongside Erling Haaland.And it’s not just the winners. How will Hugo Lloris react to the disappointment of losing in the final? Will Harry Kane be haunted by his penalty miss against France? Is Kevin De Bruyne extra-driven after Belgium’s group-stage exit, but if so can that last? How will Fabian Schär respond after his nightmare against Portugal? Are Bernardo Silva and Bruno Fernandes seething after Portugal’s quarter-final exit to Morocco?This is unknown territory. World Cup hangovers affect different players in different ways and determining the general impact is difficult. But that there is an impact seems hard to dispute. Before Qatar, there had been five World Cups this century and in four of the seasons that have followed them, the points total accrued by the champions has been down on the year before. The only exception is 2014-15 when Chelsea gained a point more than City had the year before – the totemic power of José Mourinho’s second season in his second stint at the club and three key signings overriding the after-effects of a World Cup.But usually there’s a month for players to reset after a tournament; this time there is a matter of days. Some players will be given extra time off but some will plunge straight back in, with the transfer window an additional factor, games taking place as players who have impressed at the World Cup look to negotiate new deals. There are a lot of random factors at play this January.The assumption is that, particularly with Gabriel Jesus injured, Arsenal will fall away and Manchester City will stroll to the title. But the season is barely a third done. There is still the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup, not to mention Europe, still more than five months until a proper break. The prospect is mildly enticing but mainly exhausting; there is an awful lot of football between now and the end of the season.Whatever has happened in Mordor, in the Shire, life goes on.","['We go for the next one,']",
Pep Guardiola: fit and firing Erling Haaland will only get better,The Guardian,Will Unwin at Elland Road,2022-12-28,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/28/pep-guardiola-fit-and-firing-erling-haaland-will-only-get-better,"Pep Guardiola believes Erling Haaland will only get better after being able to build his fitness during the World Cup break.Haaland struck his 19th and 20th of the season to help beat Leeds 3-1 in only his 14th Premier League appearance for the club. The Norwegian arrived in the summer from Borussia Dortmund where he missed large portions of last season through injury. Due to Norway’s absence from Qatar 2022, Haaland avoided the mental and physical stress of tournament football.“I think he is still not at his best because of the injury, to move his huge body is not easy for him but as much as he can play, minutes will be better,” Guardiola said. “I had the feeling he is not at his best. It is a matter of time. [He is] always an incredible threat for the opponent. The numbers are unbelievable but I have the feeling he is not just coming here for the numbers, he wants to win it. Still there are 70 points to play for.”Haaland admitted he could have scored five at Elland Road to add to his incredible tally. “He missed chances, hopefully he can do better, but the numbers are exceptional, an incredible threat for us and always in the right position at the right time,” Guardiola said.The victory at Elland Road puts City five points behind leaders Arsenal with Haaland completing 90 minutes as he looks to grow sharper in front of goal. He scored against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup last week in the first game after the break that saw him recuperated. “When we started to train in Abu Dhabi he could not train one single day, maybe the last one.”The rest has done him good. “I kind of recharged my batteries and to watch other people score and win games in the World Cup kind of triggers me and motivates me and also irritates me,” Haaland told Amazon. “I’m more hungry and more ready than ever.”Haaland’s goals at Leeds got the better of his former RB Salzburg coach Jesse Marsch, who he is still close to. “I am just really happy for him,” Marsch said. “In some ways watching him score is painful, I want him in a different kit.“But when you know some of these young men, and you see their qualities as people, you want them to do their best, just not against your team. But my gosh, I am happy for him, he is such a great person.”","['I think he is still not at his best because of the injury, to move his huge body is not easy for him but as much as he can play, minutes will be better,', 'I had the feeling he is not at his best.

"Mark Noble: ‘If a top club wants Declan Rice they’re just going to pay for him, full stop’",The Guardian,Donald McRae,2022-12-20,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/20/mark-noble-declan-rice-west-ham-sporting-director,"West Ham’s sporting director on competing with giants, youthful selfishness and why he expects more countries to buy clubsAs Mark Noble considers the enormous task he will face in his new role as West Ham’s sporting director, he shares his belief that, “in the next 10 to 15 years probably half of the Premier League’s teams will be owned by countries”. Noble played more than 500 games for West Ham, from 2004 to May this year, and the consistency and loyalty of that commitment stand in sharp contrast with the outlandish riches which will transform the Premier League much further.“People love football, globally,” Noble says as he prepares to begin his challenging position in January. “Other sports are fantastic but they don’t [generate] that affection, yes obsession, we have with football. I’m talking about countries that people don’t even know exist which love football.”The 35-year-old might not sound worldly in that last sentence but the way in which Manchester City and Newcastle United have already been taken over by consortiums led by members of the royal families in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia has set a clear precedent. Manchester United and Liverpool may be sold next year and different nations could enter the bidding.David Sullivan and David Gold, West Ham’s owners since January 2010, enjoy their reputation as local wheelers-and-dealers, but how does the prospect of half the Premier League being owned by countries make Noble feel? “Well, it depends,” he says, as he starts to laugh. “It depends if we are [owned by a nation]. The great thing about the Premier League is, because there is a lot of financial power, the games ain’t as easy as they would be in other leagues. But if you want the best players it’s different.“I saw an interview with Erling Haaland’s agent [Rafaela Pimenta] the other day and she was saying: ‘Well, why ain’t Haaland worth a billion because of his image rights, contracts and everything else that goes with him? You laugh but then you think about it and, when you actually break it down, future global superstars probably will be worth [a billion pounds].”How will Noble react when part of his remit as sporting director will be to help West Ham cope with the astronomical wealth accumulated by rivals such as Manchester City? “You’ve got the top six, maybe even seven in the Premier League. You’ve got two or three in the German league and the same in the Spanish league. In the French league, obviously you’ve got PSG [owned by Qatar] and one or two others. So we’re not in that market because the Champions League is a massive draw for players.“We need to be in the market of probably 25 teams across Europe. Maybe from fourth to eighth in the Spanish league, the same in the German league. Those are our rivals when we are recruiting players because we can’t afford to buy who we want. It’s not going to happen. So we’ve got to be clever and find ways of recruiting young players and developing them, bringing them from the academy to the first team because that’s a massive plus. We’ve seen that with Declan Rice [who succeeded Noble as club captain], Ben Johnson [the West Ham defender], myself and others. A good young English player is worth 40 million quid. It’s incredible. So if we can produce three or four of them, we’re doing something right.”It is debatable whether West Ham can hold on to Rice much longer – especially when, at the World Cup, the England midfielder said how much he wants to play Champions League football and that “you only get one career”. Noble sounds pragmatic when discussing a player he has mentored for years and as the Premier League resumes on Boxing Day with West Ham, two places above the relegation zone, away to the leaders Arsenal.“Whether you think things will get dicey at West Ham – and I don’t believe they will – we just can’t cope financially with the top teams. We can try our hardest to recruit the best players that the top five or six don’t buy – and we might get lucky with a few that slip through the net – but you can’t compete with these teams. They’re financially too powerful. If a top club wants Declan Rice they’re just going to pay for him, full stop. You’ve seen it with Jack Grealish, with the best players. If the top boys want them, we ain’t got a chance.”There is more romance in Noble’s personal story as Mr West Ham and, as his new book captures, he thrived as a one-club player whose career is unlikely to be emulated in such a volatile and money-driven future for Premier League football. There are parallels with Steven Gerrard at Liverpool but Noble lived so close to West Ham, whose academy he joined at 13, that he could walk home after he made his first-team debut at Upton Park four years later. He was with his girlfriend, Carly, who is now his wife.“I wasn’t prepared for two middle-aged men to spot me in the street,” Noble recalls in his book. “‘Well done, Marky boy,’ one shouted. ‘Oh my God, Mark,’ Carly said as we walked on. ‘He knew who you were.’”That affection for Noble, who had been waiting outside the Boleyn ground to ask West Ham players for their autographs six months earlier, grew into a profound love affair between the supporters and their eventual captain. It helped that he grew up in nearby Beckton but Noble also showed a dedication to help West Ham in any way he could. However, he reveals how that close bond came at a cost. Noble put football above everything else and the strain often felt consuming.He and Carly “got chicken and chips” on their walk home after his debut but it did not take long for him to change. He became single-minded and prioritised football – at the expense of Carly, his family and friends. “I’m open about that,” he says. “There were times that everything got on top of me. You’ve got to be the Premier League footballer and West Ham academy graduate – but also a best mate, a husband, father, a son, a brother. We had our two kids really young and I thought: ‘I’ve got no choice now. I have to become successful. I have to be able to provide for Carly and the kids.’ But I became incredibly selfish.”Noble comes across as a lovely man but he suggests that, when he was younger, he acted like “a pig” towards Carly. “I use that word because I was so obsessed with getting better. I was also representing my own people [fellow West Ham fans] and I didn’t want to let anyone down. I concentrated so much on that side there were times I let Carly down. If she was sat here now, she’d tell me to shut up and say that was my job. But when you get older you get less selfish.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballThe demands were draining and Noble admits there were times where “I had broken relationships with other family members”. It became difficult for him to enjoy even the good times. “You almost become immune to the good times. They just bring relief because points are so sacred in the Premier League that if you win it’s relief more than joy. Joy is when you’re 17 and you break into the first team and everyone thinks you’re a hero. But I became a senior pro at 21 and you’re expected to win, you’re expected to play well.”Noble also felt, at a very young age, that he could never show any weakness. “It’s so different now, mate. Back then the senior pros didn’t allow it. I agree with the new system but, in a lot of ways I don’t, because football is a ruthless industry where it feels like there is no place for weakness. Everyone’s job’s on the line and if you go into training with a grade two hamstring tear, you know you can’t train. But if you go in and say: ‘I’m not mentally stable or in the right frame of mind to train today,’ people would say: ‘What are you fucking on about?’“You’d be surprised how many players are struggling. They’re going through issues but don’t say anything. But it is getting so much better now because some players are talking about [mental health] … and when I speak to academy players now I say: ‘Forget what you see in the public eye. Forget the nice cars, the big houses and the nice watches. That’s 2% of what it means to be a footballer.’”Noble will be heavily involved in recruitment, development of the academy and the wellbeing of players. “I love the game but I also love the business side of football,” Noble says. “My relationship with [West Ham’s manager] David Moyes over the past two and a half years is probably one of the reasons that West Ham asked me to do this job.”Yet West Ham’s fans seem disillusioned with the season so far. “Probably a group of fans, yes. But there’s always going to be that at every club now. You hear people saying the fans are not happy with [Jürgen] Klopp at Liverpool. That’s the industry we work in now and, because of social media, it has become a lot louder.”Describing this season as “a transition” for West Ham, Noble is at his most animated when talking about Lionel Messi. “What it must be like to be Messi,” he says with wonder as his words mingle with laughter. “He’s on another planet. I watched his documentary [before the World Cup] and you look at the experience he had losing three [Copa América] finals in a row and losing the World Cup final and then always being compared to [Diego] Maradona. He was fucking distraught and he is the greatest that’s ever walked the earth.“I remember when Chelsea played against him and JT [John Terry] came flying across and he was on the touchline ready to try and body him into the stands and Messi stood there, took it and bounced JT. I also remember Manu Lanzini [his former West Ham teammate] coming back from Argentina duty and I was like: ‘Oh mate, what was Messi like?’ Manu’s a genius with the ball but he said: ‘I swear to you, when he passed me the ball, I was so nervous because he was on my team.’ Manu said Messi would be floating about in training and then he would think: ‘Oh, do you know what? I want to win this game.’ And he’d score six goals.”The simple joy of football shines in Noble – as it will when he embraces the breaks from recruitment and monitoring mental health to step out on the academy pitch with teenage hopefuls to whom he can give a few pointers. All the headaches of being the Boleyn boy trying to keep up with clubs owned by countries will be forgotten for a while. And maybe, I suggest, the academy kids will look up to him as their local version of Messi.“I’m not sure about that,” Noble says amid his laughter. “But I love football. I love all parts of football.”Boleyn Boy by Mark Noble is published by HarperCollins. To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

The great thing about the Premier League is, because there is a lot of financial power, the games ain’t as easy as they would be in other leagues. But if you want the best players it’s different', 'I saw an interview with Erling Haaland’s agent [Rafaela Pimenta] the other day and she was saying: ‘Well, why ain’t Haaland worth a billion because of his image rights, contracts and everything else that goes with him? You laugh but then you think about it and, when you actually break it down, future global superstars probably will be worth [a billion pounds].', 'You’ve got the top six, maybe even seven in the Premier League. You’ve got two or three in the German league and the same in the Spanish league. In the French league, obviously you’ve got PSG [owned by Qatar] and one or two others. So we’re not in that market because the Champions League is a massive draw for players', 'We need to be in the market of probably 25 teams across Europe. Maybe from fourth to eighth in the Spanish league, the same in the German league. Those are our rivals when we are recruiting players because we can’t afford to buy who we want. It’s not going to happen. So we’ve got to be clever and find ways of recruiting young players and developing them, bringing them from the academy to the first team because that’s a massive plus. We’ve seen that with Declan Rice [who succeeded Noble as club captain], Ben Johnson [the West Ham defender], myself and others. A good young English player is worth 40 million quid. It’s incredible. So if we can produce three or four of them, we’re doing something right.', 'you only get one career', 'Whether you think things will get dicey at West Ham – and I don’t believe they will – we just can’t cope financially with the top teams. We can try our hardest to recruit the best players that the top five or six don’t buy – and we might get lucky with a few that slip through the net – but you can’t compete with these teams. They’re financially too powerful. If a top club wants Declan Rice they’re just going to pay for him, full stop. You’ve seen it with Jack Grealish, with the best players.

Pep Guardiola admits City reign ‘not complete’ without Champions League,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson,2022-12-21,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/21/guardiola-says-manchester-city-reign-not-complete-without-champions-league-title,"Pep Guardiola has said for the first time that if Manchester City do not win the Champions League under him his highly successful tenure will “not be complete.”Since becoming City manager in the summer of 2016 Guardiola had won five Premier League titles, four League Cups and the FA Cup. But he is yet to lead the club to the Champions League title and has previously always played down the importance of doing so.Guardiola signed a one-year contract extension last month with an option to extend it until 2025 and he was asked if winning Europe’s most important club competition had been a motivating factor in that decision.“It’s not the only one but I admit it’s the trophy we want and my period here will not be complete if we don’t win it,” he said. “But that’s not the only reason [I signed]. I will do everything in the time we have together to win it but I’d say the same before [signing]. It’s the trophy we don’t have and we’ll try to do it. I have the feeling they [City] will get it sooner or later. We’ve tried in the past, even in the first season even though we went out in the last 16. So we will try with all our strength.”City are back in action on Thursday night for the first time since the break in domestic football for the World Cup when they host Liverpool in the Carabao Cup last-16 tie. While five of Liverpool’s squad were in Qatar compared to 16 of City’s with Julián Álvarez yet to return after being a member of Argentina’s triumphant team, Guardiola has no concerns about a tournament hangover.“I have the feeling that those who were at the World Cup are in better condition than players who weren’t, the players who didn’t go lack rhythm, the ones who come back have been competing and trained every day,” he said.“Players who were not at the World Cup and who play can get the rhythm tomorrow so we have to do it with what we have. Step by step they come back – we have six players back [already] and are happy they are back, in general they played really well and had an incredible experience.”While the England players – Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, Kalvin Phillips and John Stones – were among those back in training on Wednesday – Guardiola congratulated Álvarez, who ended the tournament with four goals. “We are incredibly happy for him,” he said.When City lost October’s league game at Liverpool Jurgen Klopp was sent off after berating an assistant referee, while the fixture has a history of hostility. This moved each club to write to fans to call for calm on Thursday. and Guardiola agreed this means extra emphasis is on the managers to behave properly.“Definitely,” he said, then joked. “We want to behave good: the players, the managers, the spectators but sometimes emotion means people can’t behave like a statue. We will always react in that way but the respect for the officials, the rules and the opponent is always there from my point of view. Reactions happen that’s why the referees are there. It’s just a game let’s make people happy, that’s what we try to do.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballThe Arsenal forward Gabriel Jesus – who left City in the summer for £45m after five years at the Etihad – suffered a knee injury at the World Cup that may rule him out until February. City trail Arsenal by five points and Guardiola was asked if the Brazilian’s enforced absence may offer an advantage.“I’m so sorry for Gabriel, that’s for sure and I would prefer him to play for Arsenal. He’s an important player for them like he was for us,” he said .“I want to wish him a speedy recovery. [But at the moment] I don’t think about what we have to do with Arsenal. I start to think about what we have to do to win tomorrow, Leeds [in the league] and the next game. I’m so sorry for him.

Conte says had no doubts about Kane's response to World Cup ... - Reuters,Reuters,,2022-12-26,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/conte-says-had-no-doubts-about-kanes-response-world-cup-anguish-2022-12-26/,"LONDON, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte said he had no doubts that Harry Kane would rise above the disappointment of his World Cup heartache as the Premier League season resumed on Monday.Kane matched Wayne Rooney's England goal-scoring by converting a penalty in the World Cup quarter-final against France but later missed a penalty in the 2-1 defeat.He got straight back to business on Monday though with a majestic 65th minute header to spark a Tottenham revival in a 2-2 draw at Brentford after Spurs has trailed 2-0.""Personally, about Harry, I have zero doubt about his quality, about his mentality, about the way he approached every game and every training session,"" Conte told reporters.""For sure, for Harry, he's facing a strange situation because he played a really good World Cup. The team played the quarter-final, then he missed this penalty. It was a decisive penalty. But you know very well, football is this.""You can have positive or negative moments. If you are strong mentally, if you are a top player, there is a moment you have to put to one side a negative situation and move on. I think Harry did this.""Brentford fans had taunted Kane with chants of ""you let your country down' but Conte said fans should instead clap him.It was Kane's 13th goal of the season and six minutes later Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's well-taken goal ensured Tottenham took a share of the points that had not looked likely after they trailed 2-0 in the 54th minute.It was the sixth Premier League game in a row that fourth-placed Tottenham had conceded the first goal, but the way they responded after the interval impressed Conte.""In one side, I have to be happy for the way, for the reaction, for the way we played in the second half of the game,"" Conte said. ""Not only the way we scored two goals, but the energy, the desire, the intensity that we played.""When you play in this way for sure you create a lot of problems for your opponent.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Belinda Bencic came through a second-set wobble to ease into the quarter-finals of the Adelaide International 2 with a 6-3 6-3 victory over Anna Kalinskaya on Wednesday.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

We have to get back to the work. It is as simple as that. I am a Premier League football manager, there is pressure in the job wherever you are,"" Lampard told Sky Sports following the Brighton defeat.With his team in 16th place on 15 points, three ahead of bottom side Southampton, Lampard and his players had a long discussion about what went wrong against the Seagulls at fulltime, but he remained tight-lipped about what was said.""I won't go through what was said in the dressing room afterwards, it's up to us to put it right and we go again against Manchester united in a few days,"" Lampard told reporters.After holding champions Manchester City to a 1-1 draw in their last game, Everton were booed off by the Goodison Park faithful at halftime when they went in 1-0 down to Brighton, but the worst was yet to come.A woeful spell saw the visitors net three goals between the 51st and 57th minutes, with Everton's only response coming from the penalty spot in second-half stoppage time.""Very disappointing.

"Everton v Wolves, Leicester v Newcastle and more: Premier League clockwatch – live",The Guardian,Simon Burnton,2022-12-26,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/dec/26/everton-v-wolves-leicester-v-newcastle-and-more-premier-league-live,"Boxing Day afternoon brought four Premier League games, 13 goals, two red cards and much dramaAnd with that, I’m done. Bye!And finally, here’s a report on Brighton’s victory over Southampton:Adam Lallana struck against his former club as Brighton inflicted more misery on struggling Southampton with a resounding 3-1 Premier League victory at St Mary’s.The Saints academy graduate Lallana benefited from a major blunder from the home goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu to put Albion ahead before Romain Perraud’s calamitous own goal doubled their half-time advantage.Brighton winger Solly March thumped home a third to cap a dismal first home game in top-flight management for the Southampton manager Nathan Jones.Much more here:Andy Hunter watched Wolves snatching all three points at an increasingly angry Goodison Park:Discontent was building among the home crowd inside Goodison Park even before the Wolves substitute Rayan Aït-Nouri gave Julen Lopetegui the perfect start to his reign and heightened the pressure on Frank Lampard with a 95th-minute winner against Everton. The French defender pounced in the final minute as Wolves secured a fortunate but dramatic victory that lifted them off the bottom of the Premier League.Everton’s overly cautious approach was generating dismay among their fans when James Tarkowski launched one final, long ball towards the Wolves penalty area. It returned with punishing interest, and after Aït-Nouri scrambled home a cross from fellow substitute Adama Traoré Everton were left to reflect on another ineffective, wasteful display. It is now six defeats in eight league games for Lampard’s faltering side. Improvement in the final third cannot come quickly enough for Everton.Much more here:Peter Lansley witnessed Newcastle’s emphatic win at a limp Leicester:Not even the World Cup has proved a deterrent in Newcastle United’s pursuit of Champions League football as Eddie Howe’s team climbed into second place in the Premier League with a victory secured in just over half an hour.Early goals from Chris Wood, from the penalty spot, Miguel Almirón and Joelinton brought Newcastle a 10th win in 11 games in all competitions against one of the division’s supposed in-form teams, for whom the six-week international break in Qatar proved a block rather than a spur. On this evidence, Newcastle should relish hosting these opponents again in a fortnight in the Carabao Cup quarter-final.Much more here:Ed Aarons was at Selhurst Park to see Fulham romp to three goals and just as many points:Patrick Vieira must be wondering how his side got this so wrong. Crystal Palace’s hopes of recording a fourth successive home victory in the Premier League for the first time in their history were destroyed in a three-minute spell in the first half by a clinical Fulham team led by the brilliant Aleksandar Mitrovic.The disastrous defending that allowed Bobby DeCordova-Reid to open the scoring on 31 minutes was compounded by Tyrick Mitchell’s rush of blood to the head that earned him a straight red card and left Vieira’s side with a mountain to climb. Another red card for James Tomkins – making his first Premier League start since Boxing Day last year in absence of the suspended Marc Guehi – and further goals from Fulham’s captain Tim Ream and Mitrovic, with his tenth of the campaign, swept Marco Silva’s side to a deserved victory that leaves them level on points with Liverpool.Much more here:The games just keep on coming, and Rob Smyth is on Aston Villa v Liverpool here:Total number of goalless draws in today’s English football league schedule: one.

So for now, there’s this:Crystal Palace 0-3 FulhamEverton 1-2 Wolverhampton WanderersLeicester City 0-3 Newcastle UnitedSouthampton 1-2 Brighton & Hove AlbionWell that’s going to sting.Southampton (2.04) 1-3 (0.91) BrightonWolves have nicked it on the break in the last minute! Traore is released on the right and his cross deflects to Ait-Nouri, who smacks it in!Newcastle somehow fail to score a fourth! Murphy rounds the keeper and has a chance to roll the ball into a net guarded only by Wout Faes, but he hits Faes with his shot and it goes wide!Into stoppage time at Goodison Park, where Everton have been pushing for a late winner. They’ve got another five minutes to find one.Another excellent save, this time from Pope to stop Vardy pulling a goal back for Leicester against Newcastle.A brilliant point-blank save from Sa, coming out to claim a cross, realising he’s not going to get there and doing the next best thing, stops Everton going ahead.On Prime, Martin Keown describes that Willian touch as “a lovely little cross”, which I think is a very generous analysis of what looked like a miskick, but hey, it’s Christmas.Personally I’m entirely in favour of post-tackle celebrations. This isn’t exactly a tackle, though, more of a sliding deflection into touch. Still, if you enjoy it, why not let the world know?Celebrating a tackle like it was a goal 💪Bruno Guimarães is one of a kind 😍 pic.twitter.com/iXTdXdV4U2A third for Fulham! A cross from the right loops beyond the far post to Willian, who scuffs his volley into the ground and it bounces up nicely for Mitrovic to head in from four yards.There was a long delay after that second Fulham goal while the VAR pondered whether the ball had hit Mitrovic’s hand on its way to Ream. It looked like it did, but the goal stands anyway.James Ward-Prowse brings Southampton back into the game, heading in the rebound after his own penalty is well saved by Sanchez.Of course there’ll be lots of Palace fans who can’t get no sleep after this. Fulham swing in a corner, Mitrovic knocks down and Ream slams it into the roof of the net!A minute’s applause at Crystal Palace for the Palace fan Maxi Jazz, the Faithless frontman who died this week.Sheffield United are now 2-0 up against Coventry, Ciaran Clark with the second. At Selhurst Park, Fulham are threatening to run riot against a now woefully undermanned Crystal Palace. James Tomkins brings down Mitrovic and earns himself a second booking. A weird challenge – the ball is played back towards the keeper and rather than running back to shepherd it towards its target he stands still and sticks out an arm to block Mitrovic, who runs into it, goes down and rolls around a bit. The Mitrovic dramatics weren’t really necessary, but it was a deliberate movement and Tomkins can’t really quibble.A fabulous left-foot rocket from March, 25 yards from goal, sends the ball flying into the top corner!Sheffield United, second in the Championship with six wins in their last seven, concede a penalty against Coventry. Wes Foderingham saves, and they remain 1-0 up.Leicester have brought Jamie Vardy on for Daka at half-time. Southampton have made two changes, bringing Stuart Armstrong and Joe Aribo on, and taking off Diallo and Djenepo.Second halves are under way. Strap yourselves back in for another 45 minutes of fun.Here are all the Football League scores as they stand. Teams winning away from home in the Premier League: three (out of four). Teams winning away from home in the Championship, League One and League Two combined: five (out of 28).Crystal Palace 0-1 FulhamEverton 1-1 Wolverhampton WanderersLeicester City 0-3 Newcastle UnitedSouthampton 0-2 Brighton & Hove AlbionBristol City 0-1 West Bromwich AlbionHull City 0-1 BlackpoolMiddlesbrough 1-0 Wigan AthleticPreston North End 1-0 Huddersfield TownRotherham United 1-0 Stoke CitySheffield United 1-0 Coventry CityAccrington Stanley 0-1 BarnsleyBurton Albion 3-0 Lincoln CityCambridge United 0-0 Shrewsbury TownCharlton Athletic 0-0 Peterborough UnitedCheltenham Town 0-0 Plymouth ArgyleExeter City 0-0 PortsmouthFleetwood Town 1-1 Sheffield WednesdayIpswich Town 2-0 Oxford UnitedMilton Keynes Dons 0-0 Forest Green RoversPort Vale 1-0 MorecambeWycombe Wanderers 1-1 Bristol RoversCarlisle United 1-0 Bradford CityCrawley Town 0-0 Sutton UnitedGillingham 0-1 Colchester UnitedHarrogate Town 1-1 Grimsby TownMansfield Town 0-0 Northampton TownRochdale 0-1 Hartlepool UnitedSalford City 1-0 BarrowStockport County 0-0 Crewe AlexandraSwindon Town 0-0 WalsallTranmere Rovers 1-0 Doncaster RoversWimbledon 0-0 Newport CountyThe Premier League is very much leading the way on the goal front today. There have been eight first-half goals in its four 3pm kick-offs, and no other team in the Football League has more than one except struggling Burton Albion in League One, who look to be on their way to a first league win since 22 October being as they are 3-0 up against Lincoln City.Pervis Estupinan’s low cross from the left gets past the keeper at the near post and Romain Perraud has to do something to stop March just tapping it in. And, in his wisdom, he chooses to tap it in himself. Bobby Reid puts Fulham ahead with a nice first-time finish, and a few seconds later Tyrick Mitchell mistimes a challenge and is given his marching orders!Martin Logan emails to point out that another goal description has gone missing and Newcastle are in fact two up, Almiron having scored a very fine seventh-minute second. And as I’m redescribing that Joelinton heads in a corner and, just as Podence did when he scored for Wolves, stuffs the ball up his shirt in celebration!At Selhurst Park, Jordan Ayew’s first-time effort from 15 yards or so absolutely thunders into the crossbar. A chance for Leicester, after Dewsbury-Hall plays in Daka. Pope flies out and Daka hits the ball into him, it ricochets back into Daka, and then rolls gently goalwards allowing a defender to clear.That is a lovely equaliser. It starts with a Wolves corner, taken short. The ball in lands at the feet of Moutinho, just outside the area, and he lifts a beautiful right-foot pass over the defence and Podence runs through and tucks in!A bit of a technical hiccup here saw a couple of entries disappear somewhere between my computer and the rest of the world. Anyway, Yerry Mina scored a while ago, heading in from a corner after his marker fell over.Don't leave Yerry Mina free in the box... he'll do this! 🔵The best possible start for @Everton at Goodison Park!#PLonPrime #EVEWOL pic.twitter.com/8IVE1fHqvvA lovely move from Brighton ends with a cross from the right-hand corner of the area, and a nicely-judged glancing header from Adam Lallana. In truth it was too close to the keeper, who should have pushed it to safety but opted instead to flap it in haplessly.If Hugo Bueno is going to mark Yerry Mina at every set piece, this could get very messy for Wolves.And that’s how to take a penalty. The goalkeeper dives to his left and the ball goes hard and high the other way.Penalty to Newcastle! Less than two minutes on the clock and Amartey has brought down Joelinton. You could watch football forever and never see a clearer penalty.Peeeeeep! They’re off!There will be a minute’s applause before all the Premier League games for George Cohen, who died this week.The players are coming out, and the clock is about to strike football o’clock!Here’s Jeremy Alexander’s match report on that game. Absolutely brutal final sentence.“I remember Oldham 11 Southport 0 on Boxing Day 1962,” writes Mike Fitzgerald. “The local Southport Visitor newspaper headlined their match report, “SOUTHPORT CAN’T ’OLDAM.” The Boxing Day game that stands out in my memory was travelling to watch my team (Watford) at Fulham in 2000. We lost 5-0 and afterwards I remember talking to Jeremy Alexander, who was reporting on the game for the Guardian, had to file the teams in formation and wasn’t sure given the chaos what Watford’s shape had been. Between us we eventually settled on three at the back and a fluid (or more accurately completely disorganised) midfield seven. “Re your photo of Goodison’s Main Stand, about 20 years ago I took my father on a stadium tour,” writes Gary Naylor. “Our guide walked in to say hello, a strongly built guy of average height, and my father’s face transformed - Dave Hickson. Both long gone now, but a moment to remember.” Lovely memory of a magnificent old stadium. Sadly now the photograph has long gone too.Team news is in, and the Premier League protagonists are these:Crystal Palace v FulhamCrystal Palace: Guaita; Clyne, Tomkins, Andersen, Mitchell; Schlupp, Doucoure, Eze; Olise, Ayew, Zaha.

‘He will be eternal’: Premier League managers lead tributes to Pelé,The Guardian,Guardian sport and agencies,2022-12-30,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/its-like-a-great-book-people-will-always-talk-about-pele-because-he-was-so-good,"Pep Guardiola insists Pelé could have “played in every generation” and that the Brazilian’s influence on the world game will be everlasting as he joined other Premier League coaches in paying tribute to the three-times World Cup winner after his death on Thursday.“When I was nine, 10 I started to watch some games,” said the Manchester City manager. “Now I realise how strong he could do everything. People say the rhythm in the period was completely different but these type of players playing right now, he would have adapted the rhythm and spaces because he was so good. They control the games, so good in skills and mentality and everything. He could play in every generation.”Guardiola added: “Neymar said a great sentence when he said before [Pelé’s] No 10 was just a number and after it became something special. Every top player wanted to wear No 10 in their team. What he has done for football is there and always will remain. It’s like a good movie, the legacy after many years. That we are still talking about him like a good movie or a good book is because he was so good.“I think Pelé, Maradona, Cruyff, Messi, Beckenbauer, Cristiano Ronaldo – these type of players will be forever, they will be eternal.”Frank Lampard, the former England and Chelsea midfielder who is now manager of Everton, recognised the enormous impact Pelé had in the game. Lampard, 44, said: “There’s huge respect for him as a player and as a person, as all the responses since yesterday have shown. He was a great man as well as a great player. He was one of the greatest without doubt.“The reach of his name in the game was obviously huge. It just gets bigger with age. We have lost him unfortunately but his name will continue for evermore because of his impact on the game.”The Tottenham manager, Antonio Conte, said when he was young his father had told him all about Pelé. “The first person who spoke to me about Pelé was my father. My father was in love with Pelé because for him, he was the best player in the world and many times he spoke about him. Then I watched some games that he played and especially the final of the World Cup and [in] some situations it was incredible what he did with the ball.“If I have to compare Pelé with Maradona, it is different because about Pelé I listened, I had my father and I watched through the TV his quality and that he was an amazing player. About Maradona, I had the opportunity to play against him. Then to see and to touch his ability. But I repeat, Pelé for my father was the best footballer in the world.”Players will wear black armbands while there will be a minute’s applause prior to kick-off at all Premier League and EFL games this weekend.","['played in every generation', 'When I was nine, 10 I started to watch some games,', 'Now I realise how strong he could do everything.

The American businessman’s company Black Knight Football Club has taken 100% ownership.Foley will assume the role of chairman and is due to attend the next home match, against Crystal Palace on New Year’s Eve. He owns and founded ice hockey’s Vegas Golden Knights and his takeover means that more than half the Premier League’s clubs have minority or majority US shareholders.“We will move forward with an ‘always advance, never retreat’ approach that has defined all of my endeavours,” Foley said. “I am committed to work with the best football and business minds available to enhance player development, facilities and the fan experience to put AFC Bournemouth in the best possible position to succeed.”Foley is the managing general partner of Black Knight, where minority owners include the American actor Michael B Jordan and Nullah Sarker, who is involved with tennis’s Davis Cup. Bournemouth said Jordan and Nullah would work closely with Foley “in areas including global marketing and internationalisation of the club”.Demin exits after 11 years as owner and with Bournemouth 14th in the top flight, having overseen a rise from League One.The takeover means 11 Premier League clubs have US shareholders: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Bournemouth, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and West Ham.Bournemouth said: “Bill is committed to increased investment in AFC Bournemouth’s first team as well as the academy and fan experience at Vitality Stadium, on top of immediately beginning construction of a state-of-the-art training centre and increasing financial commitment to the AFC Bournemouth women’s team and girls’ teams.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballBlack Knight is 50.1% owned by Cannae Holdings, of which Foley is the chairman.","['We will move forward with an ‘always advance, never retreat’ approach that has defined all of my endeavours,', 'I am committed to work with the best football and business minds available to enhance player development, facilities and the fan experience to put AFC Bournemouth in the best possible position to succeed.', 'in areas including global marketing and internationalisation of the club', 'Bill is committed to increased investment in AFC Bournemouth’s first team as well as the academy and fan experience at Vitality Stadium, on top of immediately beginning construction of a state-of-the-art training centre and increasing financial commitment to the AFC Bournemouth women’s team and girls’ teams.']",
Charlton aiming to escape valley of gloom in Manchester United cup clash,The Guardian,Ed Aarons,2023-01-09,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/09/charlton-manchester-united-carabao-cup-gloom-takeover,"Carabao Cup quarter-final comes amid prospective takeover of club that pays to use its stadium and training groundFor Charlton supporters who grew up during the club’s most recent spell in the Premier League, the past 15 years have not been kind. A series of disastrous takeovers after relegation in 2007 sent the Addicks into freefall that has them languishing halfway down League One and facing an even more uncertain future under potentially yet another group of owners.“Charlton is the most underperforming club in the country,” says Rick Everitt, the editor of fanzine Voice of the Valley since 1988. “That’s not to say that it should automatically be in the Premier League, although obviously it has that potential, but it should certainly be mid-table in the Championship, if it was decently run.”The Danish-American owner Thomas Sandgaard, who bought the club in 2020 from East Street Investments, is believed to have granted a period of exclusivity to a consortium led by the former Sunderland executive Charlie Methven a few days before the surprise shootout victory over Brighton in the last round of the Carabao Cup on 21 December. That was the first time Charlton had beaten Premier League opposition since March 2007 and set up Tuesday’s trip to Manchester United in the quarter-final, with 9,000 fans expected to make the journey.Methven – who has been spotted at Charlton’s past two matches with his consortium partner Simon Lenagan, the son of the Wigan rugby league chairman, Ian – is understood to have recommended the appointment of the manager, Dean Holden, until the end of the season after December’s sacking of Ben Garner. However, the technical director, Andy Scott, has been given only a six-week contract until the end of the January transfer window.Sandgaard, criticised by supporters for appointing his son, Martin, as director of analytics, is aiming to sell 80% of his Charlton shares for about £11m, although they do not include freeholds for the Valley or the club’s Sparrows Lane training ground. Both are owned by the previous owner Roland Duchâtelet, with the Belgian charging £500,000 a season for his former club to rent their home and the training ground under the agreement he struck with ESI.“The biggest problem is that ESI in early 2020 allowed Duchâtelet to separate the liabilities of the football club from the assets, namely the Valley and Sparrows Lane,” says Everitt. “It is a return to the same problem we had in the 1980s and that was always going to be dangerous. Duchâtelet has no particular incentive to cooperate in any bid to put the football club back on a sound footing – he wants £50m and people that are seriously interested in Charlton won’t buy them without the freehold and they are not worth half that.“Duchâtelet wasted a lot of money. And he wants that money back. The fans humiliated him and some people think he wants revenge. I don’t necessarily think he does.”Sandgaard’s Colarado-based business Clear Ocean Capital is believed to have provided up to £12m in loans to Charlton since his takeover, with the club expecting to post a £6m operating loss this year. There remains scepticism among supporters that he will simply walk away from his investment or that the prospective new owners can provide a long-term solution.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“I think the experience of the last 10 years has battered the Charlton supporters into a position where they’re going to be sceptical about anyone coming forward and probably wisely,” Everitt says. “But equally there is a risk that people get too cynical about other people’s motives.”Everitt feels Sandgaard has been unrealistic from the beginning: “I think he’s a decent enough guy. I think he was well-intentioned but he was naive and like all of the people who have come in, he thought having had success elsewhere he would be able to turn the club around relatively easily and he’s been sadly disillusioned.”Sandgaard was not at the Brighton game having flown back to the United States that day after speaking to staff. It remains to be seen whether he will be at Old Trafford as a youthful side led by the teenage striker, Miles Leaburn, son of Charlton legend Carl, attempt to lighten the gloom amid all the uncertainty.“It’s great for the younger fans – Charlton haven’t had an opportunity to go to one of the more famous grounds for many years,” says Everitt. “Everyone at the club needs this kind of occasion just to remind ourselves what it’s all about and to take 9,000 to Old Trafford on a Tuesday night speaks to the fact that there is still a very solid fanbase if we get things right on the pitch in the medium term.”","['Charlton is the most underperforming club in the country,', 'That’s not to say that it should automatically be in the Premier League, although obviously it has that potential, but it should certainly be mid-table in the Championship, if it was decently run.', 'The biggest problem is that ESI in early 2020 allowed Duchâtelet to separate the liabilities of the football club from the assets, namely the Valley and Sparrows Lane,', 'It is a return to the same problem we had in the 1980s and that was always going to be dangerous.

"Title race, battle for top four and relegation scrap: the Premier League is back",The Guardian,"Jamie Jackson, Andy Hunter and Ben Fisher",2022-12-23,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/23/title-race-battle-for-top-four-and-relegation-scrap-the-premier-league-is-back,"As the English top flight returns after the World Cup we look at how the teams shape up going into the season’s second halfWhen Premier League festivities resume on Boxing Day the smart money is on Arsenal and Manchester City slugging it out for the title until May in what could be a contest for the ages. Leading their sides in a classic master-apprentice matchup is City’s near-peerless manager, Pep Guardiola, and his former assistant and now Arsenal No 1, Mikel Arteta.The tale of the tape thus far is fascinating. Arteta’s pretenders are the young thrusters who have a five-point lead but could be without Gabriel Jesus until February. Their goal count is 33 with 11 conceded, the division’s joint lowest, and in captain Martin Ødegaard (who is 24), Bukayo Saka (21), Gabriel Martinelli (21), Ben White (25), Aaron Ramsdale (24) and William Saliba (21) Arsenal have an effervescent core being led by the vibrant Arteta.Guardiola’s seasoned campaigners are reigning champions, have scored a division-high 40, and their 18-goal phenomenon Erling Haaland enjoyed six weeks off before returning to score against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup. City have plundered four of the last five Premier League titles and Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish are some of their other headline acts.In this World Cup-interrupted season both sides have played 14 games but are yet to meet. Keep 15 February and 26 April in the diary free for City’s visit to the Emirates and the reverse fixture to watch how each will hope to unpick the other plus, of course, the riveting sideshow of two animated managers trying to maintain cool on the touchline.Viewers of Arsenal’s All or Nothing, which took in last term, were offered an insight into Arteta’s at times left-field methods (a floating lightbulb featured in one team talk) and wholly likable persona. They will be impressed at how his team have gone from the late-season collapse that ended in a fifth-place finish, featured in the Amazon documentary, to this season’s apparent real deal. Arsenal’s sole reverse has been at Manchester United and they have dropped only two points since.City have two defeats on the card. November’s fractious 1-0 downing by Liverpool at Anfield in which Jürgen Klopp was sent off. And Brentford’s smash-and-grab 2-1 win at Etihad Stadium in their final outing before the Qatar 2022 cessation.Five points is not a massive margin but it indicates an Arsenal side who are not going anywhere between now and the spring months when the championship is decided. Newcastle United, a further two points behind City, and Tottenham (three), may believe they can still force themselves into the contest but realistically this seems destined to unfold as a storybook toe-to-toe of two prizefighters: the side who were last England’s best in 2004 and the current holders.Only three Premier League teams have broken the usual suspects’ vice-like grip on Champions League qualification in the past 20 years – Leicester, when winning the title in 2016, Everton in 2005 and Newcastle in 2003 (only the top three in England qualified when they finished fourth in 2001-02). It is St James’ Park that houses the biggest threat to the closed shop once again. History may suggest otherwise, but on pre-World Cup form the odds must be firmly on Eddie Howe delivering a top-four finish in the first full season since the money started flowing in from Saudi Arabia.Taking the title race as a shootout between Arsenal and Manchester City – and Newcastle may beg to differ given their winning streak before the break – six teams are left challenging for the remaining two Champions League spots, from Howe’s side in third to a plummeting Chelsea in eighth. Newcastle, who resume their league campaign at Leicester on Boxing Day, have presented the strongest case for inclusion by far in a season when they have lost once in all competitions and won seven of eight league games prior to the World Cup. There could be no clearer statement about their credentials than the performance that secured the 2-1 win at Tottenham.Fourth-placed Spurs remain in contention but were faltering before the World Cup. Antonio Conte was left in no doubt as to the misgivings over his style among supporters during a run of three defeats in five league games, with a Carabao Cup exit at Nottingham Forest thrown in for bad measure. Harry Kane’s laboured performances in Qatar and the burden carried by Son Heung-min will be an added cause for concern. Richarlison’s elavated status and self-belief after a fine campaign with Brazil offers the counterbalance.Graham Potter has greater problems across London having made an underwhelming start to his Chelsea reign. The 2021 European champions find themselves eight points adrift of fourth place, albeit with a game in hand on Spurs, having not won a Premier League game since 16 October. New co-owner Todd Boehly may already be sweating on his investment and decision-making.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballPotter’s former club Brighton are level on points with his new one but, despite an excellent recruitment strategy that was showcased on the World Cup stage, strength in depth may count against a sustained challenge over the next five months. All of which points to a potential duel between Manchester United and Liverpool for the golden ticket their respective US owners have, at various times in their tenure, taken as read. United are now unburdened from the Cristiano Ronaldo saga. Liverpool had just started to click again when the league paused and have a habit of finishing strongly under Klopp.But they are all playing catchup to the growing threat from the north-east.At this time of year there are usually a handful of teams particularly short of festive cheer having swallowed the statistic that only three clubs bottom at Christmas have escaped the drop since the Premier League’s inception 30 years ago, Leicester the last to do so in 2014-15. But the picture is a little skewed this season – teams have played a couple of games fewer at this stage than in years gone by – and the World Cup break provided the perfect opportunity to reset, reinvigorate and, as the modern-day manager will almost certainly testify, get on the grass with their players.A nine-point blanket covers 11 teams from ninth-placed Fulham to bottom club Wolves. If anything, perhaps those that head into Boxing Day in the relegation zone will be more optimistic than a couple above the dotted line. Julen Lopetegui will take charge of his first league game with Wolves at Everton on Monday, with his arrival at the centre of the restructuring that has brought a new sporting director and, they hope, Matheus Cunha as the first of several new faces in the January window.Southampton, too, are hoping for an uplift under Nathan Jones after one win from their past 10 league matches, the worst run in the division. Nottingham Forest’s fortunes turned with victory against Liverpool in October – they have lost once since, at leaders Arsenal – and a move to a more pragmatic approach is paying off. Evangelos Marinakis spent around £150m in the summer and Gustavo Scarpa, a free agent who this month became their 23rd signing of the season, is unlikely to be the last through the door at the City Ground.Forest are not the only team with grand plans. Unai Emery was not attracted to Aston Villa by the lure of a relegation battle and Leicester, after an ominous start, will hope to continue making headway under Brendan Rodgers after four wins from their past five games. The heat is on for Frank Lampard at Everton and for David Moyes at West Ham, with both teams a point above the bottom three after a worrying run before the break.Bournemouth, the 10th top-flight club under American ownership after the billionaire Bill Foley’s £120m takeover, are also determined to make a splash. The 78-year-old Foley, who recently described himself as a dictator, said he knows his aggressive approach to business could irk rivals. “I’m not here to make friends with other team owners,” he said, with Bournemouth targeting up to five new signings after giving Gary O’Neil the manager’s job.","['I’m not here to make friends with other team owners,']"," “I’m not here to make friends with other team owners,” he said, with Bournemouth targeting up to five new signings after giving Gary O’Neil the manager’s job"

‘Not good enough’: Graham Potter’s verdict on Chelsea’s first half at Forest,The Guardian,Peter Lansley at the City Ground,2023-01-01,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/01/graham-potter-chelsea-not-good-enough-first-half-nottingham-forest-concerned,"Graham Potter has admitted that Chelsea’s first-half performance was “not good enough” in the 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest.Chelsea have picked up 15 points from Potter’s 10 Premier League games and the head coach criticised the pace of his players’ passing and movement as they failed to build on Raheem Sterling’s opener. He refused to accept that Chelsea had been “bullied” by Forest, however, as the promoted team came from behind to deserve the point gained by Serge Aurier’s second-half equaliser.Potter said of the first half: “Our performance level wasn’t good enough to take the three points. We didn’t move the ball fast enough, [and there was] not enough movement.“When the game became a bit more out of control [in the second half] we suffered with the duels and struggled to deal with that aspect. It’s a tough game; Forest played a good game but we’re disappointed with our performance over the 90 minutes and concerned we didn’t deserve the win. It would have been unfair [for us] to take the three points.”Chelsea were missing Reece James, out for three to four weeks with a recurrence of the knee injury that ruled him out of the World Cup, Wesley Fofana (knee), Ruben Loftus-Cheek (calf), Ben Chilwell (hamstring), N’Golo Kanté (hamstring) and Édouard Mendy (shoulder).Nottingham Forest are investigating reports of homophobic chanting by some of their fans during Sunday’s Premier League game against Chelsea.Chelsea’s official LGBTQ+ supporters group tweeted towards the end of the first half to “totally condemn” the chant it said could be heard at the City Ground, during a match shown live on Sky Sports.Forest said in a statement shortly after full time: “The club are aware of reports concerning chants aimed at Chelsea supporters from a minority of fans this evening and do not condone any type of discriminatory or offensive behaviour. The matter will be investigated.”Chelsea Pride earlier tweet read: “We totally condemn the Chelsea Rent Boy chant that can be heard at the City Ground. Time to call this out the game is live on @SkySportsPL This is now classed as a hate crime.”Forest’s LGBTQ+ group said it was embarrassed and ashamed by the abuse and apologised on behalf of those responsible. A tweet from LGBTQ+ Trickies read: “From all genuine #NFFC fans, please accept our apologies, not only do we hope @NottPolFootball will do their best to take action, we would hope @NFFC release a statement condoning [sic] this and take necessary action. We are embarrassed and ashamed."" PA MediaReinforcements are coming, with a £32.7m fee agreed for Monaco’s centre-back Benoît Badiashile and the striker David Datro Fofana signed from Molde for £8m. Chelsea are pursuing the Benfica midfield anchorman Erno Fernández, who has a £106m release clause.Potter was frustrated with his team but praised the way Forest, roused by their raucous home following, made the game a battle. “Credit Nottingham Forest,” he said. “They are here [in the Premier League] for the first time in ages, celebrating everything, and rightly so. They have to use their advantages, which is the environment, the crowd. The second half, we didn’t control it well enough.“I think we stood up today though. The effort was there. But away from home teams are not going to make it easy. [Opposing] players are asking [to exchange] shirts and we have to be humble enough to know that’s what we’re up against. [I’d] run through a brick wall to say: ‘I am going to be good enough to play for Chelsea.’”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballCooper was pleased with the way his team got up to the press with greater cohesion in the second half as they deservedly extended their unbeaten home run to six matches before they visit Southampton, bottom of the table, on Wednesday. Jesse Lingard, however, will be missing for a month with a hamstring injury.This was the first time Forest have gained a point after going behind. “We should be pleased we were the better team and we should’ve won,” Cooper said. “But we didn’t. We will take the learnings from it.“It’s step by step. We’ll never look too far ahead. We have Southampton now who have had an extra rest day more than us and we have to travel there.

Hamlin gives 'perspective' on sport's dangers - Reuters,Reuters,,2023-01-03,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/hamlin-gives-perspective-sports-dangers-2023-01-03/,"Jan 3 (Reuters) - The global sporting community rallied around Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin on Tuesday after he suffered a cardiac arrest during Monday's National Football League (NFL) game against the Cincinnati Bengals and was in critical condition.Players stood stunned with tears in their eyes as medical officials performed CPR on the 24-year-old in the middle of the field, an incident that horrified fans and prompted the NFL to postpone the game.Seven-times Super Bowl winner Tom Brady said on social media that the moment ""put into perspective what it means to play this game we love"".For competitors from other disciplines who suffered their own life-threatening injuries, Hamlin was a jarring reminder of how vulnerable athletes can be.""Prayers that Damar Hamlin can have the same outcome that I was fortunate to have with my incident,"" retired National Hockey League (NHL) defenceman Chris Pronger wrote on Twitter.Pronger, who collected two Olympic gold medals for Canada, collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest when a slap shot hit him in the chest at the 1998 Stanley Cup playoffs. He was able to continue his career, playing for more than a decade after recovering from the incident.""Our thoughts and prayers go out to Damar, his family, teammates and the greater NFL community during this incredibly scary time,"" he added.Others have been less fortunate.Former Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba was forced to retire at the age of 24 after collapsing on the pitch in an FA Cup match in 2012 and being technically ""dead"" for 78 minutes. The match was abandoned.He was saved in part by the intervention of an off-duty heart specialist in the crowd who used a defibrillator to revive the player's heart, leading to a campaign to have more of the emergency devices made available at sports clubs and public places.In January last year, he said he was worried by the prospect of Christian Eriksen returning to the Premier League, following the Denmark international's cardiac arrest on the pitch at the European Championship in 2021.Eriksen collapsed in the 42nd minute of a Euro 2020 match against Finland and was later taken to hospital. He was then fitted with a special heart-starting device known as an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD).The 30-year-old was forced to terminate his contract with Inter Milan in December 2021 because footballers fitted with an ICD are not permitted to play in Italy's Serie A. He has since played for Brentford and Manchester United.Almost two hours after he left the field, the Denmark v Finland game resumed, taking place in an understandably subdued atmosphere as Finland won 1-0.Players and the Danish coach later complained that UEFA had offered them the option of resuming that evening or beginning again the following lunch time.UEFA defended their decision, saying they acted with utmost respect and ordered the restart after consultation with the players.In 2003, midfielder Marc-Vivien Foe collapsed in the 72nd minute of Cameroon's 1-0 victory against Colombia in a Confederations Cup match in Lyon, France and died shortly afterwards.Medics spent 45 minutes trying to restart Foe's heart before he was pronounced dead. His autopsy found the Olympique Lyonnais player suffered from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a hereditary condition which increases the risk of collapse during exercise.In cycling, Belgian rider Michael Goolaerts died after suffering a cardiac arrest during the Paris-Roubaix cycling classic in 2018.Canadian-born Italian ice hockey player Darcy Robinson died after suffering a heart attack and passing out during a top-flight match in Italy in 2007.Australian cricketer Philip Hughes died two days after being struck in the head by a ball while batting in a domestic match in 2014.

Gianluca Vialli obituary,The Guardian,Peter Mason,2023-01-06,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/06/gianluca-vialli-obituary,"Dynamic, intelligent forward for Chelsea, Juventus, Sampdoria and Italy who became the first Italian to manage a top-flight English football clubGianluca Vialli, who has died of pancreatic cancer aged 58, became the first Italian to manage a top-flight English football club when he took over at Chelsea in 1998, guiding them to FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners’ Cup trophies. However, he will be better remembered for his playing career as a dynamic, intelligent and versatile forward at Sampdoria and Juventus, as well as for Italy, with whom he won 59 caps between 1985 and 1992.During a lengthy sojourn at Sampdoria in the 1980s and early 90s, Vialli won various honours, including the Italian League and the European Cup Winners’ Cup, but it was during his later, shorter stay at Juventus that he hit the greatest heights, captaining the side to a Champions League title in 1996.Moving on to Chelsea immediately afterwards, he became a well-liked figure in west London, graduating from player to player-manager and then solely to manager – until, in the modern Chelsea tradition, he was sacked while still in full flow. A year followed as manager of Watford, after which he decided to concentrate on other interests, including television work and a backroom job with the Italian national side.Vialli had an unusually wealthy background for a footballer. Born in Cremona in northern Italy, he was raised with his four older siblings in a huge 14th-century castle in the village of Belgioioso, not far from Milan, which had been bought by his father, a self-made millionaire.In 1980, at the age of 16, he signed for his local club, Cremonese, in the third tier of the league, and four years later was bought by the Genoese Serie A team Sampdoria, who paired him up front with Roberto Mancini. Together they became known as the “goal twins” for their scoring exploits, as Sampdoria, who had won nothing of note up to that point, suddenly became a force in the Italian game.Vialli’s first winner’s medal came in the Italian Cup in 1985, and under the Yugoslavian manager Vujadin Boškov he won another two cup finals, in 1988 and 1989, before appearing in the 1990 European Cup Winners’ Cup final, a 2-0 win against Anderlecht in which he scored both goals in extra time.That year, Vialli also featured in the 1990 World Cup finals in Italy. He was dropped after missing a penalty in the second match against the USA, but returned for Italy’s semi-final against Argentina, which they lost on penalties.A year later Sampdoria won the Serie A championship for the first and only time, finishing a comfortable five points clear of Internazionale at the end of the 1990-91 season, thanks in part to Vialli’s 19 goals as top scorer in the league. Qualifying for the European Cup, they reached the final at Wembley in 1992, but lost 1-0 to Barcelona in extra time, Vialli uncharacteristically missing three good chances before Ronald Koeman scored the winner.Shortly afterwards he accepted an offer to join Juventus for a world-record fee of £12.5m, ushering in the end of Sampdoria’s great era of achievement. In Turin he won the 1993 Uefa Cup during his first season and then, under a new manager, Marcello Lippi, captained the side to a double of the 1994-95 Italian championship and the Italian Cup, creating another formidable goalscoring combination with Fabrizio Ravanelli in a side that also boasted Roberto Baggio, Alessandro Del Piero and Andreas Möller.The crowning glory of his four-year spell at Juventus was victory in the 1996 Champions League final at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, where he lifted the trophy as captain after a win on penalties against Ajax.By then in his early 30s, Vialli decided on a final move to the Premier League with Chelsea. He soon became a popular presence at Stamford Bridge, helped by his excellent command of English and use of colloquialisms, as well as his suave but likable aura.He won the 1997 FA Cup in his first year at the club, but was limited to five minutes off the bench in the 2-0 win over Middlesbrough in the final, and for much of his time under manager Ruud Gullit he found his place in the side was hardly guaranteed.When Gullit was sacked unexpectedly in early 1998, Vialli took over as player-manager, handing out glasses of champagne in the dressing room before his first match in charge, a League Cup semi-final second-leg win against Arsenal. That took them to the final, where they again beat Middlesbrough 2-0.Having landed his first managerial honours within weeks of taking charge, Vialli also inherited a decent position in the European Cup Winners’ Cup, taking his side from the quarter-finals to the final and beating Stuttgart 1-0 in Stockholm to become, at the time, the youngest manager to win a European competition.Third position in the Premier League at the end of the following 1998-99 season was Chelsea’s best showing in the top flight since 1970, and after stepping down as a player to concentrate solely on management, by the finish of 1999-2000 he had steered them to an FA Cup final win against Aston Villa and fifth place in the league. However, only five games into the next campaign, the club dispensed with his services.Vialli’s subsequent move to manage Watford, who had just dropped out of the Premier League, was not nearly so successful. After a season in which the club finished 14th in the First Division he was sacked, prompting a lengthy legal dispute over substantial payments he said were due for the rest of his contract.That was enough to put him off management for good, and he moved instead into work as a television analyst and commentator, mainly for Sky Italia. He also set up a sports investment company, Tifosy, and in 2019 was appointed delegation chief for the Italy team under his friend Mancini, a behind-the-scenes position he held until his death in London, where he had lived since his Chelsea days.He is survived by his wife, Cathryn White-Cooper, whom he married in 2003, two daughters, Olivia and Sofia, his mother, Maria Teresa, his brothers, Nino, Marco and Maffo, and his sister, Mila.

Safety body to review overcrowding reports at FA Cup tie at Hillsborough,The Guardian,PA Media,2023-01-10,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/10/sheffield-wednesday-newcastle-overcrowding-hillsborough-sports-grounds-safety-authority,"The Sports Grounds Safety Authority (SGSA) has announced a review into reports of overcrowding at Hillsborough during Sheffield Wednesday’s FA Cup tie against Newcastle.The organisation, which issues safety licences to Premier League and EFL grounds and advises the UK government on safety at sporting stadia, said it was “concerned” by reports of overcrowding at the third-round tie on Saturday.A number of fans in the away end alleged there were congestion issues around the exit to the tunnel in the Leppings Lane End before the 6pm (GMT) kick-off. There were also reports on social media of a lack of stewarding and some fans ripping out security screening to give themselves more room.“We are concerned by reports of overcrowding and crushing at the FA Cup tie between Sheffield Wednesday and Newcastle United at Hillsborough Stadium on Saturday evening,” a spokesperson for the SGSA said.“The SGSA is now working with the club, Sheffield city council and the Safety Advisory Group to review the event, learn any lessons and ensure a safe environment for football fans.”Peter Scarfe, who runs the Hillsborough Survivors Support Alliance, was at the FA Cup semi-final in 1989 where 97 football fans died after a crush in the Leppings Lane End. He feels the scenes at the same ground on Saturday showed lessons have not been learned and warned of “history repeating itself”.Scarfe said: “Grounds now are about standing and rail seating and you kind of think this wouldn’t happen any more but it seems to in Sheffield. It is a disaster waiting to happen. Nearly 34 years of experience and research and mistakes to learn from, and they just obviously haven’t.”The Football Association is to speak to officials from both clubs about the incident, while the Newcastle United Supporters Trust has also appealed for information. Sheffield Wednesday have been approached for comment by the PA Media.","['concerned', 'We are concerned by reports of overcrowding and crushing at the FA Cup tie between Sheffield Wednesday and Newcastle United at Hillsborough Stadium on Saturday evening,', 'The SGSA is now working with the club, Sheffield city council and the Safety Advisory Group to review the event, learn any lessons and ensure a safe environment for football fans.', 'history repeating itself', 'Grounds now are about standing and rail seating and you kind of think this wouldn’t happen any more but it seems to in Sheffield.

Factbox: Cristiano Ronaldo joins Al Nassr: what we know of the ... - Reuters,Reuters,,2022-12-31,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/cristiano-ronaldo-joins-al-nassr-what-we-know-portugal-forwards-new-saudi-2022-12-31/,"Dec 31 (Reuters) - Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo has joined Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr on a 2-1/2 year deal, a month after the 37-year-old forward became a free agent when his contract with Premier League club Manchester United was terminated.Here is what you need to know about the club:* Formed in 1955, Al Nassr is based in the Saudi capital of Riyadh and the club plays in the country's top division - the Saudi Professional League (SPL), which has 18 teams.* It finished third last season, six points behind champions Al Hilal.* Al Nassr are the second-most successful team in the league with nine titles. Their last win was in the 2018-19 season. Only Al Hilal, also based in Riyadh, have won more titles (18).* They have also won the country's knockout cup, the King's Cup, six times, most recently in 1990.* The league's all-time top scorer Majed Abdullah played for Al Nassr. The former Saudi striker scored 189 goals and averaged nearly a goal a game.* Al Nassr's home ground is Mrsool Park, which has a capacity of 25,000.* Al Nassr's best performance in Asia's premier club competition, the AFC Champions League, came in 1995 when they finished runners-up.* Saudi teams have won the AFC Champions League six times, with Al Hilal claiming a record four titles while Al Ittihad won the continental competition twice.* Al Nassr are coached by Rudi Garcia, who previously managed Lille, AS Roma, Olympique Marseille and Olympique Lyonnais. The Frenchman has been in charge since June.* SPL clubs can register eight foreign players but only seven can be named in a matchday squad.* Other notable foreign players in the squad include Cameroon's World Cup hero Vincent Aboubakar - who changed the game against Serbia and scored the winner to stun Brazil in their last group game in Qatar.* Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina, who previously played for Arsenal and Napoli, as well as former Brazil international and midfielder Luiz Gustavo are also in the squad.* Al Nassr are second in the league this season after 10 rounds, two points behind leaders Al Shabab.* They must win the league this season to qualify for the 2023–24 AFC Champions League.* Ronaldo has scored over 700 goals in club football and over 100 in international football to sit top of the all-time scoring charts with 819 strikes.* Despite United's struggles last season, an ageing Ronaldo showed he still had some gas left in the tank when he finished top scorer with 24 goals, including 18 in the Premier League.* But he struggled this season at United, scoring only three times in all competitions before his exit.* In Qatar, he became the first player to score in five World Cups but he soon lost his place in the starting lineup after Portugal reached the knockout stages.* Scoring goals has not been a problem for Al Nassr this season, however, with the team netting a joint league-high 24 goals after 10 games - the same as leaders Al Shabab.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.India captain Rohit Sharma said he withdrew a 'Mankad' run-out appeal against Dasun Shanaka in Tuesday's one-day international as that was not how they envisioned dismissing the Sri Lankan skipper, who scored a century in a game his team could not win.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

Newcastle climb to second after Almirón and Joelinton sink Leicester,The Guardian,Peter Lansley at the King Power Stadium,2022-12-26,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/26/leicester-newcastle-premier-league-match-report,"Not even the World Cup break looks like slowing Newcastle’s pursuit of Champions League football and, as Eddie Howe’s team climbed into second place in the Premier League, Brendan Rodgers even suggested they should “absolutely” be considered title contenders.Early goals from Chris Wood, from the penalty spot, Miguel Almirón and Joelinton brought Newcastle a sixth successive league win against one of the division’s previous in-form teams, for whom the six-week international break in Qatar clearly came at a bad time.The teams meet again in the Carabao Cup quarter-final in a fortnight but, with a trip to Arsenal, the leaders, next Tuesday, Newcastle’s priorities may have moved beyond one-off silverware by then. “We can do anything,” Howe said. “The season is still young enough for all possibilities to exist for us. I want the fans to believe we can do anything.”While the Newcastle manager was more restrained in his briefing with the written media, his Leicester counterpart believes there is no reason why they cannot compete for the title. “Absolutely,” Rodgers said. “Having watched them through this season, and today, obviously they have got that hunger to be there, with a point to prove. Making a good start gives you the belief you can stay there. They’ve signed top players … and got some great results.“There’s no reason why they can’t be [involved in the title discussion] and if they can make the right additions in January, so they have cover for certain players, and keep players fit, then with the fanatical fanbase up there, they can have a great chance.”Rodgers criticised his players for their slow start to the game – “Our attitude was really poor” – and now has to contend for a longer period without James Maddison, the subject of a £40m bid from Newcastle last summer, who has suffered a setback from the knee injury that curtailed his involvement with England in Qatar.Leicester’s form going into the World Cup had actually been as brilliant as Newcastle’s; they also averaged two points a game after they had been bottom with one point from their first eight games. But it was Howe’s team who picked up where they had left off as they went 2-0 up inside seven minutes.Euphoric chants of “We’re going to win the league” rang out from the black and white corner of the King Power Stadium as Newcastle responded to the disappointment of losing Callum Wilson to illness by seeing Wood, his replacement, fire them into the lead after Daniel Amartey tripped Joelinton in the area after 85 seconds.The former Leicester striker kept his nerve to smack his penalty straight down the middle – none of this waiting to see where the goalkeeper is going – for his third goal of the season. The centre of defence is one area in Leicester’s squad Rodgers is keen to replenish come the opening of the transfer window next week but they were too easily opened up all over throughout the first half.Luke Thomas was too accommodating as Almirón received a long pass out wide and cut back inside on to his favoured left foot before playing a one-two with Bruno Guimarães and steering home his ninth goal of the season, equalling his tally for the previous four campaigns, with his left foot.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballTo add injury to insult, Leicester lost Danielennis Praet, Maddison’s deputy, in the 17th minute, but as they briefly played their way back into the game in the middle of the pitch. Patson Daka was unlucky not to pull a goal back when he nicked the ball past Nick Pope but fell as the ball rebounded off him but not over the line.Newcastle went 3-0 up in the 32nd minute for the first time in an away game in the Premier League in 15 years when Joelinton rose above Boubakary Soumaré to head home Kieran Trippier’s corner.Wood could have made the half-time scoreline even more embarrassing but he lofted Joe Willock’s pullback on to the top of the net just before the break.It was no surprise when Jamie Vardy was summoned from the substitutes’ bench for the second half as Leicester sought a way back into the game. Rodgers made some tactical changes as he paired Vardy and Harvey Barnes up front, with Ayoze Pérez playing in a No 10 role, and was able to make some inroads in behind Dan Burn down Newcastle’s left. But the nearest they came to getting a goal back came when Sven Botman’s clearance ricocheted off Burn for a corner.Now four points above the relegation zone, Leicester head to Liverpool on Friday.","['absolutely', 'We can do anything,', 'The season is still young enough for all possibilities to exist for us.

Frank Lampard to remain in charge of Everton for FA Cup amid serious doubts,The Guardian,Andy Hunter,2023-01-04,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/frank-lampard-to-remain-in-charge-of-everton-for-fa-cup-amid-serious-doubts,"Frank Lampard will be in charge of Everton for their FA Cup third-round tie at Manchester United on Friday amid doubts over his long-term future at Goodison Park.The Everton manager is under severe pressure following a run of eight defeats in 11 matches in all competitions and one win from 10 Premier League games.After the latest, a shambolic 4-1 home defeat by Brighton on Tuesday, Lampard said a decision on his future was beyond his control with Everton hovering one point and one place above the relegation zone. They dropped into the bottom three after results on Wednesday night.Lampard arrived at Everton’s Finch Farm training complex early on Wednesday morning and took a warm-down training session as planned in the afternoon. His press conference to preview the FA Cup tie will also go ahead as scheduled on Thursday.The 44-year-old held talks with the director of football, Kevin Thelwell, and chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, at Finch Farm, although that was part of a pre-planned visit by the pair and it is the club’s owner, Farhad Moshiri, who will ultimately decide whether to seek the eighth permanent manager of his chaotic tenure.Lampard is acutely aware he needs a reaction at Old Trafford, and to avoid a repeat of the heavy defeat against Brighton, to buy time before two critical league games against fellow strugglers Southampton and West Ham.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballThere is an acceptance at Everton that the team’s forward options must be improved this month, with Richarlison sold in the summer, Dominic Calvert-Lewin restricted to six starts this season by injury and new signings Neal Maupay and Dwight McNeil failing to have an effect.The dreadful run of results, however, that culminated in fans turning on the board and their own players at Goodison on Tuesday, has cast doubt on how much longer Lampard will have to work with any new signings with Everton ensconced in another relegation battle.",[],
Football Daily | Debates citing the FA Cup losing its magic have lost their magic,The Guardian,Barry Glendenning,2023-01-09,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/09/football-daily-email-fa-cup-third-round,"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!It’s more than 22 years since the FA emotionally blackmailed defending champions Manchester United into withdrawing from the FA Cup so they could play in the inaugural Fifa World Club Championship in Brazil. The thinking behind this wheeze was that United’s expedition into the unknown would boost England’s chances of hosting the 2006 World Cup, a tournament that ultimately ended up being staged in Germany, possibly because the only team United managed to beat in Brazil were the Antipodean semi-professionals of South Melbourne.In the intervening decades, debate has raged over whether or not that was the point at which the FA Cup started to lose its magic and exactly how much magic it has lost. So much so, that we have now reached a point where even once magical sports radio shows regarding the FA Cup losing its magic have long since lost their magic, which meant the tremendous number of upsets – many of them played out in heartwarmingly torrential, sideways rain – thrown up this weekend provided welcome grist for the phone-in mill. Fans of Aston Villa, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth, among other humbled clubs lit up the switchboards to vent their fury about the embarrassing third-round exits inflicted upon their underperforming second-string sides.While League Two Stevenage pulled off what was arguably the giant-killing of the round, coming from behind to beat a Villa team that has somehow failed to make the last 32 for seven consecutive seasons, nouveau riche Welsh side Hollywood FC’s win over potless Coventry was a bona fide classic, while fellow non-league sides Chesterfield and Boreham Wood also punched above their weight in earning replays against more exalted opposition. Indeed, given the number of shocks, it was somewhat ironic that the angriest fans of all were those from out-of-sorts, knack-ravaged Chelsea, whose monstering at Manchester City was one of most predictable, least surprising results in football history. Or at least since Thursday, when the sides met in the league and City only won by a solitary goal. “We have to keep improving and stick together because clearly we are suffering as a football club,” sighed Graham Potter, who had perhaps been hoping for the kind of FA Cup-inspired magical inspiration or intervention more readily associated with his namesake Harry.With 30 games played and just the one postponed, the final match of the third-round schedule takes place on Monday night and it has Football Daily’s Potential Banana Skin klaxon honking like a rogue Arctic walrus on its winter break in Scarborough. While Oxford is more readily associated with scholarship, spires and leafy splendour, its local football team plays in a ground whose only conspicuous landmarks are a car wash and the adjacent Holiday Inn Express.

Golden Goal: Peter Beardsley for Newcastle v Nottingham Forest (1996),The Guardian,Sachin Nakrani,2023-01-05,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/05/golden-goal-peter-beardsley-for-newcastle-v-nottingham-forest-1996,"Ignominy now overshadows Beardsley’s talents as a forward, which he displayed with a stunning strike at the City GroundOf all the iconic moments that have come to define the Premier League era, few stick in the mind quite like that which occurred at Elland Road on Monday 29 April 1996. Title-chasing Newcastle had just beaten Leeds 1-0 and interviewed after the game, their manager, Kevin Keegan, had a few things to get off his chest. He started agitated, got increasingly angry and by the end had turned the volume up to 11.For many, the I will love it rant was pure Keegan, exposing him as a man too emotional for his own good and signalling the precise point that the destiny of the 1995-96 Premier League title race swung away from Newcastle and towards Manchester United.Keegan had allowed Alex Ferguson to get inside his head, rising to the Scot’s bait after he had suggested during the final stage of an epic campaign that Leeds and Nottingham Forest, Newcastle’s third- and second-from-last opponents, would try less hard to beat the north-east side than they had his own. Ever the stirrer, Ferguson claimed Forest in particular would go easy on Newcastle given they were taking part in Stuart Pearce’s testimonial later that year. A favour for a favour, and all that.“You can tell him now, we’re still fighting for this title and he’s got to go to Middlesbrough and get something,” Keegan said, his temperature rising, his finger jabbing. “And I’ll tell you, honestly, I will love it if we beat them. Love it!”United did get something at Middlesbrough; a 3-0 victory that sealed a third championship in four seasons. And really it was a formality given what occurred at the City Ground three days earlier – Newcastle’s 1-1 draw at Forest as the visitors dropped two points having taken a first-half lead. It was a mathematical blow following on from the psychological one Ferguson had landed prior to the Leeds game.The result was a sickener for Newcastle, leaving them two points behind United going into the final day of the season, when as Ferguson’s side toasted glory at the Riverside Stadium, Newcastle were left to stew on what might have been following a 1-1 draw with Tottenham. A 12-point lead frittered away. Geordie dreams ripped at the seams.On that night in the east Midlands, however, Newcastle’s followers at least had something to savour – a goal, one that spoke to the thrilling football they had delivered that season and which fittingly came from the boot of Newcastle’s most creative player during their most creative era. The Entertainers’ best entertainer: Peter Beardsley.It’s difficult to write about Beardsley in light of the 32-week ban from football he received in 2019 after being found guilty of using racist and abusive language towards Newcastle Under-23 players during his time as their coach. It was an upsetting and disgraceful episode and has come to overshadow the fact Beardsley was one hell of a footballer; a technically gifted, highly creative forward who has never truly received the credit he deserved. There are several reasons for that and undoubtedly among them are his appearance and demeanour. That shuffling running style, that pudding-bowl haircut, that thick, lispy Geordie accent; Beardsley is far from the sexiest player this country has ever produced but he is arguably its most talented.A No 10 who rarely played with No 10 on his back, Beardsley’s mastery of a football was beguiling. It rarely left his foot, even as he pulled off his trademark move of dribbling through one challenge after another, often in tight spaces and at speed. As is the case with most talented players, that came from an allying of natural ability with constant practice, which in Beardsley’s case involved running with a ball from his home in Forest Hall to Wallsend Boys Club, the Tyneside youth setup that had a hand in launching not only Beardsley’s career but also those of Steve Bruce, Alan Shearer and Michael Carrick.The ball Beardsley used to dribble with was a penny floater, which for younger readers was made of plastic and had a mind of its own. It was a pain to play with but that was the point as far as Beardsley was concerned: learn to get to grips with one of those and the leather version would be a doddle in comparison.It worked. Beardsley grew up to not only be someone capable of manoeuvring in tight spaces and at speed but also with either foot and from awkward angles. He also had excellent spatial awareness and an often under-appreciated vicious finish. Beardsley may have come across as a dozy dope but there was bloody-mindedness to go with all that talent.And all those gifts were on show at the City Ground on Thursday 2 May 1996 as Newcastle went for title broke against Forest.A little over half an hour had been played when David Batty, standing just inside Forest’s half, fired a pass towards Beardsley, who was lurking outside the area but side-on and with the opposition back four in front of him. Matters were not helped by the ball bouncing as it reached Beardsley, but Newcastle’s captain did not panic. Instead, and in one movement, he seized possession and turned so he was facing towards goal.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballThe ball was high and there were two Forest players, Scott Gemmill and Steve Chettle, moving towards Beardsley as he looked to progress. Again there was no panic as he waited for the ball to drop and, after it had, drove from right to left, brushing off Gemmill and Chettle with ease before poking the ball through Alf-Inge Haaland’s legs and surging into the area.There was still work to do given Haaland’s attempt at a last-ditch tackle, not to mention the fact Beardsley was running away from goal. Once again – no panic. Instead he took a touch to bring the ball under control before lashing a soaring, unstoppable drive past Mark Crossley and into the top corner.“A gem of a goal by a gem of a player,” exclaimed Martin Tyler in commentary, and he wasn’t wrong. The strike was voted Match of the Day’s goal of the month and in the space of five seconds and half a dozen touches, with left and right foot, captured Beardsley at best. Liverpool and Everton supporters may disagree with that assessment given the high-quality displays Beardsley delivered for the Merseyside clubs between the late 80s and the early 90s, while some Newcastle fans would perhaps argue he performed better for their club during his first spell at St James’ Park, from 1983-87. That may all be true but there is no denying that, in the years after he returned to the north-east, Beardsley was a consistently dazzling member of one of the most thrilling teams this country has seen. And what made his contribution to Keegan’s Newcastle especially remarkable was that he was way into his 30s – 35 on the night of the goal against Forest and going on to perform strongly for his boyhood team for a further 15 months.It should also be remembered that as well as being a talented forward in his own right, Beardsley was an excellent foil for others. John Aldridge, Ian Rush, Andy Cole and Les Ferdinand are just some of the strikers who thrived alongside him at club level while with England there was Gary Lineker.“The person that helped me the most was Peter Beardsley,” said the Match of the Day presenter. “Phenomenal player. Unbelievably unselfish. My goalscoring record when Peter was in the England side was pretty much a goal a game and I owe that to him.”Resounding praise for a man whose life has slid into ignominy but who once lit up grounds around the country. None more so than the City Ground in 1996, scoring a goal of technical and brutal beauty amid the crash and burn of his team’s title aspirations.","['You can tell him now, we’re still fighting for this title and he’s got to go to Middlesbrough and get something,', 'And I’ll tell you, honestly, I will love it if we beat them. Love it!', 'A gem of a goal by a gem of a player,', 'The person that helped me the most was Peter Beardsley,', 'Phenomenal player. Unbelievably unselfish.

YouTube’s NFL deal turns up the heat in battle for sports rights,The Guardian,Mark Sweney,2022-12-23,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/dec/23/youtube-nfl-deal-turn-up-heat-battle-for-sports-rights,"Latest incursion by tech giant into territory dominated by broadcasters and pay-TV firms is good news for rights holdersYouTube’s $14bn (£11.6bn) deal to stream National Football League (NFL) games marks the latest incursion by a Silicon Valley giant into territory traditionally dominated by broadcasters and pay-TV companies, as live sport becomes the latest battleground for audiences and profits promised by the streaming revolution.The Google-owned YouTube’s seven-year deal, which will see the world’s largest video platform take over the “Sunday Ticket” package of games held by the US satellite service DirecTV since 1994, followed an auction that included heavy interest from its fellow big tech company Apple.The deal is the latest in a series of commercially eye-popping deals by the NFL, the most expensive live sports rights in the world, after its $113bn, 11-year agreements struck with broadcast partners last year that saw Amazon snap up $1bn worth of games annually.The appetite shown by YouTube, which cements another stratospheric increase in rights value for the NFL, will cheer Premier League bosses hoping a new big spender will reignite the lucrative bidding wars for UK rights that marked the last decade.While the Premier League almost doubled the value of the US rights in a £2bn deal last year with NBC, which is mostly airing matches on its streaming service, Peacock, bosses were forced to roll over a deal with existing partners in the UK to avoid losing potentially hundreds of millions of pounds in an auction lacking new competition.Beyond Sky and BT, the only new player to buy Premier League rights in the UK in recent years has been Amazon, though the Prime Video-owner has not looked to make a knockout bid.While YouTube TV and the recently launched YouTube Primetime Channels, an aggregator of third-party subscription services such as Showtime and Starz akin to Amazon’s offering, are US focused the prospect of the $1.2tn parent company Google going for international sports deals now looms large.“The threat of Google’s free capital entering the rights market is clearly good news for rights sellers worldwide including the Premier League,” says Peter Hutton, the former head of sport at Meta, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.While the global streaming wars have mostly focused on the hundreds of billions being spent on TV series and films in the battle for subscribers, traditional TV companies from Sky and ITV to Comcast, Disney and Paramount in the US have been facing increasing competition for sports rights.Pay-TV and cable companies continue to face budget cuts due to the inexorable decline in subscriber numbers switched off by the high prices for subscription TV packages.Earlier this year Comcast wrote $8.6bn off the value of Sky less than four years after triumphing in a £30bn bidding war for Rupert Murdoch’s pan-European pay-TV empire.Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, played on the organisation’s move to embrace the younger viewers leading the so-called “cord-cutting” of traditional TV in favour of streaming, describing the deal as a “new era … looking towards the future and building the next generation of NFL fans”.Meanwhile, deep-pocketed tech companies such as Facebook and YouTube are diversifying their business models after reporting their first-ever declines in the advertising income on which they have been almost completely reliant.“This is an aggressive move to continue to take more market share from the cable-TV operators,” says Hutton.Earlier this year, Apple agreed a deal worth $2.5bn over 10 years to broadcast US Major League Soccer matches, after an earlier deal with Major League Baseball for Friday games.Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morningMeta has held sports rights in a number of international markets and has previously bid for the hugely popular Indian Premier League cricket rights in India.Amazon continues to invest in an array of rights including tennis, rugby and Champions League football in countries including the UK, Germany and Italy.Even Netflix, which has publicly steadfastly ruled out bidding for live sport, was revealed in November to have looked at rights including the ATP tennis tour, cycling and Women’s Tennis Association as well as looking to buy the World Surf League.This year has seen the seemingly inexorable global streaming boom come to an abrupt end, leading to a focus on costs and profitability, which is curtailing huge budgets on content that may prove to be expensive flops, putting the certainty and predictability of fan loyalty to live sport in the spotlight.At the same time Amazon, Disney and Netflix have also seen the huge success and viewer loyalty that sport-themed content including series such as All or Nothing and Formula One: Drive to Survive can provide.“YouTube’s deal recognises the unique ability of sport to bring a body of fans with it to any service, regardless of delivery technology,” says Hutton. “We’ve seen Warner Bros Discovery invest directly in the Professional Triathletes Organisation this week.“I think we’ll see more of broadcasters and streamers building equity positions in the sports industry where they can.”","['Sunday Ticket', 'The threat of Google’s free capital entering the rights market is clearly good news

"Manchester City look into taking Etihad Stadium capacity to more than 60,000",The Guardian,PA Media,2022-12-12,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/12/manchester-city-expand-etihad-stadium-capacity-more-than-60000,"Manchester City are to explore the possibility of expanding the capacity of the Etihad Stadium to more than 60,000. The Premier League champions have announced they are conducting feasibility studies into a development project that would include building a hotel.The work, if it goes ahead, would make the venue the sixth in the current top flight capable of holding at least 60,000. Old Trafford, the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Emirates Stadium and London Stadium fit that category and work is under way to take Anfield’s capacity to more than 60,000.The Etihad Stadium’s present limit is 53,400, a figure reached after work to add a third tier to the South Stand was completed in 2015. The latest proposals would mean the North Stand extendeds in an enterprise that includes the building of a new club shop and museum as well as the hotel. The City Square fan zone would be expanded and covered with new food and drink outlets. A consultation process will take place early next year.City have planning permission to extend the North Stand, having obtained it when they received the go-ahead for their South Stand scheme.The club said they were “undertaking feasibility studies to develop a best-in-class fan experience and a year-round entertainment and leisure destination at the Etihad Stadium.“Fans and the community are welcome to share any initial views, including what they would like to see at the Etihad Stadium in the future, or any matters they would like the club to address, in advance of formal consultations in early 2023.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballThe plans are part of a wider programme around the Etihad Campus with a 23,000-plus capacity indoor arena, Co-op Live, being built in the vicinity.","['undertaking feasibility studies to develop a best-in-class fan experience and a year-round entertainment and leisure destination at the Etihad Stadium', 'Fans and the community are welcome to share any initial views, including what they would like to see at the Etihad Stadium in the future, or any matters they would like the club to address, in advance of formal consultations in early 2023.']",
Lallana and March on target as Brighton ease to victory at Southampton,The Guardian,PA Media,2022-12-26,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/26/southampton-brighton-premier-league-match-report," Adam Lallana struck against his former club as Brighton inflicted more misery on struggling Southampton with a resounding 3-1 Premier League victory at St Mary’s.The Saints academy graduate Lallana benefited from a major blunder from the home goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu to put Albion ahead before Romain Perraud’s calamitous own goal doubled their half-time advantage. Brighton winger Solly March thumped home a third to cap a dismal first home game in top-flight management for the Southampton manager, Nathan Jones.James Ward-Prowse pulled a goal back by heading in on the rebound after his 73rd-minute penalty was saved by Robert Sánchez but a Southampton fightback never looked likely.Defeat for the error-strewn hosts means they remain languishing in the relegation zone and leaves Jones in no doubt about the magnitude of the job facing him.“We never really gave ourselves a chance of winning,” said Jones. “We didn’t do the basics well enough and didn’t deserve anything from the game. We gifted them two goals. We have to make sure we have a foothold in the game and at the minute we’re not giving ourselves a chance.”The former Luton manager Jones was forced to wait almost seven weeks for his first taste of top-flight action on home soil, having replaced the sacked Ralph Hasenhüttl just two days before a 3-1 defeat at Liverpool on 12 November. Things quickly turned sour for the Welshman on an afternoon when his listless team were jeered off at the end of each half. Brighton, still without the World Cup winner Alexis Mac Allister, began brighter and edged ahead in the 14th minute as Lallana’s glancing header embarrassed the Republic of Ireland international Bazunu. The Brighton midfielder turned neatly deep inside Saints’ territory and then played the ball wide to March before darting into the box to direct the subsequent inswinging cross through the arms of the blundering keeper.The former England international Lallana, who left Saints for Liverpool in 2014 having joined the club’s academy aged 12, was booed in the early stages but his celebration was subdued.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballSouthampton resumed action after the World Cup with the worst home record in the division and the avoidable opener swiftly prompted grumblings of discontent in the stands. The captain, Ward-Prowse, flashed a free-kick narrowly wide to offer some encouragement before the hosts fell further behind in catastrophic fashion, darkening the mood.Saints’ defence had struggled to contain Pervis Estupiñán and Kaoru Mitoma on Brighton’s left from the first whistle and 10 minutes before the break they combined for the former to deliver a tantalising low cross, which Perraud clumsily directed into his own goal under pressure from March.Southampton began the second period with greater purpose and Samuel Edozie twice threatened. But March soon halted any growing momentum by cutting in from the right to smash a stunning drive into the top left corner from around 25 yards.As Southampton supporters watched on with gloomy expressions, Brighton’s capacity following revelled in their side’s scintillating display, with chants of “the south coast is ours” followed by ones about the possibility of a European adventure next season.Saints finally gave themselves some hope when the lively Edozie was felled in the box by Pascal Gross. Sánchez, who was booked for the delaying of the spot-kick, saved Ward-Prowse’s initial kick after diving to his right but was powerless to repel the follow-up effort.The Spain international later risked a second yellow card after a clash with Che Adams before Brighton coasted to a third league win from four games to finish the day still in seventh, denied a rise of one place when Liverpool won the 5.30pm game at Aston Villa.“For the quality of play, the strategy of game, it was a fantastic day,” said the Brighton manager, Robert De Zerbi. “For me, the most important is not the result, it’s how much my players follow me. I’m very happy. We played probably the best game with me as a coach. We are improving.”","['We never really gave ourselves a chance of winning,', 'We didn’t do the basics well enough and didn’t deserve anything from the game. We gifted them two goals.

Guardiola ponders ‘ridiculous’ plans for Manchester City’s derby date at United,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson,2023-01-10,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/10/pep-guardiola-ridiculous-plans-manchester-city-manchester-united-derby-premier-league,"Pep Guardiola says he is considering “ridiculous” plans for Manchester City’s derby at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Saturday.City first play at Southampton in the Carabao Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, but the manager is already assessing strategies to try to defeat their crosstown rivals.“I have a few ideas, thoughts – ridiculous ones against United – but still I didn’t watch their last games,” Guardiola said. “I have to see the way they play at home and if they change something. I still have to review it; that is why I don’t have a clear lineup [yet] against United.”After City beat Chelsea in last Thursday’s league fixture at Stamford Bridge Guardiola rested key players for the FA Cup win against the same opposition at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, including Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. Freshness will be a factor in Guardiola’s selection for the derby.“The [Cup] game against Chelsea I made a lot of changes for one reason: how tired I saw some players after the game [in London], after the trip. We arrived too late back and in the training the day after I saw the players tired. It also depends on those who didn’t play against Chelsea. I would like to arrive against United with the average of minutes in the legs of the players quite similar.”Guardiola does not feel De Bruyne or Haaland necessarily need minutes against Southampton to be at their peak to face United. “You think about that but at the same time these players have played a lot of games in the last years. Kevin: if for four or five days he doesn’t play, will he lose something? I don’t think so. I don’t think it is an issue if they do not play for eight or nine days.”Kalvin Phillips is poised to make his first City start at Southampton and Guardiola urged the midfielder to ensure Rodri “cannot sleep” by competing with the Spaniard for a regular place in the team.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“He has to fight with Rodri for the benefit of all of us,” he said. “Rodri cannot sleep and [has to] have the feeling there is someone close to him to do it.”Guardiola was asked whether Phillips could win this battle. “Why not?” he said. “It depends on him how he is able to fight with Rodri.”","['ridiculous', 'I have a few ideas, thoughts – ridiculous ones against United – but still I didn’t watch their last games,', 'I have to see the way they play at home and if they change something.

Non-league Wrexham secure FA Cup upset at Coventry in seven-goal epic,The Guardian,John Brewin at the Coventry Building Society Arena,2023-01-07,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/07/coventry-wrexham-fa-cup-third-round-match-report,"It was only briefly sunny in Coventry. It was otherwise rain-lashed and windy. Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, Wrexham’s proprietors, had stayed away, presumably waiting for a Premier League club in the next round.In their absence, their team prevailed after a chaotic, dramatic FA Cup tie. It doubtless made for high-quality streaming content in showing off the old competitions’s finest win-or-bust essence, even if McElhenney complained on social media that his feed had crashed during the game. A National League club, even one with Disney financing, takes its place in this year’s fourth round draw. Now, does that actually count as a giantkilling?Coventry, a club in limbo with a takeover “imminent” since November, have no such access to funding. Their manager, Mark Robins, whose history-changing third-round Manchester United goal against Nottingham Forest was scored 33 years ago to the day, was this time on the wrong end of the Cup’s creation of unlikely heroes.The Coventry Building Society Arena, these days owned by Mike Ashley and Wasps’ home until the rugby club’s demise, was nowhere near full but the tie hugely exceeded Wrexham’s Ollie Palmer’s less-than-enthusiastic billing when he had shrugged that “Coventry isn’t overly appealing to the lads”.Not that Wrexham, the club of Mickey Thomas’s rocket, lack Cup magic. Their manager, Phil Parkinson, was the architect of Bradford City’s 4-2 win at José Mourinho’s Chelsea in 2015. Meanwhile, their fans, who travelled in droves from north Wales and made an absolute racket, treated it as a big occasion. “From the moment the coach turned up, the greeting from our fans waiting outside the ground, the lads felt 10 feet tall,” said Parkinson.“They’ve brought 4,000 fans with them and that’s the noisiest I’ve ever heard this stadium,” added Robins.The uninterested Palmer was benched until the 68th minute for Sam Dalby, who rewarded Parkinson with a fine header, pouncing between two defenders to meet Luke Young’s cross and score the opener. Coventry’s former Chelsea starlet Kasey Palmer soon rattled a free-kick off the post but then Elliott Lee drifted in a right-footed cross from the left, that beat everyone, including Coventry goalkeeper Simon Moore, caught on the wrong foot, for the second.“I didn’t want to come and soak up pressure,” said Parkinson. “I wanted to come and play.”Such an approach reaped huge rewards. Wrexham – and their owners – could start dreaming of glamour ties in the next round but then Robins was forced to bring on leading scorer Viktor Gyökeres in regrettable circumstance. Fábio Tavares had broken down with what his manager later confirmed was “a ruptured achilles”. Within seconds, Martyn Waghorn’s flick had set up Ben Sheaf to pull Coventry back into the tie.And yet Wrexham entered the break with their two-goal advantage restored, Tom O’Connor nodding past Simon Moore after Ben Tozer’s throw, a not-so secret weapon for Wrexham, was flicked back into the danger area by Jordan Tunnicliffe. Coventry’s defending was again statuesque.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballThat looked to set up the second half as a test of Wrexham’s defence but Coventry’s continuing defensive indiscipline delivered the crucial blow. Tozer launched another missile, the second ball bounced loose and Max Cleworth’s goalbound shot was handled by Jonathan Panzo. Tom Nield, the referee, saw Panzo’s offence as deliberate, awarding both penalty and red card. Paul Mullin gleefully scored from the spot.“That’s probably the most embarrassed I’ve felt in the first 60 minutes of a football match that I’ve managed,” said Robins.The drama was not finished. The threatening, intelligent Gyökeres scored to set Wrexham’s nerves jangling and when Palmer nailed a 77th-minute free-kick from the edge of the area there was still time for a comeback.Even with 10 men, Coventry’s superior fitness began to overwhelm Wrexham. Howard made a sprawling save from Gyökeres, then another from Todd Kane, as cramp began to wrack those in red. Palmer, sliding in and blazing over, missed the final chance and Wrexham’s party could begin in the away end – and in North America, too.“The way we played and the support we had tells you everything you need to know,” said Parkinson. “There’s a fantastic positive vibe in the town behind the club and the team. It’s my job as a manager to create some more memories.”","['imminent', 'Coventry isn’t overly appealing to the lads', 'From the moment the coach turned up, the greeting from our fans waiting outside the ground, the lads felt 10 feet tall,', 'They’ve brought 4,000 fans with them and that’s the noisiest I’ve ever heard this stadium,', 'I didn’t want to come and soak up pressure,', 'I wanted to come and play.', 'a ruptured achilles', 'That’s probably the most embarrassed I’ve felt in the first 60 minutes of a football match that I’ve managed,', 'The way we played and the support we had tells you everything you need to know,', 'There’s a fantastic positive vibe in the town behind the club and the team.

Football transfer rumours: Manchester United in for Kolo Muani?,The Guardian,Will Magee,2023-01-06,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/06/football-transfer-rumours-manchester-united-in-for-kolo-muani,"Today’s tittle-tattle is unseasonably warmIt’s bad news for Manchester United fans who enjoy interminable transfer sagas. According to Joan Laporta, the Barcelona president, Frenkie de Jong is “not for sale”. Thankfully, United are linked with countless other players so, for the moment at least, the Barça midfielder can take a back seat. Taking his place riding up front in United’s careening transfer go-kart: Randal Kolo Muani, with Mohammed Kudus perched precariously above the cup holders and Axel Disasi clinging on to the headrest.Having impressed at Eintracht Frankfurt so far this season, Kolo Muani could be an interesting solution to United’s striker problem. That said, Frankfurt apparently value him at anything up to €100m (£88.5m) and wouldn’t want to let him go in January which, given United’s pressing need for a forward, could be a stumbling block. As long as Frankfurt qualify for Europe, the France international could even stay beyond the summer. Oh, and he’s also a target for Bayern Munich.As for Kudus, the Ghana international knows Erik ten Hag well from their time at Ajax together. He could cost over £35m, however, which his former manager thinks is a bit steep. While he has played up front for Ajax recently, he has previously said that he’s at his best as a No 10. So, again, it might not be the best fit.What about Disasi, then? The Monaco defender forced his way into France’s World Cup squad and ended up making three appearances in Qatar, earning some new admirers along the way. West Ham and Tottenham are among them, so United better move fast. While Harry Maguire is being kept on as cover, Disasi’s arrival could nudge him closer to the exit door.Elsewhere, Southampton are mulling over a move for Michael Keane. Having made it four defeats from four in the Premier League against Nottingham Forest on Wednesday, Nathan Jones is in dire need of something, anything, to lift his squad. Keane has only made three appearances for Everton this season so he may not be at his sharpest, but he does at least have plenty of experience. Southampton are also close to signing Mislav Orsic from Dinamo Zagreb for £6m.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballLikewise, after restarting the season with three league defeats on the bounce, Leicester are looking to drum up reinforcements. Brendan Rodgers has his eye on Dango Ouattara, the young winger spearheading Lorient’s impressive Ligue 1 campaign. It’s yet to be seen whether he can be convinced to swap a European push for a survival battle. If anyone can win him round it’s Rodgers, surely.",['not for sale'],
Chelsea poised to sign João Félix on loan from Atlético Madrid for rest of season,The Guardian,Jacob Steinberg,2023-01-09,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/09/chelsea-joao-felix-on-loan-atletico-madrid-sign,"Chelsea are poised to sign João Félix on loan from Atlético Madrid for the rest of the season as they try to find a way out of the slump that left them off the pace in the Premier League and out of the FA Cup.Chelsea will pay about €10m (£8.8m) to borrow the Portugal forward and no buy option is expected to be included. Félix, who joined Atlético for €126m from Benfica in July 2019, has started seven of his club’s 16 league matches this season.The urgency with which Chelsea have pushed for the 23-year-old accelerated after injuries to Raheem Sterling, Christian Pulisic, Armando Broja and most recently Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who missed the 4-0 FA Cup defeat at Manchester City on Sunday with a back complaint.Félix, who can play as a second striker, winger or centre-forward, is not the only player wanted by Chelsea, who have this month brought in David Datro Fofana and Benoît Badiashile and reached an agreement for the young Vasco da Gama midfielder Andrey Santos.The Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernández is a key target, although the Portuguese club have accused Chelsea of acting disrespectfully in their pursuit of the Argentinian and said he will not leave unless the buyout clause – understood to be €120m – is met. Positive talks have been held over a deal for the Shakhtar Donetsk winger Mykhailo Mudryk but his preference is to join Arsenal.Chelsea’s co-owners, Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, are determined to back Graham Potter, whose suitability as head coach has been questioned by some fans. The team have lost five, drawn one and won one of their past seven matches and next face a Premier League derby at Fulham on Thursday, sitting 10 points off fourth place.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballSouthampton have agreed a €14m fee with Racing Club to sign Carlos Alcaraz, with the 20-year-old Argentina youth international poised to sign a deal until 2027.

One more Amazon product I can ignore.

You enjoy a sport? Go play it.

You got kids or relatives playing sports? Go cheer them on.
Agreed. Fuck the disabled and childless!Disabled and childless can play sports. Did you take one too many hockey pucks to the head?Why do you feel that your opinion rates higher than literally tens of millions of other people who enjoy watching sports?If you don't, then don't.  But just because you don't, it doesn't make you superior to them in some way.  There's probably some other smug asshole out there that feels the same way about shit you enjoy doing too.Try this: do what you enjoy, and leave other people to do what they enjoy.  And leave the judgement securely in the cesspool you call ""thought"".
Ask yourself ""who benefits?"" Pro sports is about making you the product. And about distracting from real problems - been true since the ""bread and circuses"" of ancient Rome.

I'm not against sports - which is why I wrote that if people are into them, they should get away from the screen and actually participate at the local level. If you have something against that, it says more about you than me.You didn't answer my question.Why do you think that your method of spending free time in the pursuit of enjoyment is superior to others?  And why do you feel the need to be smug about it on the Internet?The introspection required to answer those two questions may even promote personal growth.You didn't answer my question.Why do you think that your method of spending free time in the pursuit of enjoyment is superior to others?  And why do you feel the need to be smug about it on the Internet?The introspection required to answer those two questions may even promote personal growth.That's your question, not mine.  So, not my problem.

But since you're too stupid/trolish to figure it out:
None of that answers the two simple questions I asked.  Instead, you're sticking your fingers in your ears and yelling LA LA LA while continuing to answer questions nobody asked.Conclusion: you're just being smug, because you seem to think you're better than other people for reasons that are completely baseless and only exist in your own addled mind.  Your chosen form of entertainment is not better, or worse, than anyone else's.  Neither is mine.  But acting like it is confirms you are a smug douchebag withou
Your questions are YOUR problem. Not mine.

I pointed out the physical, mental, and community benefits for my way.

You can't show the same benefits for sitting around watching pro sports. So who's sticking their fingers in their ears and going ""la-la-la?"" You.

The economic harm of pro sports to host cities is well documented. The same can be said for health problems from lack of exercise.

So just how is your statement:Your chosen form of entertainment is not better, or worse, than anyone else's. Neither is mine.- true in any shape, manner, or form? Seems yours is worse, and you haven't even tried 
Oh boy, got me some real live ones here ...

I listed 4 benefits of getting off your ass and actually participating in sports at the local level.

So what do you bring up - people in gyms watching sports on TV. WTF? Seriously - ""because they want to watch other athletes."" Like they can't do that while participating with other people at the local level?

And if they're watching TV, they're not getting any of the mental benefits of socializing by participating in group sports. So I'd call that a minus, not a The amount of unwanted sports contents promoted on the main Amazon Prime Video app is unbearable. I was praying for this day for a long, long time.Nah. I'm a pragmatic person. I printed out Jeff's portrait and hung it above my bed.Too bad nothing will change to improve that. They'll just be advertising that you can get that content through their new app, as if anybody wanted yet another streaming app to deal with.Hear, Hear!I ""cut my cable"" a long time ago, partly because of how much it cost per month for loads of channels I never watched (sports anything being a huge contributor to increased pricing for stuff I completely had no interest in)I think separating it out so that sports folks can pay the full cost of their sportsing and stop letting us non-sports folks vote with our dollars is a good thing.
My smart TVs come with Samsung TV Plus - about 70-some-odd channels of old content. Right now I've got the Beverly Hillbillies running on one of them.

There's also Tubi as a Smart TV app. And on the computer.

And Pluto TV.

And over-the-air TV with external cheapie antennas.

And then there's video games.

And of course various web sites.

And email, text, voice, and video calls.

And then there's walking the dog and other real-world stuff.
There's media anti-siphoning laws where I live, so the top tier of most events are guaranteed to be available to FTA networks to bid on and host. You should get your politicians to look into something similar.
Ditto for local content requirements.In school, it just wastes time and resources...while creating division amongst students.We're one of the fattest fucking countries in the world. I could give a toss about pro sports-ball but we should absolutely be doing more to promote sports in schools.Fuck off...we've had P.E. for years and it's done nothing. Only a small percentage of students actually play sports...meanwhile the majority of students are (or should be) trying to learn real life skills.Learning how to live a healthy life is a life skill genius. It's probably a more important life skill than at least half of what kids are taught in schools in fact.What the hell is ""promoting"" going to do? It's not as if anyone is unaware of the fact that they can go run around and play a game.Developing healthy lifestyle habits in kids is well known to effect their health later in life. I was raised eating healthy and grew up with an emphasis on sports and playing outside and here I am today in my 40s with a waist size one inch larger than when I was in high school. Meanwhile I am absolutely not one of those lucky ones who can sit on More than that, I think next year we're going to hear about Amazon making a very big 7-digit-per year bid on media rights to college sports from one of the ""Power 5"" conferences - the Pac-12.  It would be a shot across the bow for the traditional media networks that make actually enjoying the games almost impossible by dictating start times that have the game ending past 1:00a in eastern time, or cable carriers that just flat refuse to carry the ""Pac-12 Network"" leaving fans with no possibility to see the g Actually, Karl, it's sports. Let that stuff die and people might find more wholesome and interesting ways to spend their time.Actually, Karl, it's sports. Let that stuff die and people might find more wholesome and interesting ways to spend their time.Turns out the masses can do multiple drugs at the same time - sports, religion, real drugs, social media ... they think they're ""multi-tasking"", but they're not very good at it.How does this not describe almost everything that exists on every streaming platform described as ""entertainment""?  That's the whole point of the entertainment to sap up resources for no other purpose than to pass time without feeling the misery of our outside existence.
Well, look at the games that deal with everything from off-season trades and roster management to coaching. There's lots of nerds playing them.

As for actually playing a sport being an ""escapist activity that saps up resources"", isn't all entertainment an ""escapist activity?"" And isn't physical exercise playing with others something our parents encouraged - ""go outside and play"" because it has physical, mental, and social benefits?

Howard Webb returns to England on mission to boost referees’ confidence,The Guardian,Paul MacInnes,2022-12-29,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/29/howard-webb-returns-to-england-on-mission-to-boost-referees-confidence,"Premier League’s first chief refereeing officer feels standards have improved but admits more transparency is needed“When you think about refereeing it’s very much about confidence,” says Howard Webb. “It’s a mental discipline, you need resilience to be successful at it. My job is to make sure that referees are going into their job feeling confident and supported.”After eight years away, the most successful referee of the Premier League era has come back to the English game. His contract overseeing officials in the US had come to an end and he had been in discussions about coming home in some form for a while, but Webb’s appointment as the first chief refereeing officer in the elite game has the feel of a necessity, as – by common consent – the men in black need all the help they can get.At the peak of his refereeing career, in 2010, Webb took charge of a Champions League final and a World Cup final within a month of each other. He was also labelled a secret Manchester United fan before social media made accusations of bias fashionable. So, on and off the pitch, he has some sense of how refereeing works. Now he will be expected to spend the money assigned by the Premier League as part of its Elite Referee Development Plan and deliver on its expected returns.Webb’s experience working in the States has obviously given him some ideas, but there remain some real challenges that won’t be easily unpicked, most obviously in the form of VAR. Webb calls himself a “big exponent” of video refereeing, an attitude he dates back to seeing Thierry Henry handle the ball against the Republic of Ireland on the way to the 2010 World Cup, and his own experience of missing Nigel de Jong’s kung fu kick on Xabi Alonso in the final. “That decision lives with me,” he says. “I wanted to get it right, but I clearly didn’t see it right. So why not have the opportunity to go and rectify the error in real time there and then?”The role of VAR is clear to Webb: it should be there to provide peace of mind to officials, not re-referee the game. “My job is to make sure we get the consistency around the question VARs have been told to ask themselves: was [the referee’s decision] clearly wrong?” he says. But he also acknowledges that the simple existence of the technology can create unintentional consequences.He describes VAR as a safety net, and referees as tightrope walkers. The safety net can change the referee’s approach to a task and make them less concerned about making a mistake. “A lot of our work has to be around making sure they walk on that tightrope as if the safety net wasn’t there,” he says. He also wants referees to be more willing to reject the advice of a VAR, especially when they are called to the pitchside monitor, but knows too that referees are listening to peers who might be conveying their advice forcefully. “I’ve never refereed with [VAR] so how it affects your psyche as a ref I don’t really know personally,” he admits.A second great challenge is to improve referees’ decision-making in the first place. Webb insists that standards have improved since he put down his whistle in 2014, but says that the speed and complexity of elite football has risen even faster. He also accepts that, whatever the statistics say, any improvement is not regularly perceived by fans. “Clearly the fact that there’s been a change, that I’ve been brought in, suggests there’s a feeling that we need to raise standards even further,” he says. “There’s an expectation they will get better.”Alongside an expanded recruitment programme and more coaching for referees (with former Premier League officials Jon Moss and Martin Atkinson already recruited in such roles) Webb believes that consistent communication will be key to improving things. In the US he got into the habit of setting up referees and officials with broadcasters after each round of fixtures to discuss contentious decisions and believes this both informed media coverage and broke down mystique. He is hopeful of doing something similar in England but accepts even this comes with risks. “You don’t want to turn referees into celebrities,” he says. “But as it stands there’s clearly a feeling that perception [of refereeing] could be better and the level of transparency could be better. And I think that’s right.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballWebb says that in the US, where football is an insurgent sport looking to challenge established favourites, the message when talking about refereeing and VAR was “don’t kill the project”. Allow for criticism, yes, but get behind what the game was trying to achieve. A different kind of attitude will be necessary in England if the rehabilitation of refereeing is to be achieved.“I think there’s probably less forgiveness here, generally speaking,” Webb says. “The relationship with football here is engrained, that leads to some resistance to change. The scrutiny any information comes under over here is different to anything you get over there.”Aspirations of transparency and openness can often get waylaid when a desire for change meets the reality of English football. But Webb has succeeded before and done the hard yards of learning before taking on the impossible job, refereeing edition.

Virgil van Dijk says anything is possible for Liverpool in ‘crazy’ season,The Guardian,Andy Hunter,2023-01-01,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/01/virgil-van-dijk-says-anything-is-possible-for-liverpool-in-crazy-season,"Virgil van Dijk has said World Cup disappointment will fuel his desire for success with Liverpool and the Netherlands in 2023, claiming anything is possible in what could prove “a very crazy” Premier League season.An encouraging World Cup ended sourly for the Netherlands and their captain when they were beaten on penalties in a fractious quarter-final by Argentina. Van Dijk’s penalty was saved by Emiliano Martínez in the shootout, which the eventual champions won 4-3, causing the Liverpool defender several sleepless nights in the aftermath.Van Dijk, however, believes he can channel the setback into a fruitful year for club and country, and suggested Liverpool’s sights are set higher than finishing in the top four after an inconsistent first part of the season. Jürgen Klopp’s team have won four successive Premier League games to close the gap on the Champions League contenders going into Monday’s trip to Brentford.The Netherlands captain said: “I had time to reflect. It was a great experience to lead the boys out there and it comes with a lot of responsibility. The whole world is watching, which is something that I really enjoyed.“Things were disappointing in the end for us, that is also part of football. It was a tough couple of days but then it was about switching back towards the most important things in life; my wife and kids.“It fuels me because I want to be successful with the Netherlands. I feel like we have a fantastic squad and new era with Ronald Koeman coming back and young players coming through, like Cody [Gakpo] for example. He can make big steps with his transfer and then become more important for us.“Hopefully we can do something nice in the summer with the Nations League finals, that is something I really want to win, even though it is the end of the season when you are absolutely shattered.“It has also motivated me here. We are quite some points behind Arsenal but the season could be a very crazy one, a very strange one. But we have to be realistic and we’re not thinking about the title at the moment. We have to focus on the game ahead of us, win games and then we’ll see.”The World Cup quarter-final was acrimonious throughout and ended with Argentina players taunting the Netherlands’ after the penalty shootout. Van Dijk said: “It was a very intense game from start to finish for both sides. You saw me doing things that I normally don’t do. [The shove on Leandro Paredes] was something I don’t normally do but it was the heat of the moment and we are all human beings. They won, we lost through penalties, and that is the hard reality.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballFrance’s Ibrahima Konaté should be available for the Brentford game after a post-World Cup final break while Roberto Firmino, James Milner and Curtis Jones could return from injury. The new signing Gakpo could feature if registered in time but is more likely to make his debut against Wolves in the FA Cup on Saturday.Klopp reiterated that there was not an endless supply of money for transfers. “I am now here seven years and it is every window is pretty much the same; we talk about these things as though money didn’t play a role,” he said. “It is never like this. We sign an outstanding player like Cody Gakpo and then you read about the next player. We cannot play like Monopoly.

Gianni Infantino announces 32-team men’s Club World Cup in 2025,The Guardian,Nick Ames in Doha,2022-12-16,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/16/gianni-infantino-announces-32-team-mens-club-world-cup-in-2025,"Gianni Infantino has risked a major row with Europe’s leading federations by announcing that Fifa will launch a 32-team men’s Club World Cup in 2025.In what amounts to an ambush to the Premier League and its counterparts, the Fifa president confirmed the drastic expansion of a tournament whose current annual iteration sees seven teams compete. His revelation was made even though no agreements have been made with the relevant domestic leagues.The revamped event will, as trailed by Infantino, take place every four years. It is understood that no formal proposals have been shown to the Premier League, whose stance was set in November 2021 and remains unchanged. Back then the league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, said it was “committed to preventing any radical changes to the post-2024 Fifa international match calendar that would adversely affect player welfare and threaten the competitiveness, calendar, structures and traditions of domestic football.”It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.There is no indication at this stage about the likely venue for a tournament that will require significant financial backing. An expanded Club World Cup has long been a hobby horse of Infantino’s. In 2018 he proposed a new 24-team event that was looked on dimly by Uefa; it was slated to take place in China last year but was put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Barrelling on with a plan for an even bigger event will raise eyebrows across Europe and sets some of the sport’s key stakeholders on a collision course. It is inconceivable Infantino’s plan would not involve a bulk of European teams. He also confirmed a new women’s Club World Cup is being planned.Infantino’s announcement was his most eyecatching statement in a press conference, staged in the runup to Sunday’s World Cup final in Doha, which revealed that this winter’s tournament had brought in $7.5bn in revenues, $1bn more than budgeted, and boasted of its “unique cohesive power”. The president offered little in the way of answers to questions about off-pitch issues that have clouded Qatar 2022, saying Fifa is “defending human rights” and suggesting that figures around the deaths of migrant workers connected with the tournament have not been used accurately.He also announced that a new “Fifa World Series” of friendly tournaments, designed to pit teams from different continents against each other more frequently, will take place in even years across the March international break.The proposal was light on detail but is likely to generate further concerns about its added impact on existing scheduling and players’ travel time.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballThere were outbreaks of common sense in a speech that otherwise posed many more questions than solutions. Infantino said Fifa will reconsider the format of the group stage at the expanded 2026 World Cup, the drama of this year’s quarters reducing the likelihood that the next edition will comprise 16 groups of three. He also said that from 2025 the September and October international windows will be merged to create one extended break with four matchdays. A new women’s futsal World Cup was also among the raft of new events Infantino introduced.","['committed to preventing any radical changes to the post-2024 Fifa international match calendar that would adversely affect player welfare and threaten the competitiveness, calendar, structures and traditions of domestic football.', 'unique cohesive power', 'defending human rights', 'Fifa World Series']",
Antonio Conte mourns another friend with the death of Gianluca Vialli,The Guardian,David Hytner,2023-01-06,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/06/antonio-conte-mourns-another-friend-with-death-of-gianluca-vialli,"Terrible three months for Spurs manager after losing Ventrone and Mihajlovic – and now his former Juventus teammateFor the third time in three months, Antonio Conte felt a numbness, an emptiness and there were plenty of other emotions swirling, too. First Gian Piero Ventrone in early October, then Sinisa Mihajlovic in the middle of December, now Gianluca Vialli – three men that Conte has called colleagues but moreover holds dear as friends; each one taken far too soon.The Tottenham manager heard the news about Vialli as he travelled into work on Friday morning, how his former Juventus teammate had died at 58 after living with pancreatic cancer. Conte’s thoughts about the FA Cup tie at home to Portsmouth on Saturday and the club’s broader situation were suddenly overtaken and he knew one thing.As he had done after the death of Ventrone, Spurs’s greatly respected fitness coach whom he had known for years, Conte would stand down from his usual pre-match media conference. On this occasion, he delegated the duty to his longstanding assistant Cristian Stellini, who previously worked with him at Sienna, Juventus and Internazionale. Before that, Conte had coached him as a player at Bari.“Antonio is upset and sad,” Stellini said. “Every one of us is. We are close to Vialli’s family and all the people that loved Vialli. He is an important person in Italy and also in England. For us he was a great player but first of all he was a great man. He taught us a lot of things.”For Conte, it has been a terrible few months, the feelings intensified, perhaps, by his being a long way from his wife and daughter, who have continued to live in Italy. Ventrone, 61, and Mihajlovic, 53 – the Yugoslavia and Lazio legend – had leukaemia. Conte is also 53.“It’s hard to talk about this,” Stellini said. “Gian Piero was a really tough moment and then came the moment of Mihajlovic. Antonio and Mihajlovic were friends. Now is the moment of Vialli. It’s difficult. Antonio is a tough man. Maybe in this moment he is more closed to show his feelings. We have to stay close to him. This is family behaviour. We are, we feel, like a family. After this type of loss, you have to stay so close, to show love.”Conte’s old-school image is not only for public consumption. He will talk all day with Stellini and the rest of his staff about football but he closes the door when it comes to his personal feelings. He is not the kind of guy who likes to show weakness.“About football and work? Absolutely, we speak a lot,” Stellini said. “To speak about other things is more difficult. In the tough moments, maybe you don’t show … or the silence is more than words. We are in that moment.”Vialli was a trailblazer in so many ways, the first Italian manager, for example, to work in the Premier League, showing the way for Conte and others. Vialli was appointed as the Chelsea player-manager in February 1998, immediately leading the club to a League Cup and Cup Winners’ Cup double. In 1999-2000, having hung up his boots, he would win the FA Cup.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“Vialli opened the door for Italian managers,” Stellini said. “In that moment, maybe the Premier League was far away for Italian managers but now we have to say thanks to Vialli because he let us understand. Also, because an Italian manager came to the Premier League and improved the league, it was a great thing.”Vialli’s death has surely encouraged Conte to reflect, offering a measure of perspective on Spurs’s position. So much appears to be on edge – from Conte’s future to the feelings of the fans, who are never too far from calling for the head of the chairman, Daniel Levy, which they did during last Sunday’s 2-0 home loss to Aston Villa. Things picked up with Wednesday’s 4-0 win at Crystal Palace.The next two Premier League games are huge – Arsenal home, Manchester City away – but first for Portsmouth against whom Conte intends to start Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.Vialli loved the FA Cup, having first won it as a Chelsea player in 1997 and Conte, too, is a previous winner, having managed Chelsea to victory in 2018. Vialli will be uppermost in his thoughts. “Antonio doesn’t drop the intensity and he can find new energy [from this situation],” Stellini said. “This is the type of man he is. This is Antonio.”","['Antonio is upset and sad,', 'Every one of us is. We are close to Vialli’s family and all the people that loved Vialli. He is an important person in Italy and also in England.

Erik ten Hag believes Manchester United sale by Glazers would be good,The Guardian,Reuters,2022-12-15,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/15/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-sale-by-glazers-good,"Erik ten Hag has said the Glazer family’s decision to explore a sale of Manchester United could be a good thing and that he has been reassured any change in ownership would not affect the “objectives, goals and culture” of the club.United’s US owners began looking at options last month, including new investment or a potential sale, 17 years after buying the club.The fans have been clamouring for a change of ownership and the Glazers have been the target of intense criticism as the team, who have a record 13 Premier League titles, have gone five years without winning a trophy. Ten Hag said he had not spoken with the owners but had discussed the plans with the United CEO, Richard Arnold. “My information is that it will only be good things because there will be more investment possible,” he said. “We spoke about the culture we want, we spoke about objectives, goals and the culture and he [Arnold] confirmed it won’t change, it will be even better because more money will become available for this project.”Ten Hag said United needed investment just to keep up in the Premier League and that it was important the funds were spent wisely. “Newcastle are coming, even West Ham, maybe not now in the table but they have huge investment … You can quickly count seven or eight clubs that can compete in this league.“It’s also about strategy not just money. But it’s clear that when you don’t have the right players and quality players you will not be successful and achieve the targets you set.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballOn Wednesday, the co-owner Avram Glazer was asked by the Athletic for an update on the sale of United and said: “It’s not necessarily a sale, it’s a process and we’re going forward with the process, so we’ll see what happens.”","['objectives, goals and culture', 'My information is that it will only be good things because there will be more investment possible,', 'We spoke about the culture we want, we spoke about objectives, goals and the culture and he [Arnold] confirmed it won’t change, it will be even better because more money will become available for this project.', 'Newcastle are coming, even West Ham, maybe not now in the table but they have huge investment … You can quickly count seven or eight clubs that can compete in this league', 'It’s also about strategy not just money.

Pep Guardiola ‘would have preferred another opponent than Leeds’ this week,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson,2022-12-27,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/27/pep-guardiola-leeds-manchester-city-premier-league,"Pep Guardiola has admitted concern about Manchester City’s defending before the World Cup break with the manager warning they cannot lose any more ground on Arsenal ahead of their “terrible” January schedule.City lost 2-1 against Brentford at the Etihad Stadium on 12 November in their final Premier League match before the World Cup and, before Wednesday’s game at Leeds, Guardiola admitted that his team could “not control” Ivan Toney, who scored both the visitors’ goals last month. Following Arsenal’s win against West Ham on Boxing Day, Mikel Arteta’s side have a seven-point lead at the top of the table over second-placed Newcastle, but City can retake that place and reduce the lead to five points if they beat Leeds.Guardiola said: “Against Brentford – when you [have to] play 10 balls against Toney – it is difficult to win the game – we cannot control the long balls, we cannot control the transitions and we were completely [in trouble].“I would have preferred another opponent than Leeds at this moment after the World Cup. They are the most aggressive team in the Premier League, statistically. They don’t give you time to think and you have to be precise. After our defeat against Brentford, and with how strong Arsenal are, as well as the opponents who [can] come from behind, we have to be alert and careful, because if the distance is bigger, it will be so difficult to catch them.”Guardiola was happier with City’s defending in the 3-2 victory against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup last Thursday. “You cannot think against Liverpool you are not going to concede chances – in the transitions they are a fantastic team,” he said. “I don’t think there is a team in the world that I am [more impressed with] – every game is completely different and against them we defend really, really well.”After Leeds, City host Everton on New Year’s Eve, before playing six games next month, including three against direct rivals in the Premier League. Next Thursday (5 January) they visit Chelsea before hosting the same opposition in the FA Cup third round three days later (8 January). Then there are just two days before a visit to Southampton in the Carabao Cup (10 January), followed by three league games in nine days – the Manchester derby at Old Trafford (14 January) and two home games to round off the month: against Tottenham (19 January) and Wolves (22 January).Guardiola said: “Our schedule in January is terrible in terms of the amount of games and the quality of the opponents. We have to restart. This is what we have done against Liverpool and hopefully we can continue.”Erling Haaland scored his 24th goal of the season against Liverpool. Guardiola was asked if the striker’s foot injury that has previously troubled him requires management in light of the host of issues that caused the Norwegian to miss 16 games at his former club Borussia Dortmund in the 2021-22 campaign.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“The injury is completely different to last season,” the manager said. “It was a knock on his foot in Dortmund, when we played them in the Champions League [in October].

Ronaldo embracing new challenge at Al Nassr after winning ... - Reuters.com,Reuters,,2023-01-03,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/ronaldo-embracing-new-challenge-al-nassr-after-winning-everything-europe-2023-01-03/,"RIYADH, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo said his ""work is done"" in Europe, adding that he is relishing new challenges both on and off the pitch after being unveiled as a player of Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr on Tuesday.Ronaldo, who was a free agent following his acrimonious split with Manchester United in November, joined Al Nassr last week on a 2-1/2 year deal estimated by media to be worth more than 200 million euros ($210.94 million).He was greeted by a sea of yellow and blue at Al Nassr's home ground Mrsool Park, where thousands of fans turned up to witness his unveiling.After addressing a news conference, Ronaldo was seen meeting with his new team mates in the dressing room. He then made his way onto the pitch, fully kitted out in the club's colours.The gathered fans loudly chanted his name as he walked around the 25,000-seater stadium signing footballs and firing them into the stands, before he was joined by his family.""Me and my family, we want to say thank you to all of you for this support and your welcome,"" an emotional Ronaldo said after being handed a microphone. ""We're going to give our best. Thank you everybody.""Ronaldo arrives in Saudi Arabia with a vast collection of club honours after a glittering spell at Spanish giants Real Madrid from 2009-18 where he won two LaLiga titles, two Spanish Cups, four Champions League titles and three Club World Cups.He also claimed two Serie A titles and a Copa Italia trophy in three years at Juventus before rejoining United with whom he had bagged three Premier League crowns, the FA Cup, two League Cups, the Champions League and Club World Cup.""I'm so proud to make this big decision in my life. In Europe, my work is done,"" Ronaldo told a news conference.""I won everything, I played in the most important clubs in Europe and now it's a new challenge in Asia.""Ronaldo added that he had several potential suitors from all around the world following his exit from United, but chose to sign with Al Nassr because the move provided him a chance to make an impact off the pitch.""I'm grateful to Al Nassr, for giving me this opportunity to develop football for the younger generation, for the women as well. For me, it's a challenge, but I also feel very happy and proud,"" Ronaldo said.""I can say now, I had many opportunities in Europe, Brazil, Australia and the United States. Even in Portugal, many clubs tried to sign me, but I gave my word to this club, to develop not only football but also the other parts of this country.""The 37-year-old batted away questions about criticism of his move to Saudi Arabia, saying, ""I'm a unique player, for me it's normal.""Al Nassr coach Rudi Garcia said the signing of Ronaldo was a huge step for the Saudi Arabian league.""In my life, I've seen that great players like Cristiano are the simplest to manage, because there's nothing I can teach him,"" Garcia told reporters.""Like he said, we are here to win, nothing else. I want him to enjoy playing with Al Nassr and winning with Al Nassr, just that.""Ronaldo's move has been the subject of countless rumours, with some reports saying his contract includes a clause which will allow him to join Newcastle United on loan, while others have alleged that the previous holder of the 'Number 7' shirt was cut loose from the squad for refusing to swap shirt numbers.($1 = 0.9481 euros)Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Belinda Bencic came through a second-set wobble to ease into the quarter-finals of the Adelaide International 2 with a 6-3 6-3 victory over Anna Kalinskaya on Wednesday.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

Sport’s most memorable moments of 2022 – No 2: Football,The Guardian,John Brewin,2022-12-27,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/27/sports-most-memorable-moments-of-2022-no-2-football,"From the Lionesses roaring to a controversial men’s World Cup via the big Chelsea sale and records tumbling in BarcelonaThe greatest? Qatar 2022 served up the best World Cup final for decades and Lionel Messi, in finally lifting the World Cup, confirmed himself as the finest player of the 21st century, should that have been in doubt. Amid the celebrations, Messi kept the coolest head, even making sure to sidestep the pestering of gold-steak seasoner and Gianni Infantino acolyte Salt Bae.Infantino and the host nation had the showpiece they wanted, Messi and Kylian Mbappé coming to the party to echo the game’s greats. Mbappé’s hat-trick saw him overtake Pelé, Vavá and Geoff Hurst as the highest scorer in World Cup final ties, while Messi lived up to the ghost of Diego Maradona.It followed a tournament that fully entertained and in Morocco delivered a first African and Arab team to the semis. That still wasn’t enough to change anyone’s opinion of Qatar hosting a World Cup. The organisers remained defensive to the last, discussions of migrant labour and human rights deflected by hails of whataboutery. Beyond the feats of Messi and Mbappé, empty stadiums in the desert are now monuments to the lives lost in constructing a show of opulence.It came home. Chloe Kelly’s winning goal in extra time against Germany at Wembley crowned a first senior title for an England national team since 1966. Sarina Wiegman was the calming mastermind behind it, the Dutch coach winning a second successive Euros, harnessing the wealth of English talent developed in the Women’s Super League.The goals were scored by Kelly and Ella Toone, each introduced from the bench, Wiegman’s game management taking the match away from an experienced Germany team overwhelmed by the Lionesses’ depth of talent. Beth Mead, with six goals, had inspired England to the final, but an injury saw her give way to Kelly in the final.The road to Wembley had not been totally serene, it requiring a poacher’s finish from Toone to take Spain to extra time in a quarter-final at Brighton. And the final itself, in front of a record attendance, supplied high drama before scenes of post-match celebration as a new audience for the women’s game was welcomed to the fold.Kelly’s goal, scrambled in after a corner, was the achievement of a dream and will have inspired many others.When Russian forces moved into Ukraine on 24 February Roman Abramovich’s ownership of Chelsea entered its endgame. The UK government imposing sanctions on Russian oligarchs soon made that a fait accompli. Abramovich first sought to hand the stewardship to the club’s charitable foundation before, once it became clear his UK assets were to be frozen, confirming the club was for sale.“It pains me to part with the club in this manner,” read a statement that ended 19 years of a regime that changed the face of English football, accelerating transfer spending and introducing the concept of Premier League clubs as status symbols for the planet’s super-rich.Thus began a lengthy beauty contest of potential owners, a bidding process eventually won in May by a consortium led by Connecticut’s Todd Boehly partnered with the investment firm Clearlake Capital, for a price of £4.25bn. Boehy spending more than £250m on players and sacking Thomas Tuchel seven matches into the new season were decision-making very much in the style of Abramovich, though the new owners proved themselves disruptors, too. That hefty purchase price surely played a part in the American-owned Liverpool and Manchester United soon enough being prospected for potential sales or investment.The Champions League final on 28 May, between the 13-time winners Real Madrid and the six-time winners Liverpool had the makings of a classic. The bare facts of the game are a tight, tense game won by the better team in the Spanish side, the goal scored by Vinícius Júnior, though with Madrid’s goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois outstanding.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballPerhaps those facts are better remembered in Spain than on Merseyside, though fans from Madrid were also caught up in chaos caused by the gross mismanagement of the policing and stewarding of the occasion.Nobody died, probably by fortune alone, but Liverpool fans crushed against each other outside the stadium gates brought back bitter, painful memories of Hillsborough in 1989. Distressed, corralled down narrow passages by heavy-handed police and kept waiting as technology failed at the turnstiles, fans were then sprayed with teargas to make the situation even more panicked and uncomfortable.The French government, the police and Uefa’s immediate response of putting blame on fake tickets and fan behaviour brought back further echoes of Hillsborough. This time, the cover-up lasted hours rather than decades and a Uefa inquiry is in train, though questions remain over its independence.The growth of the women’s game continued in club football and when Barcelona hosted Real Madrid on 30 March a record crowd saw a clásico in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. The attendance reached 91,553 and the home team turned on the style, winning 5-2, 8-3 on aggregate.Barcelona looked unstoppable that night, Alexia Putellas, 2022’s eventual Ballon d’Or winner, resplendent, and yet in the final the defending champions, who had won every game in La Liga, lost to Lyon, inspired by the brilliant Ada Hegerberg.The Azteca Stadium crowd for the 1971 Women’s World Cup final between Denmark and Mexico in Mexico City, estimated at more than 100,000, presents another barrier to break but the sight of women’s football in venues such as the Camp Nou is becoming commonplace. Small stadiums such as Chelsea’s Kingsmeadow ripple with atmosphere but are not sizeable enough to meet growing demand.The death of Queen Elizabeth II meant the Women’s Super League’s opening weekend was postponed in early September, denying fans their post-Euros chance to see Tottenham play at White Hart Lane, Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and Brighton at the Amex.","['It pains me to part with the club in this manner,']",
Graham Potter must be given time at Chelsea or aspiring coaches are doomed | Jonathan Wilson,The Guardian,Jonathan Wilson,2023-01-06,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/06/graham-potter-chelsea-aspiring-coaches,"Perhaps Potter can hack it with a superclub, perhaps he can’t, but these would be difficult times at Stamford Bridge for any managerThe problem for any coach when they step up to a big club is that, until they have been successful at that level, the suspicion will always linger that they cannot be successful at that level. It’s one of the difficulties of the modern game: managing an elite club, with the huge budgets, the vast expectations, the array of egos needing constant maintenance (which these days seems to apply to fans as much as players), is a very different job to managing on a shoestring down the leagues.As one Premier League director once put it to me, saying his club should have immediately replaced the manager who had just led them to promotion, you don’t put the bloke who runs the corner shop in charge of a multinational. Which is true, even if the thought that football is somehow too loyal takes some getting used to – a function, as much as anything else, of the financial stratification that exists within the game. Corner shops don’t become multinationals overnight; there is no retail outlet equivalent of winning the playoffs.But then how do you know who can run a multinational? In business, you might promote from within, bring in somebody who’s impressed in a major region. Or you might hope to lure somebody from an equivalent position in a slightly different field. Or you look to somebody in the same field who’s been at a slightly smaller company. But very few football clubs are going to put the head of the academy in charge of the first team, no matter how successful they may have been; they just feel like different jobs. Nor is a football club going to poach Gareth Batty and hope the attributes that made Surrey county champions are transferable to football. And so they look at coaches who have been successes at slightly smaller clubs.And that’s where, if you’re Chelsea, you run into trouble because there are very few clubs slightly smaller than you. If you look to somebody from a similarly sized club, you’re realistically looking at somebody who has failed elsewhere. Or, given the wealth of the Premier League, you’re looking abroad, in which case there’ll always be a question about adaptation to the English top tier. Or, you’re looking down the Premier League table and then there will always be the question of whether the manager is capable of stepping up.Graham Potter’s work at Östersund, Swansea and Brighton was exemplary. He has proved himself clever and adaptable, tactically and emotionally. He was lucky the Chelsea opportunity came a month into this season when Brighton were lying fourth after four wins from their first six games, but that does not devalue his achievements (although it is worth reflecting, for what it says about football’s short-termism as much as anything else, that had Thomas Tuchel been sacked at the end of last season rather than at the beginning of this, Brendan Rodgers would have seemed the obvious candidate).But now, because Potter has never worked at this level before, because he has never handled this level of player before, a run of one win from the past eight Premier League games (and Chelsea weren’t particularly impressive in the three matches before that, even if they were all won), the question is inevitably there: can he hack it with a superclub?Perhaps he can, perhaps he can’t. There were positives from Thursday’s defeat by Manchester City. Chelsea did threaten on the break. It might have been a different game had Carney Chukwuemeka’s shot deflected just inside the post rather than against it, or had John Stones not timed that first-half challenge on Christian Pulisic so perfectly. They did put City under pressure late on. But equally there was a half-hour spell at the beginning of the second half in which City were clearly superior.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballContext, though, provides a lot of caveats. Chelsea were without Reece James and Ben Chilwell and the back-up full-backs are nowhere near their quality. César Azpilicueta is 33 and struggles to get up and down, while Marc Cucurella is suffering what is presumably a crisis of confidence: nervous on the ball and vulnerable to players who run at him, he looks nothing like the player he was at Brighton. N’Golo Kanté, Wesley Fofana and Mason Mount are also injured and Chelsea had lost Raheem Sterling and Pulisic within the first quarter of Thursday’s game.The rest of the squad, in part because of the legacy of the Roman Abramovich era, in part because of the confusion of sanctions and in part because of a mystifying summer transfer spree overseen by Tuchel who was sacked almost as soon as it was over, is a bizarre hotchpotch that lacks coherence. The game was tipped City’s way by two half-time substitutions, and the winner created and scored by two other replacements. When Potter turned to his bench in the second half, he ended up bringing on a pair of players with one Premier League start between them.These would be difficult times for any manager, no matter past experience: it may be that the issue is not Potter but Chelsea. And the question lurking always just out of reach is that if Potter isn’t given time to work this out, if he is rejected before he has had a chance to rationalise the squad and learn about this different level, how can any coach ever come through the British game and make it to the top?",[],
João Palhinha heads late winner as Fulham edge past Southampton,The Guardian,Ed Aarons at Craven Cottage,2022-12-31,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/31/fulham-southampton-premier-league-match-report,"For Southampton these days, it never rains but it pours. A last-gasp header from João Palhinha denied Nathan Jones his first point since taking over as manager after James Ward-Prowse had scored at both ends.The England midfielder’s 15th goal from a direct free-kick in the Premier League – which moved him to within three of David Beckham’s record – had looked like being enough to ensure Southampton would clamber off the bottom of the table. But on an afternoon on which Fulham remembered their George Cohen in their first home match since their former player’s death last week, it was the Portugal midfielder who had the last laugh as Marco Silva’s side moved up to the dizzy heights of seventh.Two floral wreaths bearing Cohen’s first name and his No 2 shirt were placed in the centre circle before kick-off, with Silva joining Cohen’s son and the former manager Roy Hodgson in paying tribute to the 1966 World Cup winner and Pelé on the pitch. While Cohen was part of the Fulham side that spent nine successive seasons in the top flight, it was Hodgson who guided the club to their best-ever finish in 2009, when they came seventh before famously reaching the Europa League final the following year.Whether Silva is capable of scaling those heights remains to be seen despite a brilliant start to their campaign, although he insisted it remains important to keep his players’ feet on the ground. “It’s a good sign we won when it wasn’t our best performance,” said the Fulham ­manager. “But we have to be ­realistic and our targets do not change: we are still fighting to stay in the Premier League.”Having presided over two 3-1 defeats either side of the World Cup break, there had reportedly been some disquiet among the players about Jones’s plans for Southampton to switch to a five-man defence for this match. But having ditched that at half-time, at least the Southampton manager saw his players give everything to find a way back into the game before Palhinha’s killer blow.“It’s really frustrating because we showed we can be a good team at times,” Jones said. “We’re not giving ourselves a chance by defending better from set pieces.”While Southampton have struggled all season, Fulham have already almost banished memories of their two previously unsuccessful attempts at Premier League survival and nearly enjoyed a dream start when Willian volleyed over. But even if the hosts dominated possession, it required a smart save from Bernd Leno to deny Ché Adams after the Scotland striker sprang the offside trap.Southampton’s formation seemed to have disrupted Fulham’s usual fluency in attack as Lyanco kept a close eye on Aleksandar Mitrovic and denied him space. Despite their predicament, the travelling supporters behind Gavin Bazunu’s goal were full of festive cheer and saw the exciting Samuel Edozie hit the target after a brilliant dribble.Their optimism was short-lived, however, as Fulham were ahead within 60 seconds. Armel Bella-Kotchap almost found the net with his clearance from Antonee Robinson’s cross but Willian’s precise corner picked out Andreas Pereira on the edge of the box and his volley took a big deflection off Ward-Prowse before looping into the net.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballIt was exactly the kind of bad luck you don’t need when you’re fighting for survival. Yet things could have been worse had Graham Scott spotted Mitrovic being wrestled to the ground inside the area by Bella-Kotchap.Jones sent his players out into the persistent rain early for the second half having switched formation, with Ainsley Maitland-Niles deployed in central midfield after starting as a right wing-back. Pereira should have doubled Fulham’s lead after Bobby Decordova-Reid’s cross picked him out in the area before Ward-Prowse was presented with a chance to make amends. Leno knew what was coming and saw the ball all the way but still could not stop the Southampton ­captain’s brilliant curling effort.In the end, however, it was to be Fulham’s day as Palhinha headed home a well-worked corner routine at the back post with two minutes to play before Mitrovic saw his penalty saved by Bazunu in injury time.","['It’s a good sign we won when it wasn’t our best performance,', 'But we have to be \xadrealistic and our targets do not change: we are still fighting to stay in the Premier League.', 'It’s really frustrating because we showed we can be a good team at times,', 'We’re not giving ourselves a chance by defending better from set pieces.']",
Smith own goal hands Newcastle win over Bournemouth in Carabao Cup,The Guardian,Louise Taylor at St James' Park,2022-12-20,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/20/newcastle-bournemouth-carabao-cup-fourth-round-match-report,"Shortly after Adam Smith’s own goal gave Newcastle the lead, the Gallowgate End broke into a brief chorus of “We’re going to Wemberlee” but it was strangely half-hearted and soon died in the cool Tyneside night air.By the final whistle Eddie Howe’s side had made it to the quarter-finals but the overall stodginess of the performance explained their fans’ unusual lack of animation. It seems there is still some considerable warming up to be done before they visit Leicester on Premier League business on Boxing Day.“We weren’t at our fluent best but we’ll be better for that game,” said Howe. “We needed competitive action. Bournemouth made it difficult for us, they were very deep and compact and, to a certain extent we played into their hands but part of the reason we struggled to break them down was simply due to not playing together for a while. We know there’s a lot more to come from our team.”One Newcastle player exempt from ring rustiness was Sven Botman who excelled at centre-half, handling Bournemouth’s dangerous Wales striker Kieffer Moore superbly throughout.Avoiding relegation remains Gary O’Neil’s priority but that did not prevent him marking his first game as Bournemouth’s permanent manager by naming a strong side. O’Neil’s only problem was that Howe’s starting XI was similarly packed with regular first choices including a quintet of players recently returned from the World Cup.While Callum Wilson, Kieran Trippier, Nick Pope, Bruno Guimarães and Fabian Schär spent part of the last five weeks in Qatar the rest of Newcastle’s squad have recently returned from a warm weather training camp in Saudi Arabia. Maybe their sluggish start had something to do with the shock of being plunged back into a chill north-east winter? Perhaps everyone was simply defrosting?The excitement fuelled by Newcastle’s rise to third in the top tier allied to a rare cup run, dictated that the “sold out” signs went up at St James’ Park three weeks ago but a near full house had little to cheer until the 26th minute when Wilson’s shot evaded Mark Travers.With a very late linesman’s flag signalling a contentious offside against a prone Joe Willock the applause proved shortlived as that effort was disallowed.Wilson’s attacking partner Miguel Almirón should have scored as half-time beckoned but a forward who could not stop scoring before the World Cup somehow missed from close range following Dan Burn’s stellar overlap.Howe’s side at least succeeded in upping the second-half tempo. Maybe the virus which had ripped through O’Neil’s squad was taking its toll but, with Botman consistently second-guessing Moore and company, Bournemouth ran out of ideas.Yet for all Newcastle’s possession they lacked penalty-area sharpness and very nearly paid for it as Moore’s menacing diving header swerved narrowly wide following Smith’s fine cross.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballShortly afterwards Smith’s head sunk into his hands after his own goal changed the narrative. It originated with a typically impressive right-wing cross whipped in by Trippier and, although that delivery was intended for Wilson, Bournemouth’s captain ended up doing the striker’s job for him.Che Adams scored twice as Southampton marked Nathan Jones' first home match as manager by scraping into the Carabao Cup quarter-finals with an unconvincing 2-1 win over Lincoln. Top scorer Adams struck either side of half-time to spare Saints blushes after the Imps threatened an upset following Gavin Bazunu's early own goal. The lacklustre hosts laboured for much of a forgettable fourth-round tie at a sparsely-populated St Mary's, leaving Jones with plenty to ponder as he plots a Premier League survival mission. Adams' winner - his eighth goal of the season - arrived 16 minutes from time, preventing the jeopardy of a penalty shootout, which Saints had required to sneak past third-tier Sheffield Wednesday in the previous round. Lincoln, who sit 14th in Sky Bet League One and beat Championship Bristol City in round three, acquitted themselves well and will probably leave the south coast feeling aggrieved as replays suggested Adams' 25th-minute equaliser was offside. Saints substitute Samuel Edozie squandered a golden chance to make the result safe in added time when he somehow shot wide of an open goal, while match-winner Adams should have claimed a hat-trick with another excellent opening. With Newcastle’s No 9 seemingly thawing out nicely, Smith was placed under considerable pressure as they jumped for the ball and merely succeeded in heading into his own net.There was still time for Pope to save brilliantly from Dominic Solanke but Howe’s side – who arguably should have had a penalty following Chris Mepham’s apparent handball – had done enough to eliminate his old employers.“I was pleased with our resilience,” said O’Neil. “The boys were competitive against a top side.”","['We’re going to Wemberlee', 'We weren’t at our fluent best but we’ll be better for that game,', 'We needed competitive action.

Michael Carrick happy to continue his quiet revolution at Middlesbrough,The Guardian,Louise Taylor,2023-01-06,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/06/michael-carrick-happy-to-continue-his-quiet-revolution-at-middlesbrough,"Former England midfielder has flown largely under the radar but that will change if his in-form side beat Brighton in FA CupAs a midfielder Michael Carrick was so subtly intelligent that spectators in the stands sometimes barely noticed his consistent success in shaping and controlling games. Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira may have possessed greater physical presence and Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard were definitely more dynamic but Carrick’s technically assured vision prompted valid comparisons to Spain’s Sergio Busquets and Xabi Alonso.Three months into his first managerial posting at Middlesbrough the former West Ham, Manchester United and England anchor is already exerting a similarly understated yet potentially revolutionary effect on this season’s Championship. Carrick appears so quietly unshowy, so modestly down to earth that it is easy to overlook the root-and-branch reform he has undertaken since succeeding Chris Wilder in late October.“We’ve tweaked a few things and it’s snowballed,” says the 41-year-old in his soft Tyneside accent as he sits in Wilder’s old seat at Middlesbrough’s outwardly tranquil Rockliffe Park training ground in the village of Hurworth-on-Tees, a few miles south of Darlington. “We’re flying at the moment.”Until now, his feat in choreographing six wins in Boro’s past seven league games as they have risen from relegation waters to fifth place has gone largely under the radar, but Premier League Brighton are unlikely to underestimate Carrick’s side when they visit the Riverside for Saturday’s third round FA Cup tie.Roberto De Zerbi, the Brighton manager, will appreciate that the former Manchester United coach’s inspired conversion of the previously sidelined former Arsenal striker Chuba Akpom into a goal machine who has scored nine times in his past 10 games is no accident.It seems the tactical acumen of a manager whose replacement of Wilder’s 3-5-2 with a more possession-oriented 4-2-3-1 is just as sharp as the passing range that helped Carrick collect 34 England caps in addition to one Champions League and five Premier League winners’ medals. He also won the FA Cup with United in 2016 but, much as Carrick emphasises his love for the competition, he knows Steve Gibson, Boro’s owner, hired him to return the team to the Premier League – and ideally this season.“I’m a massive fan of the FA Cup; as a kid, watching the final in May was a huge day in the calendar for me and the excitement doesn’t change,” he says. Yet when Carrick is asked whether he is tempted to field a weaker team against Brighton he does not contradict that notion, instead merely body-swerving it. “I don’t think we’ve got a weak team here,” he smiles. “I’m delighted with everybody.“Brighton are a really terrific team, especially in possession, and I’m looking forward to seeing what we do against them when we have the ball. I want to beat Brighton; seeing if you’re good enough to pull it off on big occasions is what you’re in football for. But the measurement for us now is the league and where we end up. It’s all about where we finish the season.”Given that Boro were 22nd at the time of Wilder’s departure the 12-point gap separating them from the second automatic promotion place occupied by Sheffield United is regarded as distinctly surmountable on Teesside. If Boro do go up, Carrick’s decision to appoint Jonathan Woodgate as his first-team coach will have been fully vindicated. Considering Woodgate was sacked as Boro’s manager and replaced by Neil Warnock two-and-a-half years ago it initially looked a slightly left-field recruitment but he and Carrick are tactical soulmates.The former international teammates share a longstanding friendship and Woodgate’s inside knowledge of the squad has proved invaluable. Significantly, the former centre back, who won eight England caps, is credited with helping Dael Fry and Darragh Lenihan forge a formidabledefensive partnership. Both players, Fry especially, had fallen out of favour under Wilder but where Boro’s former manager could be abrasively critical of individuals, Carrick and Woodgate prefer a more emollient, arm-around-the-shoulder approach. Long-serving club staff have been greatly impressed by the manager’s “calmness” and distinctly non-starry “humility”.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballHigh standards are demanded but individuals are spoken to with the sort of sensitivity perhaps informed by Carrick’s experience of a two-year period with depression during his playing days.“I don’t know what went on before but the boys have been great since we started,” says Carrick, who signed the striker Cameron Archer on loan from Aston Villa on Friday. “They’re prepared to listen and apply themselves. When we’ve tweaked things they’ve responded. Everybody understands that successful teams are not about individuals. The attitude and application have been absolutely spot on.”Boro’s new passing game has brought out the best in the 20-year-old academy graduate Hayden Hackney and the ability of Zack Steffen, the United States goalkeeper on loan from Manchester City, to serve as a “sweeper-keeper” is integral to the hallmark build-from-the-back philosophy.Carrick has retained the slender, straight-backed elegance which characterised his playing days but he appreciates he cannot be too rigid, let alone evangelistic, about the team’s modus operandi. “I want to see free-flowing attacking football and we’ve played some really good, easy-on-the-eye stuff but what pleases me is that it hasn’t all been like that,” he says. “In sticky situations we’ve done all sorts; it’s particularly pleasing that we can find a way to win when we have to.”","['We’ve tweaked a few things and it’s snowballed,', 'We’re flying at the moment.', 'I’m a massive fan of the FA Cup; as a kid, watching the final in May was a huge day in the calendar for me and the excitement doesn’t change,', 'I don’t think we’ve got a weak team here,', 'I’m delighted with everybody', 'Brighton are a really terrific team, especially in possession, and I’m looking forward to seeing what we do against them when we have the ball.

"Arsenal must be ‘active’ and strengthen in transfer window, insists Mikel Arteta",The Guardian,John Brewin,2022-12-22,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/22/arsenal-must-be-active-and-strengthen-in-transfer-window-insists-mikel-arteta,"Mikel Arteta believes Arsenal cannot afford to waste the January transfer window that follows the Premier League’s restart. The league leaders lost Gabriel Jesus to a knee injury suffered while playing for Brazil at the World Cup in Qatar, leaving them without a key inspiration behind their five-point advantage over Manchester City.“We are going to be active and active means we are looking to strengthen the team,” said Arteta, whose side’s mid-season break included winning the four-team Dubai Super Cup tournament. “This squad still doesn’t have the luxury of not maximising every single window. We have to do that because it’s really important. But then we have to get the right profile, it has to be the right player to take us to the next level.”Mykhaylo Mudryk, the Ukraine winger, is the player most heavily linked, though Shakhtar Donetsk’s public asking price of €100m may be prohibitive. Reports have put Jesus’s return date as mid-February but his manager refused to set a timescale.“A season has its challenges, and that’s a challenge we have to overcome but if you’re going to be at the top there’s going to be those challenges,” he said. “Knowing him, I prefer not to give any dates. It’s going to take time, for sure. He’s had surgery, that tells you the extent of the injury.”William Saliba returns to training on Friday after he played less than 30 minutes in a walk-on part as France reached the World Cup final, meaning Arteta has a full complement of returnees from Qatar. “They were all fine,” said the manager. “Some came earlier than expected and they were buzzing to be back and part of it. I feel a really good energy around the place. They have got straight away into the rhythm and what we want.”Before Boxing Day’s home match with West Ham, a muscle injury to Reiss Nelson has further reduced Arteta’s attacking options, though Emile Smith Rowe’s return after an injury-ravaged season is imminent. On Nelson, Arteta said: “Reiss, he’s going to be out for a while. I think I’m talking about weeks. He felt something straight away and with sprinters that’s not a good sign.”Before the transfer window opens on 1 January, Arsenal must negotiate West Ham, managed by David Moyes, Arteta’s mentor at Everton, before a New Year’s Eve game at Brighton. Arteta credited Moyes with a “huge impact” on his coaching career. “I am so grateful first of all for the trust he showed in me and how much I learned from him on the field, off the field about building a team, about getting the right characters in the team to build what you want.”During the six-week hiatus, Arteta travelled to the United States to meet the Kroenkes, Arsenal’s owners. “It’s a very special relationship right now to understand the way they think about sports, what they’ve done in other sports and with other franchises. The ambition is there and the alignment is certainly there as well. It’s certainly positive to spend some time together.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballMeanwhile, Fulham are linked with the Arsenal defender Cédric Soares, though Arteta said: “We know where we are in terms of the squad and numbers that we have. We’ll be extremely cautious about what we want to do in the window.”","['We are going to be active and active means we are looking to strengthen the team,', 'This squad still doesn’t have the luxury of not maximising every single window.

The free-kick [got a slight deflection] which made it a bit faster. I was going to take the first penalty but Julian asked me and I said, ‘Of course’. He’s a striker and he needs goals and stuff.Chelsea have lost five of their last seven games in all competitions, and this is the first time they have gone out of the FA Cup in the third round since 1997-98.City will play Oxford or Arsenal in the fourth round after hammering Chelsea at the Etihad. Riyad Mahrez scored two, with Julian Alvarez and Phil Foden getting the other goals. The first half was painfully one-sided, the second a non-event.90 min There will be two minutes of added futility for Chelsea.88 min Chelsea fans have been chanting “We want super Tommy Tuchel!” in the second half. And why not.87 min Joao Cancelo is booked for a City foul on Chalobah. Just before that, Zakaria made another excellent tackle on Mahrez in the Chelsea area. He’s been very good since coming on at half-time.87 min The exciting Rico Lewis has replaced Bernardo Silva.86 min Actually, I was talking nonsense: he just smashed it slightly to the left of centre. From the first angle it looked like he had sprayed it high to the left. Either that or I’m losing it apace.Mahrez spanks an unsaveable penalty into the top-left corner. Why doesn’t he just do that all the time?Riyad Mahrez is going to take this penaltyPENALTY TO CITY! Foden moves through on goal after a lovely reverse pass from Bernardo Silva. Koulibaly tries to win the ball from the wrong side, and Foden goes over. A clear penalty.84 min Apparently Chelsea’s xG today is 0.1.83 min Actually I’m not sure the fans were being thrown out, I think they left of their own accord/despair. I misinterpreted something on the BBC commentary.82 min A few Chelsea fans are being thrown out, I’m not sure why. On the field, Azpilicueta fouls Akanji and then hoofs the ball at the gigantic advertising hoarding in disgust.81 min “Rob,” says Gary Boz, “with your unfavourable mentions of Liverpool, you seem to have solved the mystery of where the LFC of the last four years are hiding - have they currently taken up residence in your head?”Please don’t be weird.80 min Zakaria makes an excellent interception to deny Alvarez, who was moving towards the penalty area. “He’s a good player,” interjects Jermaine Jenas, and it’s hard to disagree on recent evidence.78 min After a confident move from Chelsea, Zakaria’s long-range shot hits Akanji in a babymaking area and loops over the bar for a corner. Chelsea have played okay in the second half, although City have been in second gear.77 min “Might take issue with Potter being a brilliant coach,” says Simon Fuller. “He’ll have seen what happened last season when Tuchel lost James and Chilwell, but when the same thing occurred this season he’s had no clue, no response at all.”I didn’t say he could make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. He’s been there four months, and is only just getting a chance to buy his own players. Everything he did at Brighton suggests he is a top-class coach for clubs who want to build something longer term. Isn’t that why Chelsea wanted him? I found the fact he’s under pressure just bizarre and ridiculous.75 min “To those who think I am a creation of the Guardian MBM staff,” begins Mary Waltz. “1- If they wanted to draw more readers in making me an Everton fan makes no sense, they would be trying to whip up enthusiasm, not depression. 2- These are proper sports journalists, the constant run on sentences and errors in grammar would not keep occurring. 3- The great Romanian soup affair is surely to absurd to be made up.”I don’t know that I’d call it an affair - it’s hardly Profumo, or even Thomas Crown - but I take your point.74 min Hutchinson clips a tame shot wide from the edge of the area.74 min: Chelsea substitution Carney Chukwuemeka replaces Mason Mount.73 min Beautiful play from Mahrez. He leads Gallagher to the right, then shuffles back inside and whips a curling shot this far wide from the edge of the area.70 min Bernardo Silva is booked for a tactical foul on Gallagher.69 min Fofana has done a couple of encouraging things, most notably a bustling on the right that led to … well, bugger all, but that wasn’t his fault.68 min City are passing the ball around, every caress another tweak of the knife that they plunged into Chelsea in the first half. It must be so humiliating for good players to have to dot the Is and cross the Ts on a heavy defeat that was confirmed before half-time.66 min “Considering how much more fluid City are in comparison to the Chelsea game in midweek, Guardiola must be considering whether he should drop Haaland more often,” says Kári Tulinius. “I doubt he’d do it for a crucial match, as he’d be slaughtered, but he must be thinking about it.”This is worth keeping an eye on in the medium-term, absurd as it sounds. You just know Pep’s subconscious is giving all sorts of grief for accepting the offer of a cheat code.63 min: Double substitution for Chelsea: Cesar Azpilicueta and Omari Hutchinson replace Jorginho and Hakim Ziyech.63 min “Afternoon Rob,” says Stephen Carr. “As someone who started as a tricky left-winger who moved to centre-right mid (due to a combination of sciatica and a deep-seated love of a pint) I can say the difference in cuteness with the ball is body shape - or at least it was with me as I really, really loved a pint.”62 min Gallagher gets his obligatory yellow card for flattening Cancelo.60 min Everyone connected with Chelsea just needs to hold their nerve. They haev a brilliant coach - it’s far too early to say whether he has the personality to cope with a job of this size – and maybe a dozen of very talented players aged 25 or under. There’s work to do, and the squad is far too big, but they’re not a million miles away. And based on Chelsea’s modern history, they’ll probably win the Champions League this year.58 min: Double substitution for City Kalvin Phillips and Joao Cancelo replace Rodri and Sergio Gomez.58 min Chelsea are putting a bit more grunt into the second half, with Gallagher leading the way. City are strolling, it’s true, but Graham Potter has at least elicited some response from his players.57 min “Did I see Liverpool mentioned?!?!” says Jeff Sachs, who has bounced back admirably from the disappointment of Darwin Nunez’s goal last night. “I think when a game is so one-sided, there should be an option to stop it early and prevent injuries...”That’d go down well with Twitter’s finest I’m sure.","['We want super Tommy Tuchel!', 'Rob,', 'with your unfavourable mentions of Liverpool, you seem to have solved the mystery of where the LFC of the last four years are hiding - have they currently taken up residence in your head?', 'He’s a good player,', 'Might take issue with Potter being a brilliant coach,', 'He’ll have seen what happened last season when Tuchel lost James and Chilwell, but when the same thing occurred this season he’s had no clue, no response at all.', 'To those who think I am a creation of the Guardian MBM staff,', '1- If they wanted to draw more readers in making me an Everton fan makes no sense, they would be trying to whip up enthusiasm, not depression. 2- These are proper sports journalists, the constant run on sentences and errors in grammar would not keep occurring. 3- The great Romanian soup affair is surely to absurd to be made up.', 'Considering how much more fluid City are in comparison to the Chelsea game in midweek, Guardiola must be considering whether he should drop Haaland more often,', 'I doubt he’d do it for a crucial match, as he’d be slaughtered, but he must be thinking about it.', 'Afternoon Rob,', 'As someone who started as a tricky left-winger who moved to centre-right mid (due to a combination of sciatica and a deep-seated love of a pint) I can say the difference in cuteness with the ball is body shape - or at least it was with me as I really, really loved a pint.', 'Did I see Liverpool mentioned?!?!', 'I think when a game is so one-sided, there should be an option to stop it early and prevent injuries...']",
Arsenal bid for Mykhaylo Mudryk but Shakhtar Donetsk want £85m,The Guardian,Nick Ames,2022-12-26,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/26/arsenal-bid-for-mykhaylo-mudryk-but-shakhtar-donetsk-want-85m,"Arsenal have made a formal offer to Shakhtar Donetsk for the winger Mykhaylo Mudryk, who is their top target in the forthcoming transfer window, although their bid is believed to fall some way short of the Ukrainian club’s asking price.Mudryk, a lightning-quick forward who turns 22 next month, has been a long-term target for the Premier League leaders and has attracted considerable interest from elsewhere too. Brentford were willing to make him their club-record signing during the summer but Shakhtar, notoriously tough negotiators, were unmoved by the Bees’ interest. Arsenal did not join in the bidding but the Guardian understands they have now moved with a view to securing the Ukraine international in January.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballShakhtar will only consider a hefty fee for Mudryk, whose stock rose rapidly over the autumn with a string of impressive Champions League performances. Mudryk scored three times in six group stage games and has added seven in the Ukraine top-flight season, which is currently on its winter break. They would like to receive as much as £85m for a player who is rated among the world’s top attacking prospects but Arsenal are unlikely to go that high.The hope in north London will be that a deal can ultimately be structured in a way that appeals to Shakhtar. Mudryk himself has made no secret of the fact that he would entertain a move and publicly questioned Shakhtar’s valuation last month.",[],

"Transfer latest: Leeds land Wöber, Arsenal bid basic £44m for Mudryk",The Guardian,Fabrizio Romano and PA Media,2023-01-03,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/03/transfer-latest-leeds-sign-max-wober-arsenal-bid-mudryk-chelsea-enzo-fernandez,"Chelsea will step up attempts to hijack Arsenal’s bid for Mykhailo Mudryk by holding talks with Shakhtar Donetsk over the winger on Wednesday.Arsenal are leading the race to sign Mudryk after making a second offer of £44.2m plus add-ons. But Chelsea are interested in the Ukraine international and it is understood negotiations are moving in the right direction. Talks are due to continue with Shakhtar’s director of football, Darijo Srna, in London.It remains to be seen whether Chelsea would be attractive to Mudryk, who appears to have his heart set on Arsenal. However, Shakhtar have been holding out for £85m and Arsenal are yet to go that high. Chelsea could muscle in by offering more money.Chelsea are continuing to try to sign the Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernández from Benfica. Fernández has angered Benfica by returning to Argentina without their permission and told the club again on Tuesday that he does not want to play for them again.The 21-year-old is desperate to move to Stamford Bridge. Benfica are trying to hold on to him until the summer but are likely to let him go if Chelsea make an offer, spread over three instalments, of €127m (£111.9m).Chelsea maintain that they do not want to overpay for Fernández. They are happy to walk away and resume negotiations in the summer if a fee cannot be agreed.Leeds have signed the Austria defender Max Wöber from Red Bull Salzburg on a four-and-a-half-year deal for a fee that could reach €20m (£17.7m) with add-ons. The 24-year-old, who can operate at centre-back and left-back, played under Jesse Marsch at Salzburg and is Leeds’s first January signing.Leeds said: “He now links up once again with head coach Jesse Marsch along with his former Salzburg teammates Brenden Aaronson and Rasmus Kristensen. Wöber will wear the No 39 shirt during his time at Leeds and could feature for the first time in Sunday’s FA Cup third-round tie at Cardiff.”Wöber, who has 13 Austria caps, started at Rapid Vienna and joined Ajax in 2017 before moving to Sevilla, initially on loan, in early 2019. He became the Austrian Bundesliga’s most expensive signing in August 2019 when joining Salzburg and made 125 appearances for the club, winning the Austrian league and cup double three times in a row.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballSouthampton are closing in on the signing of Croatia forward Mislav Orsic from Dinamo Zagreb as Nathan Jones attempts to strengthen the Premier League’s bottom side.

The midfielder is expected to cost around £17m but has also been heavily scouted by Wolves.Leicester have expressed an interest in signing Martin Dubravka after Newcastle terminated the goalkeeper’s loan move to Manchester United early.

Wolves’ Julen Lopetegui unhappy at Liverpool’s longer rest before FA Cup tie,The Guardian,Ben Fisher,2023-01-05,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/05/wolves-julen-lopetegui-unhappy-at-liverpools-longer-rest-before-fa-cup-tie,"Julen Lopetegui has questioned the fairness of Liverpool having two extra days to prepare for Saturday’s FA Cup third-round tie after bemoaning Wolves’ congested schedule. Wolves’ trip to Anfield will be their third game in a testing run of six matches across 23 days.Lopetegui believes Liverpool have a clear advantage because Jürgen Klopp’s side last played on Monday, losing 3-1 at Brentford.

I am sorry but I don’t understand this.”Lopetegui is hopeful the injury that forced Daniel Podence off at half-time at Villa Park is not serious but Boubacar Traoré is set to miss up to two months. Wolves were in the market for a centre-back, right-back and another striker after the arrival of Matheus Cunha but a midfielder is now a priority.“It’s very bad news for us,” Lopetegui said of Traoré’s injury. “We have to improve and balance our squad.

Erik ten Hag urges patience over Jadon Sancho’s return as obstacles remain,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson,2023-01-05,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/05/erik-ten-hag-urges-patience-over-jadon-sanchos-return-as-obstacles-remain,"Erik ten Hag admits he is “impatient” for Jadon Sancho to be available again but will not force the process because hurdles remain in the Manchester United forward’s attempt to regain fitness and the requisite mindset.Sancho has not played since October’s 1-1 draw at Chelsea, after which the manager identified the player’s issues. After being sent to work in the Netherlands with coaches trusted by Ten Hag, Sancho is training at the club’s Carrington base with fringe players.Ten Hag said: “I would like to have Jadon back as soon as possible … I will do everything that’s in my power but some processes you can’t force and this is one of them. So I have also to show patience, although I don’t have the patience because we have a lack of opportunities in the frontline, players who are available and capable to contribute in the Premier League – not only the Premier League but the highest standard of top football.“And Jadon is one – when he is fit. He will contribute and then we have an extra option and so we will have more chance of winning a lot of games.”Ten Hag was unable to specify when the 22-year-old will return. “We have some hurdles to take but I think he’s in a good direction,” he said. “In this moment he is not fit enough, no. I said, physical. But physical is also the connection with mental. He is now making good progress on the physical part and that will help him. I hope he can return quickly but I can’t say how long it will be.”Ten Hag was asked how an elite player could become unavailable when not injured. “Many top athletes, in football and also in other sports, sometimes it’s good to go away from the place where you are at daily to get a new vibe and a new experience,” he said. “People have a different approach and this can give you the right push to get back on track.

Rodgers eyes January shopping spree as stale Leicester look for a refresh,The Guardian,Ben Fisher,2022-12-29,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/29/rodgers-eyes-january-shopping-spree-as-stale-leicester-look-for-a-refresh,"The coach has an exquisite eye for a purchase this time of year and is looking for a winger, left-back and centre-back in the salesIt is 10 years since a challenging first six months in charge of Liverpool came to a head at Christmas for Brendan Rodgers. A couple of weeks on from a home loss to Aston Villa, a bruising Boxing Day defeat at Stoke, which saw them leapfrogged by Tony Pulis’s side and slide towards mid-table, only crystallised the desire for reinforcements. The next month Rodgers recruited Daniel Sturridge from Chelsea and Philippe Coutinho from Internazionale, two crucial pieces in the jigsaw as Liverpool went agonisingly close to winning the Premier League the following season.Before Rodgers takes his Leicester team to Anfield on Friday, he finds himself in a similar pickle, reeling from another Boxing Day defeat but at the same time confident he has pinpointed the areas in his team that urgently need improvement. Rodgers is in no doubt about the additions his Leicester squad require: a speedy winger, a left-back and another centre-back are the priorities for January. That victory at Liverpool would be Leicester’s first win against an opponent in the top 12 of the division this season perhaps speaks volumes of the absence of quality across the squad.A pale performance in the 3-0 home loss to Newcastle prompted Rodgers to take the unprecedented step of cancelling his players’ day off, scheduled for Tuesday, for the first time in his 14-year managerial career. A team meeting helped flush out the worrying performance. Daniel Amartey’s wild swipe gifted Newcastle a third-minute penalty, converted by Chris Wood, and four minutes later Miguel Almirón breezed into the box to double their lead. What made him take such action? “Just the ‘why?’” he says. “Why after the games that we had and the rest that we had and the work that we had, why we started in that manner. We were able to talk it through and open up and conversations like that allow you to move on.”Rodgers was critical of his players’ attitude and it was a difficult display to swallow given Leicester’s form before the World Cup break. They had kept eight clean sheets in their previous 10 matches and their sole defeat in their five league matches before the division was put on pause was a slender one to Manchester City, courtesy of Kevin De Bruyne’s magical free-kick. Rodgers’s words in the buildup to that game felt even more pertinent afterwards. “As we know in football, a pat on the back is only a short distance away from a slap on the backside,” he said. “You’ve got to keep focused.”It was a dispiriting restart for Rodgers and Leicester but he is hopeful his team will not be winded by the defeat. “It’s about rebooting that [confidence] and getting it back again and knowing that the biggest thing in the Premier League you need to have is that attitude and desire to win the games and then the talents then come through from that,” Rodgers says. “I think the players knew and I’ve got a really good group of honest players here who were so disappointed, especially how we had built up into it. But now the next game we have that opportunity to beat the next challenge.”The task for Leicester’s head of recruitment, Martyn Glover, lured from Southampton earlier this year, and the director of football, Jon Rudkin, is to bolster a squad that has gone stale in places. In the summer Rodgers had targeted a healthy shake-up but ended up with one outfield signing, the centre-back Wout Faes, who has impressed and developed into something of a cult hero since signing from Reims following the £75m sale of Wesley Fofana. Leicester’s finances have been smoothed by taking a loan with the Australian bank Macquarie, secured against the £46.3m owed by Chelsea for Fofana. Chelsea will pay another instalment of the Fofana deal in February.Liverpool, of course, is always a special game for Rodgers. The LMA manager of the year award still provides a reminder of how close Liverpool came to clinching the Premier League in 2014, when Manchester City pipped them to the title. Rodgers signed James Milner on a free the next year and reassured Jordan Henderson, amid an offer from Fulham, that he could improve under his watch.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballRodgers made Henderson vice-captain and then captain following Steven Gerrard’s exit. But the January arrivals of Coutinho and Sturridge are equally hard to overlook in Liverpool’s progress. “We started to move and we started to see more of the type of football that I wanted to play,” Rodgers says. Leicester will hope the upcoming winter window provides a similar fillip.","['Just the ‘why?’', 'Why after the games that we had and the rest that we had and the work that we had, why we started in that manner.

‘Contract is just paper’: Manchester City players’ hunger drives Guardiola stay,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson,2022-12-30,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/contract-is-just-paper-manchester-city-players-hunger-drives-guardiola-stay,"Pep Guardiola said the desire Manchester City displayed when beating Liverpool and Leeds was evidence of why he signed a new contract to stay at the Etihad.The wins in the Carabao Cup and Premier League came in City’s first two matches since the Qatar World Cup. Guardiola agreed his fresh one-year deal – with the option of another 12 months until the summer of 2025 – during the tournament and urged his side to continue performing as they did against Liverpool and Leeds when they face Everton on New Year’s Eve.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“It is the results [that matter] – if we are tired of each other then I will not finish this contract,” Guardiola said. “The contract is just paper. If I extend it’s because I have the feeling that we can still play good – like the last two games. We did many good things [in those games] and still have the desire and hunger to do it. When you win a lot, it is easier to handle the situations but on the other side it is: ‘Oh, we have to do it again’. It’s complicated.“You have no idea how people are going to come back from the World Cup. They are in 25 degrees. And then you come here with this weather, immediately to Elland Road against the most intense team in the Premier League. But they reacted really well, I’d say. The commitment made me feel that ‘let’s try to do it again’. If we don’t do that against these opponents then it won’t be possible. That is the challenge: to do it again. What I’m proud of the most is that we are still there. The same in the Carabao Cup, beating Chelsea [the previous round] and Liverpool.”City have an opportunity to cut Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League to two points before Mikel Arteta’s side face Brighton in Saturday’s evening kick-off. Guardiola said the London club deserved to be top at this stage as they attempt to win the title for the first time since 2004 but believes his side have shown the “desire” to push them all the way.“Arsenal have done brilliantly and have been better than us so far. For a long time they have not been there and they want to continue being there,” he said. “Their lead is not 15 or 20 points, we are close. I prefer to be closer but we have not finished the first leg [of the championship]. Winning four in five years and seeing the way we played at Leeds, after the contenders all won, I see the desire. The moment I feel something is broken I will resign or not extend.”Guardiola believes that to retain the title City must keep their focus. “It’s not about Arsenal and Newcastle, it’s about ourselves,” he said. “If you are there it depends on how you perform, not because in the recent decade we were the best team in England.”","['It is the results [that matter] – if we are tired of each other then I will not finish this contract,', 'The contract is just paper.

League Cup: predictions and previews for the quarter-finals,The Guardian,Ben McAleer,2023-01-10,https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2023/jan/10/league-cup-quarter-finals-predictions-previews-manchester-united-charlton-newcastle-leicester-forest-wolves-manchester-city,"The lowdown on Newcastle v Leicester, Manchester United v Charlton, Forest v Wolves and Southampton v Manchester CityBy Ben McAleer for WhoScoredManchester United signed Jack Butland on loan from Crystal Palace last week and he could be thrust straight into the starting XI to give David de Gea a break. Erik ten Hag is without Donny van de Beek, Jadon Sancho and Axel Tuanzebe. Van de Beek would almost certainly have started because Bruno Fernandes has to serve a one-match ban after he received his second booking in the competition against Burnley last month.Christian Eriksen is an able deputy, with Fred likely come into the team alongside Casemiro at the base of the midfield. With the Manchester Derby looming on Saturday, Ten Hag may decide to ring the changes, with Marcus Rashford, Antony, Lisandro Martínez and Luke Shaw likely to be on the bench as United seek to extend their winning run to eight matches in all competitions. Manchester United have not won this competition since 2017 and Ten Hag will see this as a realistic chance to win the club’s first silverware since the José Mourinho era.Charlton, meanwhile, are trying to reach the semi-finals for the first time. The League One side have turned a corner in recent weeks, picking up back-to-back wins over Portsmouth and Lincoln after a run of one win in 10 matches. They are nine points clear of the relegation zone coming into this tie, their first trip to Old Trafford since 2007.Dean Holden has made an immediate impact following his appointment as manager last month and he will be out to claim a huge scalp on Tuesday night. However, he will have to do so without goalkeeper Joseph Wollacott, who is absent owing to a finger injury. Ashley Maynard-Brewer is a doubt due to concussion protocol, having missed Saturday’s win over Lincoln, so Craig MacGillivray could start between the sticks. Chuks Aneke is a doubt owing to a hamstring issue, with Diallang Jaiyesimi and Mandela Egbo missing out entirely. Fortunately for Holden, Sean Clare is available following a ban. Prediction: Manchester United to progressNewcastle were unceremoniously dumped out of the FA Cup on Saturday evening as Eddie Howe named a much-changed XI and they were beaten 2-1 by League One side Sheffield Wednesday. Surprisingly, they have now failed to win any of their last three matches. Howe has called on his team to be “more clinical” after they racked up 22 shots against Wednesday while only scoring one goal. With no European football or FA Cup games to play, Newcastle will be determined to progress in this competition and end their 54-year wait for some silverware. They beat Leicester 3-0 at the King Power Stadium on Boxing Day so will be very confident of reaching the semi-finals.Club-record signing Alexander Isak made his first competitive appearance since September at Hillsborough, though he only managed 45 minutes before his withdrawal and is unlikely to start against Leicester. Newcastle’s injury list has shortened significantly in recent weeks, with Emil Krafth, Jonjo Shelvey and Matt Targett the only confirmed absentees, though Allan Saint-Maximin is a doubt due to illness. Howe should go with a much stronger XI here, with Nick Pope, Bruno Guimarães and Kieran Trippier among those expected to return.While Newcastle have a manageable injury list, the same cannot be said of Leicester, who could be without up to eight players for their trip to St James’ Park. James Maddison is nearing a return but the quarter-final may come too soon for him. Central midfielders Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Boubakary Soumaré have joined their injury list, leaving Brendan Rodgers short of options in the middle of the park.Leicester have been on a poor run recently, losing their last three league games, but their win over Gillingham in the FA Cup at the weekend will give them a morale boost before their trip to Tyneside. Prediction: Newcastle to progressNottingham Forest suffered a shock 4-1 defeat to Blackpool in the FA Cup on Saturday, which was particularly surprising given their strong recent form. They went into that tie on the back of an impressive draw against Chelsea and a win at Southampton. Since their 5-0 defeat at Arsenal in October, Forest have been in solid form, losing only one of their seven matches before their trip to Blackpool.Crucially, they are unbeaten in six at home, and they have already claimed creditable results against Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea at the City Ground this season. Steve Cooper hit out at his squad following their heavy loss on Saturday, and he still has a number of injury issues for their match against Wolves on Wednesday. Jesse Lingard, Moussa Niakhaté, Taiwo Awoniyi, Giulian Biancone, Omar Richards, Cheikhou Kouyaté and Neco Williams all miss out this week.Like Cooper, Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui was left reeling after his side’s FA Cup outing at the weekend, with Wolves requiring a replay to try and take a place in the fourth round due to a dubious offside call. Lopetegui has made a solid start to life at Molineux, with two wins, two draws and one defeat in his first five games in charge.Lopetegui is hoping to have Daniel Podence available for selection after he missed the draw at Anfield on Saturday. Podence was forced off at the break against Aston Villa last week due to injury and will be assessed. However, the Wolves manager is still without Sasa Kalajdzic, Pedro Neto, Chiquinho and Boubacar Traoré. January arrival Matheus Cunha is pushing for his first start after coming off the bench against both Villa and Liverpool. Prediction: Nottingham Forest to progressSouthampton have made a poor start under Nathan Jones following his appointment in November, but they did secure a vital win in the FA Cup on Saturday, beating Premier League opposition Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park to book their place in the fourth round. Southampton’s last three wins have come in cup competitions, with their league form extremely disappointing. A run of one win in 13 league games has seen Saints sink to the bottom of the table, with fans already doubting Jones.The manager needs to build momentum for the second half of the campaign, but he is facing the toughest possible quarter-final. Southampton will be without young centre-back Armel Bella-Kotchap, who is out with a knee injury. Stuart Armstrong is also set to miss out, with Juan Larios, Theo Walcott and Alex McCarthy also absent. Tino Livramento is making good progress following a knee injury, but the game against City comes too soon for the right-back.City beat Chelsea twice in the space of four days to stay hot on the heels of Premier League leaders Arsenal and book their place in the next round of the FA Cup. Their attention now turns to the League Cup, without doubt Pep Guardiola’s most successful cup competition. He won it four years straight in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, but will be wary of Southampton. City have won only two of their last four games at St Mary’s, a subpar record by their lofty standards.Guardiola will be without the services of centre-back Rúben Dias, who picked up a hamstring injury while playing for Portugal at the World Cup – he’s also likely to miss the Manchester Derby on Saturday. That said, City have plenty in reserve and should book their place in the semi-finals.

Graham Potter: ‘Pep was at City for a year before they won anything’,The Guardian,Jacob Steinberg,2023-01-07,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/07/graham-potter-chelsea-criticism-manchester-city-fa-cup,"The Chelsea manager comes out fighting in response to growing criticism and insists: ‘I know the quality I have’It would be no great shock if west London’s third-best team tumble out of the FA Cup on Sunday afternoon. Chelsea, whose stuttering Premier League form has left them in the unfamiliar position of peering up at Brentford and Fulham, are not in a good place before facing Manchester City for the second time in four days.An extensive injury list is pushing an unbalanced squad to the limit, hopes of Champions League qualification are slipping away and, as Graham Potter pointed out after losing to City on Thursday night, some “extreme challenges” are on the way for a club forging a new identity after the tumult of the past 12 monthsWith the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital ownership still finding its feet in English football, it is probably worth forgetting what once held true of Chelsea. In previous times a run of one win in eight league games, plus defeat to City in the third round of the Carabao Cup, would have been enough for a manager to expect an ultimatum from Roman Abramovich. There would have been talk of dressing room unrest, of players going to their Russian owner to voice their feelings, of Guus Hiddink coming to the rescue in an interim role. With Chelsea languishing in 10th place, the pressure on Potter would have been intolerable.Now, though, patience is the aim. Sacking Thomas Tuchel seven games into the new season may suggest otherwise but Boehly and Clearlake want to take a long-term view. “There’s a completely different ownership,” Potter argued. “This is hard for people to get their head around as Chelsea for 20 years has been one thing and now all of a sudden it’s different.”So different, of course, that when Chelsea fired Tuchel their response was not to appoint one of Europe’s elite managers but to approach Brighton for permission to talk to a coach with a history of building successful teams from scratch.“The reason for me to take the job was because you’ve got a chance to shape a club that is in a massive transitional period,” Potter said. “It’s not like I was jumping at the first opportunity to leave Brighton. This one felt right because of the owners, because of the support that they would give. They have been fantastic.”Chelsea’s American owners have been in London this week. They have held talks with Shakhtar Donetsk about their rapid winger Mykhailo Mudryk, who is wanted by Arsenal, and bolstered their defence by signing Benoît Badiashile from Monaco. Money is available. Chelsea, who have annoyed Benfica with their pursuit of their Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernández, spent £200m last summer and are aware that the various weaknesses in their squad have nothing to do with Potter, who was right to say that he continues to enjoy “total support” from the club’s hierarchy.“I understand what’s needed,” Potter said. “I’ve been here four months. If people are going to judge me in that time period, when you consider the challenges we’ve had, that’s fine. I can give you a counterargument in terms of my career and people in the game who would consider my quality.”Potter was unusually animated. The 47-year-old is renowned for his calm on the touchline but he wanted it to be known that he is different in private. “This isn’t actually me all the time,” he said. “Of course there are times where you get angry.” He looked down at the table and picked up a can of water. “It’s not like I’m some robot just speaking to this can all the time.”There was some nervous laughter as Potter talked of dealing respectfully with “stupid questions”. The idea that he could have worked his way up in an industry as ruthless as football without being tough enough to handle a dressing room full of big egos is absurd.Potter knows that Chelsea, who are set to buy the France striker Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig in the summer, need a rebuild. The ageing César Azpilicueta is unsuitable cover for the injured Reece James at right-back. N’Golo Kanté’s hamstring injury has left a void in central midfield, even if Denis Zakaria is playing well, and it is surely time to let Jorginho go when his contract expires.This is not an easy job. In central defence Wesley Fofana is injured, Thiago Silva is 38 and Kalidou Koulibaly has struggled since joining from Napoli. The absence of the wing-backs, James and Ben Chilwell, is taking a toll. Marc Cucurella has filled in for Chilwell on the left but the former Brighton defender does not look like a £60m player.There are too many passengers. Kepa Arrizabalaga still makes too many errors in goal and Kai Havertz remains inconsistent up front. Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic, who is injured, do not produce enough. Raheem Sterling, another absentee, has done little to suggest that City were wrong to sell him. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has one league goal and was subbed on and off against Pep Guardiola’s side.The point is not to make excuses, even though Potter was reduced to bringing on kids against City. His errors include the use of Sterling as a wing-back, which was made to look ridiculous when Chelsea lost 4-1 at Brighton. No Premier League side has earned fewer wins or scored fewer goals across their last eight games than Chelsea, who are yet to develop an identity under Potter.“I’m not sitting here as some egomaniac who has all the answers and gets everything right,” he said. “There are some margins in the Premier League that are difficult. But it’s sort of blah, blah, blah, isn’t it? People want to see results – ‘Shut up, Graham. What are you talking about? We need to win.’”The tone was realistic. While Potter’s job does not hinge on finishing in the top four this season, Boehly and Clearlake will not be patient for ever. The owners are under pressure to deliver, particularly as supporters were so enamoured with Tuchel.Equally Chelsea are paying the price for the shortsighted approach adopted by the previous regime. It is worth remembering that City were nothing special during Guardiola’s first season. What the champions have created, though, is a perfect structure around their manager, ensuring that everything works smoothly on and off the pitch. Chelsea, who have been busy making key hires in their recruitment department, need a similar approach.“The owners are billionaires, so they are quite smart,” Potter said. “Smarter than me, for sure. They understand the direction we want to go in. I’ve been here four months and five or six weeks of that have been lost to international football.

David Moyes accepts he is fighting for his West Ham future amid losing streak,The Guardian,Jacob Steinberg at the London Stadium,2022-12-30,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/david-moyes-west-ham-future-brentford-defeat,"David Moyes admitted that his job is under threat after West Ham’s miserable 2-0 defeat at home to Brentford saw them slip deeper into relegation trouble.West Ham are a point above the bottom three after losing five consecutive league games and Moyes is running out of time to convince the London Stadium club’s board to persist with him.The Scot has done a fine job since returning to the London Stadium for a second spell three years ago but results have been poor this season and his side failed to impress again against Brentford, who moved up to ninth thanks to goals from Ivan Toney and Josh Dasilva.Moyes was realistic after being asked about the speculation over his future. “I don’t think it’s unfair because the business we’re in means that if you go five games when you’ve not won then you could always be under pressure, I totally get that,” he said. “You feel bad when you lose one, when you lose two, never mind five. That is football.“I understand that totally, I only want the best for West Ham because it’s been a great club for me, the club’s done well. We’ve taken it into a better place than it was before so I’m desperate and determined to keep it there. I don’t want it to go back down and get dragged back down.”West Ham spent £160m last summer but now find themselves battling to avoid relegation from the Premier League.“I’m hoping it’s not the case,” Moyes said, on the prospect of his team being dragged into a scrap for survival. “But I’ve got to say I’ve lost a few games here at home recently so we have to be aware that we’re going to have to pick up points somewhere. It’s disappointing that we’ve not picked up any.“We tried to change it tonight, we tried to play a bit better, find a different way and change a few people around to see if it helps, changed the system a bit as well. We are trying to find ways of doing it.”West Ham’s board have been supportive of Moyes, who inspired a run to the Europa League semi-finals last season, but patience could run out if results remain poor. Much will depend on how the east Londoners fare in their next three league games, which are all against fellow strugglers.They visit Leeds on Wednesday and Wolves on 14 January before hosting Everton on 21 January. West Ham also visit Brentford in the third round of the FA Cup.The worry for Brentford was Toney being carried off on a stretcher after suffering a potentially serious knee injury. “It’s unlikely that Ivan is subbed off because of a knock,” Thomas Frank said. “It’s a little bit worrying. We need to assess in the next two days. It could be nothing. It could be worse.”","['I don’t think it’s unfair because the business we’re in means that if you go five games when you’ve not won then you could always be under pressure, I totally get that,', 'You feel bad when you lose one, when you lose two, never mind five.

Moving the Goalposts | ‘Like a rocket’: How Viktoria Berlin are trying to change German football,The Guardian,Júlia Belas Trindade,2022-12-14,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/14/like-a-rocket-how-viktoria-berlin-are-trying-to-change-german-football,"Having set their sights on the Frauen-Bundesliga, the club’s backers are determined to lift the women’s gameWelcome to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian’s free women’s football newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below:FC Viktoria Berlin are an ambitious side. Currently playing in the Regionalliga Nordost in the third tier in German women’s football, they aim to reach the Frauen-Bundesliga in five years – and change the game in Germany while they’re at it.A lot has already happened this year. They are under new management and now separate from the men’s club. It is going to be a long journey but the Frauen at Viktoria Berlin are eager to increase the visibility and profitability of the women’s game using every tool they have. “You have more platforms to reach people, from the old lady who reads the newspaper … to the new generation who don’t watch TV anymore, they’re only on YouTube,” says Ariane Hingst, one of the club’s co-founders and a two-times World Cup winner with Germany in 2003 and 2007.The approach has caught the attention of fans. Home games draw hundreds of supporters, a trend which peaked against Türkiyemspor with an attendance of over 1,700. The match was also broadcast on television, with Der Tagesspiegel reporting a TV audience of 180,000. “It’s a great mix. There are people who are interested in football, but also people who are into female empowerment and want to support it,” Hingst says.The game was the first from the third division to be broadcast on German TV, and they don’t want to stop there. Hingst sees their success as an incentive to other clubs in Berlin and other regions to start looking more closely at the women’s game. “We don’t say: ‘It’s about Viktoria’, we say: ‘It’s about women’s football’, so we put other clubs on board as well,” she says. “I am a competitive person. The bigger the competition, the better the outcome. When you look at the sporting side, we are competitors, but when you look at the big picture, we want to build something together.”The inspiration for this new venture is clear: Angel City FC, the NWSL team owned by the actress Natalie Portman and with a star-studded list of investors. However, there are aspects of the American model that cannot be applied to German football, which has its own rules regarding ownership and investment in football clubs. The main difference is that the club cannot start out in the Bundesliga.“We didn’t want to start in the lowest division and take 20 years to reach the top,” says Hingst. “Viktoria already had a good women’s team and a little bit of a good structure, but no money or manpower to fully support it.” Even though a lot of work has been done over the past six months, she wants to see drastic improvement in women’s football in Germany.“Our first step is to make the first league professional. With our players, they get some money. It’s the first time in their lives. We want to build something step-by-step, but on the other hand, we also have a lot of structural problems. We don’t have our own training facilities or changing rooms. Last year, they wouldn’t know where they would train, because there were two, three different pitches it could be.”The former defender, who also works as an assistant coach for Germany women’s under-19 and under-20 teams, credits the 2022 Euros for increased visibility. Germany reached the final, where they lost 2-1 to England.“We wanted to go live a few months earlier, but it took time until all contracts were signed. It got nuts, and the German team being so successful definitely helped us,” she says. Expectations are even higher for the Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next year. “Next year, I think it’s going to be bigger. We had some highs before, but it wasn’t continuous. So it’s important to maintain the momentum to keep telling these stories.”As a former Germany international herself, born in Berlin, Hingst feels that clubs in the capital should be more supportive of the women’s game. “I’ve never been able to play on the highest possible stage in my home,” says Hingst. “It’s really bad history for a city that claims to be the city for sports, but it only comes down to the men’s sides. It was time to change that.”Since Viktoria’s first match under new management in August, the numbers are impressive. With 11 wins in 12 games they are top of their league, having scored 81 goals and conceded only eight. Run almost like a startup, success on the pitch is important but they also focus on building a brand. The six co-founders also wanted to empower other women through football, from paying players a fixed salary to campaigns to raise awareness about the gender pay gap with sponsors. So far, it’s paying off.“Our story started like a rocket and is in full speed,” says Hingst. “I’m from the sports side, then we have a marketing expert, a financial expert, a media expert, and two who come from the business side. So it’s already quite interesting that we put together a group where each one had the point they were good at.”Out of the current 87 investors, Hingst believes over 80% are women from different fields, from politics to economics and entertainment. She feels her sporting experience can also come in handy in helping players navigate the game.Sign up to Moving the GoalpostsInformative, passionate, entertaining.

Arsenal shake off rust as forwards deliver Boxing Day win,ESPN,James Olley,2022-12-26,https://www.espn.com/soccer/english-premier-league/story/4838647/arsenal-stay-atop-premier-league-table-as-front-line-steps-up-to-deliver-win-over-west-ham,"Don Hutchison and Julien Laurens explain what Mykhailo Mudryk could bring to Arsenal.

- Premier League table | Upcoming fixturesSaid Benrahma put the Hammers in front with a 26th-minute penalty after William Saliba fouled Jarrod Bowen in the box before second-half strikes from Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Eddie Nketiah sealed an important victory.JUMP TO: Player ratings | Best/worst performers | Highlights and notable moments | Postmatch quotes | Key stats | Upcoming fixtures1. Arsenal's momentum continues following World Cup breakBy the end, it was like they had never been away. Arsenal made a slow start Monday in falling behind even though that Benrahma goal came against the run of play. Saliba's sloppiness seemed to encapsulate fears that the timing of the World Cup could affect Arsenal more than most Premier League sides given they had exceeded all expectations to top the table in the first part of the campaign.Yet they stuck to the task admirably with the zest and energy in their attacking play rewarded with a stirring second-half comeback which ensures the feel-good factor around Emirates Stadium continues. As if to aid the segue from World Cup to domestic action, former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger -- now FIFA's head of global football development -- was in attendance for the first time since leaving the club in 2018. Wenger may have departed amid deep divisions in the fanbase over his latter-day management, but he received a hero's welcome here.The Gunners have never looked more robust in the four and a half years since he left. Time will tell if Arsenal can last the pace to land their first league title since 2004 (under Wenger) but a seven-point lead at this stage is very encouraging.2. Arsenal front three step up in Jesus' absenceThe biggest unknown here was how Arsenal would cope without Gabriel Jesus. The 25-year-old striker is out for up to three months following knee surgery, leaving Nketiah to lead the line in his absence alongside Saka and Martinelli. It feels particularly poignant that on a night when questions were asked about the Gunners' potency without their star man, all three attacking players found the net.Saka's goal relied on a moment of good fortune as Martin Odegaard dragged a shot straight into his path, but the England winger's composure to steer a low shot past Lukasz Fabianski was exemplary. Martinelli showed great determination and speed to fire a shot inside Fabianski's near post, although the West Ham goalkeeper was beaten far too easily. And then Nketiah had his moment, turning Thilo Kehrer with embarrassing ease before steering a low shot into the net.Further reinforcements are needed -- they have submitted a bid worth up to €65 million for Shakhtar Donetsk winger Mykhailo Mudryk's transfer -- but this was evidence losing Jesus until the spring does not necessarily have to be the devastating blow it appeared at the time.3. Moyes' wretched run continuesDavid Moyes is now winless in 71 Premier League away matches as a manager against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United, losing his 50th such game Monday. In fairness, the majority of those matches have come while in charge of teams that start such fixtures as second favourites, but this was a typically conservative approach from Moyes which never really got out of second gear, even when West Ham took the lead.They were happy to defend on the edge of their own box and looked to hit on the counter-attack -- a gameplan which allowed Arsenal time to establish their rhythm and eventually overwhelm their opponents in the second half. They never looked like getting back into it after going behind, and despite the good job Moyes has done in his second stint at the club, criticism will only grow after a result which leaves them just a point outside the relegation zone.""Sometimes you have dips and at times like that you need the board and everyone to stick together,"" Moyes said before the game. He needs that a little more now.Arsenal: Aaron Ramsdale 6, Ben White 6, Gabriel Magalhaes 6, William Saliba 6, Kieran Tierney 6, Martin Odegaard 9, Thomas Partey 7, Granit Xhaka 7, Bukayo Saka 8, Eddie Nketiah 7, Gabriel Martinelli 8.

Garnacho’s talent will shine through as he matures at Manchester United,The Guardian,Will Unwin,2022-12-24,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/24/alejandro-garnacho-talent-will-shine-through-as-he-matures-at-manchester-united,"The 18-year-old may have had his professionalism brought into question but there is no doubting his ability on the pitchPlaying is all that matters to Alejandro Garnacho and when he does not, that is when frustration kicks in. No one who has seen him on the pitch could ever doubt his ability but the Argentinian has faced public criticism over his attitude this season.Last month Manchester United’s head coach, Erik ten Hag, issued a warning, shortly after his teammate Bruno Fernandes looked back to the summer trip to Thailand and Australia and said: “On the tour he didn’t have the best attitude that he should have had,” arguing that was behind his lack of opportunities early in the season. Garnacho turned up late to two meetings and was offered only one friendly appearance over the summer as a result.Professionalism is not a concept fully embraced by many 18-year-olds but it should come with maturity and an improvement in his attitude has already been noted since Ten Hag’s critique. Just because a person is incredibly talented does not automatically mean they will acquire every aspect required for success immediately but the sooner he does get to the standards required, the better it will be for Garnacho in the long term.The perceived character flaws away from the pitch go against what he shows on it. Garnacho has a lust for football, a desire to play every minute to show everything he is capable of because of his unshakable belief in his own ability. Not being a regular in a top-six Premier League team at 18 would not be a source of frustration for many but Garnacho is already desperate to prove he is the best option for Ten Hag on the left wing. What he needs to accept, however, is that at his tender age he does not possess everything required.What is obvious is that Garnacho comes alive with the ball at his feet, which comes as no surprise for someone that loves football as much as the Argentinian does. He is desperate to get possession whenever he can and run fearlessly at defenders, unperturbed by previous failures against his opponents. There is speed and skill, a new trick for every dribble to try to outfox a full-back who thinks he has his number. However there is still a need to learn how and when to use each attribute. He needs to know that sometimes the quickest way to goal does not always involve an extra trick, because the space is straight ahead when someone has the pace, as shown by Garnacho’s direct dribbling to score against Real Sociedad. That finish and his late winner against Fulham in the Premier League are evidence of his composure and unfazed nature in pressured situations.Garnacho has improved his running without the ball, to make sure he is in the right position to receive it in order to have maximum impact in the final third, and is excellent in attacking transitions. Understanding he is not the finished product is important and the former Atléticp Madrid youth player recognises this. He works incredibly hard on the training ground to get better in the aspect of the game he is yet to perfect. Since arriving in 2020, Garnacho has been following a development plan and exceeded expectations in the process. United have been understanding of his prodigious talent, which needs to be handled differently to others.Aided by a robust physicality, Garnacho will be able to cope with the rigours of the Premier League in the long term. He is unfazed by the cut and thrust of first-team football, instead he embraces it. In the immediate future he is still adapting to the requirements of playing at the highest level for 90 minutes. There is nowhere to catch his breath in the relentless nature of being at a club such as United, who play twice a week.Last season Garnacho was the shining star in United’s FA Youth Cup triumph under the tutelage of Travis Binnion, scoring seven times in the competition, including two in the final against Nottingham Forest to help lift the trophy. Throughout the competition, he was the player the under-18s could rely on to produce quality. As an indicator of the confidence he has in his own ability, he told coaches he would score a double in the final, a prediction he was happy to fulfil in front of more than 60,000 at Old Trafford.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballThat came a fortnight after making his Premier League debut in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford. Argentina called him up for internationals in March, which is an impressive endorsement of a then 17-year-old. A week training with his idol Lionel Messi and a squad of soon-to-be World Cup winners could be a cynical way to put Garnacho off returning to play for Spain, whom he represented at youth level before switching allegiances to the country of his mother’s birth.United are looking into bringing in another forward in January after Cristiano Ronaldo’s unceremonious exit and with Jadon Sancho having been on an individual training plan away from his colleagues during the World Cup break. Garnacho has the chance in the coming weeks to show he can be consistent in the starting XI in what will be an intense period for clubs and individuals, meaning professionalism levels will need to be heightened to manage the number of games in a small space of time.Garnacho, who turns 19 in July, will not be defined by what happens in the next six months of his career, but it will be another crucial learning exercise under Ten Hag. If a teenager’s attitude is the only thing to worry about, the linear nature of time should ensure Garnacho makes the most of his unquestionable talents.","['On the tour he didn’t have the best attitude that he should have had,']",
Rodrigo rescues point for Leeds as West Ham’s winless woes roll on for Moyes,The Guardian,Louise Taylor at Elland Road,2023-01-04,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/leeds-west-ham-premier-league-match-report,"Jesse Marsch says the stress of life as Leeds manager is so intense that, at times, he hates his job. Not to be outdone, David Moyes claims to have “loathed every minute” at the helm of West Ham in recent weeks.Both men say there are also times when they love their positions but this was a night when they had to settle for reasonable contentment in the form of a messy yet gloriously feisty draw which, in ending the visitors’ run of five consecutive Premier League defeats, left Marsch frustrated.With goal difference separating his side from the bottom three, Moyes’s job security remains gossamer thin and he had reason to be relieved his opposite number had not started Jack Harrison, a transformative second-half substitute.“It was a step in the right direction,” said West Ham’s manager. “I was very pleased with our resilience after going 1-0 down. It was a good result but a missed opportunity. We should have had more control – and won.” Moyes also paid a heartfelt tribute to David Gold, West Ham’s co-chairman who died on Wednesday. Leeds placed a bouquet of flowers on the empty seat he occupied on visits here.Another David, the one patrolling Elland Road’s away technical area, has become overly familiar with defeat of late yet Moyes clearly sensed opportunity against a defence so porous relegation remains a real peril. Perhaps this mutual fear of a Championship future explains why the two managers greeted each other unusually warmly, exchanging hugs, handshakes and words before kick-off.Marsch – who confirmed that a tearful Mateusz Klich, a second-half substitute, is leaving for MLS – hopes Max Wöber will prove the answer to his problems but the £10m left sided Austria defender arrived from Red Bull Salzburg too late for involvement.As Wöber was paraded on the pitch before kick-off he insulated himself from the West Yorkshire chill by zipping his club anorak up to the neck but Declan Rice had no protection when an, albeit accidental, kick in the face from Rodrigo left West Ham’s England midfielder requiring treatment on a cut ear.Rodrigo was subsequently booked and could count himself slightly fortunate not to have been sent off for an unintentional but potentially damaging challenge.At that point both teams seemed a bit short on identity. The lack of discernible style dictated there were periods when things became so incoherently helter-skelter that it all seemed a giant exercise in improvisation.Everything changed when Wilfried Gnonto reminded us why he scored his first senior goal for Italy at the age of 18 and Crysencio Summerville showed off the class that has made him a Netherlands Under-21 winger.Gnonto, now 19, reduced Lukasz Fabianski to helplessness courtesy of a sublime, left footed, finish after meeting Rodrigo’s flick and playing a one-two with Summerville. The latter’s contribution, the most subtle of disguised chipped passes, thoroughly confounded Moyes’s rearguard.Briefly, West Ham, with Thilo Kehrer struggling in defence, seemed set to surrender but then Illan Meslier raced well out of his area to clear, allowing Vladimir Coufal to try his luck from 45 yards. Moyes looked suitably resigned as the ball eventually landed tamely on the roof of the net.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballWhen Pascal Struijk tripped Jarrod Bowen in the area, things finally looked up for the Scot as, thanks to VAR, a penalty was awarded . Although Lucas Paquetá’s elaborate run up did not convince his spot kick – expertly lifted into the top corner – defied Meslier and parity was restored.Forty three seconds into the second half the previously anonymous Italian striker Gianluca Scamacca intercepted Brenden Aaronson’s slapdash attempted pass as he took a swivelling, steadying touch before sending a low shot curving in off a post. With a swipe of a boot from the edge of the area West Ham were ahead. As a forlorn Marsch stared up at the sky, Scamacca celebrated making the very most of one of Leeds’s alarmingly frequent concessions of possession.“I’m very frustrated and confused that it took so long for my players to play to their potential,” said Marsch. “The first half wasn’t good enough, I have to learn how to push the right buttons.”With boos now audible audible, Coufal and Summerville became embroiled in an unpleasant altercation and heavy rain began cascading down.Rodrigo lifted the mood by switching the soundtrack to “Marching on Together” courtesy of a finely calibrated equaliser, beautifully struck from 20 yards after his collection of Harrison’s pass. It was his 10th goal of the season and a vindication of Marsch’s decision to replace Aaronson with the immensely impressive Harrison.Indeed but for Fabianski’s wonderful save from Rodrigo’s header at the death the Leeds manager might have ended the evening back in love with his job.","['loathed every minute', 'It was a step in the right direction,', 'I was very pleased with our resilience after going 1-0 down.

Marcus Rashford caps Manchester United’s stroll against Bournemouth,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson at Old Trafford,2023-01-03,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/03/manchester-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report,"Manchester United keep purring along impressively under Erik ten Hag. This fourth consecutive Premier League win – and third clean sheet in a row – takes them up to 35 points and with Manchester City next at Old Trafford in the competition on Saturday week the manager and his team will hope to be as irresistible then.United are only a point behind City, who have played one fewer games, yet Ten Hag shrugged off the question of whether his side are in the title race. “The belief is growing,” he said. “But that is a big step. So, no. We have to go from game to game and make progress. Don’t get too far ahead as it is January – not even half a season.”As a perfectionist the Dutchman did find fault. “We scored great goals and we should have scored even more but we could have conceded one or two and I am not happy with that because David [De Gea] had to make good saves,” the 52-year-old said. We have to play more smart so that is the next step we have to make.”Ten Hag’s back five of David de Gea, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelöf and Luke Shaw had a retro feel about it – as if the current manager had invited his predecessor, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, to guest select tonight’s defence.A mark of an elite team is the ability to switch personnel and yet its structure and style remain. A solitary victory in nine previous league outings made Bournemouth ideal guinea pigs to test an XI featuring four new selections – Donny van de Beek was the other – plus what was an altered rearguard alignment, Shaw moving to left-back from centre-back, where he operated against Wolves.When Bruno Fernandes switched the ball to Shaw and he dropped it on to Anthony Martial’s head, the latter misdirected but this was a promising sign. As was how Casemiro raced back to slide-tackle Philip Billing: a free-kick was awarded – a little unkindly by Michael Salisbury – and justice was done when Jaidon Anthony blasted it wide.United were suffocating Bournemouth and, after Marcus Rashford powered along the left and was tugged back, they scored from the free-kick: Christian Eriksen dipped the delivery on to the boot of Casemiro, who volleyed in.Advantage United but the way they slumbered at a short corner, allowing Dominic Solanke a free header which he spurned, was an alarm call. United soon had Rashford charging down the right and Billing yanking over Casemiro for a foul. Eriksen fired the free-kick at goal but the visitors’ wall rescued them.The half ended sourly for Van de Beek who was run into by Marcos Senesi and replaced by Alejandro Garnacho. ‘We have to wait 24 hours before we can give a good diagnosis. It is a concern,” Ten Hag said.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballGarnacho began the second period by burning past Adam Smith and the lightning-fast youngster was to have a cameo role in a breathtaking United second that starred a buccaneering Shaw. The full-back began and ended the move, zipping at Bournemouth, passing to Fernandes who fed Garnacho. The 18-year-old crossed and there was Shaw, who finished with his right foot.More enticing fluidity arrived when Martial dropped deep and skimmed the ball out wide, Casemiro eventually received the ball and his chip was headed wide by the French striker. United were strolling, as they did in last week’s 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest, but Bournemouth were not finished. Twice De Gea had to save his side – with a hand to a Billing header and, later in the same phase, by repelling an Anthony effort.On 68 minutes Martial was replaced by Anthony Elanga, the former heading straight for the tunnel. Ten Hag was optimistic about his No 1 centre-forward being unscathed. “Yes, I think so. You have seen he got a knock but he continued the game and then came off,” he said.Garnacho provided a moment of wonder when dipping a shoulder and clipping Mark Travers’ left post. Then Rashford slotted in from a Fernandes pass for the coup de grace for a United who at the moment can do nothing wrong – next up are Everton in the FA Cup.","['The belief is growing,', 'But that is a big step.

Gakpo to Gvardiol: how the January window is looking for transfer targets,The Guardian,Fabrizio Romano,2022-12-24,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/24/gakpo-to-gvardiol-how-the-january-window-is-looking-for-transfer-targets,"Premier League clubs are gearing up for the new year sales but the winter World Cup could hike individual price tagsPSV’s plan was to let the Netherlands international move in the summer but after his exceptional World Cup he has a chance to leave in January. Erik ten Hag is a big fan and Manchester United remain interested, making contact with the 23-year-old’s agents. Negotiations between the clubs have not started, though, and it depends on how much United are willing to invest in a forward. PSV wanted €50m last summer but are now demanding more than €60m.Chelsea are pushing again to sign the 20-year-old but there is also interest from Manchester City and Real Madrid. The question is whether the Croatia centre-back, who can also play at left-back, moves in January or next summer. Chelsea bid €80m at the end of August, with a view to Gvardiol staying on loan at Leipzig for another season. The asking price has gone up to more than €90m.A deal is imminent for the 20-year-old to join Chelsea, who will pay the Norwegian club about €12m and give Fofana a five-year deal. Chelsea are deciding whether the Ivory Coast international should stay with them or go on loan but the deal has been agreed by the clubs and with the player.The Ukrainian is Arsenal’s priority target and wants to join the Premier League leaders but the other important consideration is what happens between the clubs because Shakhtar want more than €65m-70m and Arsenal want to pay less. Contacts are ongoing.The 37-year-old has been training since the World Cup to be in the best possible shape and is waiting for an opportunity in Europe after leaving Manchester United. He has an offer on the table from the Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr worth €200m a season until June 2025 with commercial deals included.Dortmund are negotiating with the 18-year-old in the hope of extending his contract beyond the summer but are yet to make an offer that satisfies Moukoko. The Germany international has a great relationship with his manager, Edin Terzic, and would be happy to stay but Dortmund need to act fast because Premier League clubs will push to sign him if no agreement is reached.The Portugal international is open to leaving and Atlético are willing to listen to offers but will start with an asking price of more than €100m. There will be discussions with Félix’s agent, Jorge Mendes, in the coming weeks to try to bring proposals from English clubs or Paris Saint-Germain. There is a good chance the 23-year-old will move but it is too early to say where.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballFiorentina will demand €40m for the Morocco international after he shone at the World Cup. Tottenham wanted Amrabat last January and Antonio Conte remains a big fan but Spurs are happy with Rodrigo Bentancur so nothing is advanced there. Liverpool are tracking the 26-year-old but a lot of other clubs also like him and it will not be an easy deal given the asking price.Chelsea are open to letting Ziyech go if they receive the right offer for a permanent transfer – a loan does not interest them. Milan are not negotiating to sign him, contrary to rumours, but talks were held last summer.The Argentinian had a fantastic World Cup and a number of clubs, notably in the Premier League and La Liga, are interested. Liverpool and Chelsea are among those tracking him but this does not look a straightforward transfer because Benfica would like to keep their two biggest players: Fernández and the forward Gonçalo Ramos. Fernández has a €120m release clause.",[],
Sheffield Wednesday spring shock by putting Newcastle out of FA Cup,The Guardian,Sam Dalling at Hillsborough,2023-01-07,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/07/sheffield-wednesday-newcastle-fa-cup-third-round-match-report,"This was the sort of evening from which this competition has for so long earned a living. The sort of night when an old, somewhat unloved but far from unloveable mash of iron and concrete erupted twice courtesy of Josh Windass.The sort of 90 minutes during which Premier League high flyers, perhaps guilty of underestimating their opponents, are continually wasteful, a malaise summed up by a woeful effort from Chris Wood. It drew wild cheers from one set of supporters and a barrage of expletives from the other.From there it seemed clear that Newcastle would be exiting this competition early to lower-league opposition. Bruno Guimarães’s effort proved a mere consolation.The credit must go to Sheffield Wednesday, though. Darren Moore’s remit for the season is very much about leaving League One at the right end, but a Cup run can only help. “A special night,” he said. “I’m really pleased we put that performance on in front of our fans. We asked them to be loud and vocal and they played their part tonight.”Windass will get the headlines but it was also a stellar evening for the homegrown goalkeeper Cameron Dawson. He has never properly established himself as Wednesday’s first-choice but Moore’s decision to have him replace David Stockdale – who had already kept 11 clean sheets in the season – in mid-December is proving correct.“It’s hard to single people out but he was excellent,” said Moore. “He made some really big saves so I’m really pleased for him.”Before the pre-match light show, photosensitive supporters were advised by Wednesday’s official website to “show caution before entering the stadium”. It is a message Eddie Howe ought to have relayed to Newcastle, who began shakily.Hillsborough itself would have shaken had Liam Palmer’s early drive not flashed wide. Jacob Murphy, who squandered possession with a poor touch, breathed a sigh of relief. Elliot Anderson was next to avoid Howe’s glances when a sloppy no-look back-pass had neither the weight nor the direction to reach Martin Dubravka. Windass arrived first but poked wide.In mitigation, Newcastle were much changed, with only three of those who began Tuesday’s draw at Arsenal starting here. Howe put the changes down to fatigue among his regulars and said: “It’s a team I thought was strong enough at the start of the match. We just weren’t clinical in front of goal.”One sight that buoyed the away fans was that of Alexander Isak. On his first appearance since September, the club’s record signing looked as dangerous as he was rusty during his 45 minutes of action.Early on he peeled away and nodded Javier Manquillo’s cross goalward. Dawson palmed away. The same pair combined again before the break, Manquillo cutting in from the right to play Isak in. The strike was straight at Dawson. Touch and movement both there, but instinct lacking. He was replaced at the break.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballBut for all Newcastle’s possession, they lacked fluency. Wednesday, themselves on an unbeaten 13-match league run to match their opponent’s, were attentive, industrious and just the right side of edgy.Their first came soon after the break, a moment of quality from George Byers earning him some space in the midfield. He found Palmer, who in turn found the recently introduced Dennis Adeniran. Windass, who was not properly attended by Jamaal Lascelles, finished. Had VAR been in operation the goal would not have stood.Anderson should have levelled immediately, Dawson again saving with his legs. Howe had seen enough. On came Guimarães, Joe Willock and Miguel Almirón.But the calvary failed to prevent Wednesday from doubling their lead. Windass was sent away by Michael Smith – a product of Tyneside’s famous Wallsend Boys Club – and curled a lovely finish past the helpless Dubravka.Moore was a picture of calm, unlike the majority of north Sheffield. “I think that’s Josh’s most complete performance, since I’ve been here,” he said.There was, though, a nervy ending. Joelinton, through sheer persistence, earned a corner. Howe used the break in play to introduce Kieran Trippier, whose corner was flicked on by Wood and tucked in by Guimarães. Had VAR been in operation the goal would not have stood. All square on that front then.Windass was a bar’s width from finishing the tie; Willock was a Mark McGuinness intervention from levelling it. Wood should have done better after more industry from Joelinton. Instead, from just inside the area he spooned high and wide. And so home supporters sang the blues.","['A special night,', 'I’m really pleased we put that performance on in front of our fans.

"Darwin Núñez ‘unstoppable’ despite frustrations in front of goal, says Klopp",The Guardian,Ben Fisher at Villa Park,2022-12-26,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/26/darwin-nunez-unstoppable-despite-frustrations-jurgen-klopp-liverpool-aston-villa,"Jürgen Klopp reiterated his confidence in Darwin Núñez after Liverpool’s 3-1 victory at Aston Villa, praising the Uruguay striker’s unselfish streak and insisting his £85m record signing is an “unstoppable” force despite his frustrations in front of goal.Mohamed Salah equalled Kenny Dalglish’s Liverpool goalscoring mark to open the scoring with his 172nd strike for the club. Núñez missed a golden chance to get on the scoresheet but played a pivotal role in the buildup to the 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic’s first Liverpool goal, which capped the scoring.“It’s not as though he can close his eyes and hit the ball in,” Klopp said. “The scoring in the beginning is not so important. I am not since yesterday in the business and so I know. When you look back, you cannot imagine how many big chances [other strikers] they made in the beginning. We are completely calm.“What I really love and what is so special is that in the third goal pretty much everyone in the room, we would have all hammered the ball down and tried to force it. The workrate he put in, the depth he creates for us, he is unstoppable in the moment, there is no defender who can really catch up speed-wise. I know all of the stories around, it is completely fine. He played an exceptional game tonight and we won 3-1, that’s all that counts.”Klopp said Liverpool must remain a “pain in the backside” for their top-four rivals after they moved within five points of fourth-placed Tottenham with a game in hand after recording a third straight league win. Klopp described the Spain-born Bajcetic, whose Serbian father, Srdan, played for Red Star Belgrade, as “cheeky like hell”.

Graham Potter admits current Chelsea challenge is biggest task of his career,The Guardian,Sam Dalling,2022-12-30,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/graham-potter-admits-current-chelsea-challenge-is-biggest-task-of-his-career,"The Chelsea manager, Graham Potter, believes he is in the midst of the most “challenging” spell of his managerial career. Tuesday’s 2-0 victory over Bournemouth – secured by Kai Havertz and Mason Mount goals – ended a six-game domestic winless run, and was particularly pleasing given Potter was without eight senior players.“It’s been a really tough period, as challenging as there has been in my time as a coach,” Potter said. “But you know, we’re Chelsea and people don’t want to hear those reasons, stroke excuses. You’ve got to get on with it and try your best to find the answers.”Despite the positive result Potter suffered a further injury blow with Reece James withdrawn early in the second half after a recurrence of the knee injury that caused him to miss the World Cup. It was James’s first appearance since limping off against Milan in October.With N’Golo Kanté and Wesley Fofana both recently having experienced setbacks as they approached returns, Potter was asked whether Chelsea’s long absentee list was purely down to bad fortune.“I don’t think you should completely throw it to something that you can’t do anything about,” he responded. “There’s an element of luck of course, and then there’ll be other things, like I said, that happen. But that’s for us to try to learn from and try to get better with. It’s been a challenging season. I don’t know how pre-season was. I wasn’t here so I can’t comment.”Chelsea travel to second-bottom Nottingham Forest on New Year’s Day. All three of Steve Cooper’s side’s top-flight wins to date have come at the City Ground, so Potter expects a difficult afternoon.“You always have to be wary in the Premier League,” he said. “You can’t say on the one hand that it’s the greatest league in the world and then think there’s easy games.

The Serie B club announced the news on Friday, some 31 years after he first left the club, with Ranieri saying: “We are bound by mutual respect and love.”The charismatic 71-year-old is best known in England for guiding Leicester to a fairytale Premier League title in 2016, but he failed to work his magic at his last club, Watford, as they earned only seven points in three months before he left the job in January.In a statement, Cagliari said he returns “to write a new chapter in history … welcome back, Mister, how nice to hug you again!”Ranieri told the club website: “I’m going back to Cagliari: I’ve always known it, I declared it even then, at the time of my departure. Cagliari made me understand that maybe I could make it in my job, I had found all the elements that helped me in those three years: fans, players, managers, we were all one.“In these days you have helped me make this decision, which was not easy for various reasons.

Antonio Conte says he is happy but hints he may leave Tottenham,The Guardian,Sachin Nakrani,2023-01-03,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/03/antonio-conte-says-he-is-happy-but-hints-he-may-leave-tottenham,"Antonio Conte has insisted he is happy at Tottenham but warned he will have to leave if he can no longer accept the club are unlikely to win the Premier League or Champions League any time soon.Conte’s contract expires at the end of the season and performances and results since the World Cup have cast fresh doubt on his remaining beyond then. An unconvincing 2-2 draw at Brentford on Boxing Day was followed by an insipid 2-0 home defeat by Aston Villa, leading to audible fury from supporters and the head coach calling for realism about expectations given the resources at his disposal. He went as far as describing last season’s top-four finish as a “miracle”. Not for the first time since he arrived in November 2021, the Italian appeared fed up with his lot.Speaking before the visit to Crystal Palace on Wednesday, Conte denied that was the case, making clear he remains on board with the “big challenge” assigned to him when he replaced Nuno Espírito Santo. He said a fundamental part for all concerned was to show patience in regards to how long it will take Spurs to land a major trophy, having not won anything since 2008. He again refused to say when that was likely to be and, for the first time, admitted he may well reach a point soon where he cannot continue to wait.“My task is to help the club, to create a base, and then to try to improve,” he said. “If you say to me, ‘The challenge for you is to win the Premier League, to win the Champions League’, this is not the task in this moment.“I signed a contract in November [2021] and found the club in a difficult position for many reasons. Now my task – I understood it very well – is to help the club go in the right direction about the choices of the players, about the work, to organise and to create a foundation. This is my big challenge here. If I want to stay here, then I have to accept this. Otherwise, if I don’t want to accept this, then I have to go.”Spurs retain an option to extend Conte’s contract by 12 months and have reportedly spoken to him about a fresh deal that includes a £1m-per-year salary rise. The 53-year-old has given no indication regarding when he will make a decision on his future, the widely held belief being he will see how how this campaign pans out. Spurs are fifth in the Premier League and into the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will face Milan. They begin their FA Cup campaign at home to Portsmouth on Saturday having exited the Carabao Cup at Nottingham Forest in November.Judging by the mood at Tottenham on Sunday, a portion of the fanbase are fed up with Conte’s tactics, which at best can be described as cautious and, at worst, defeatist. Many of those who made their feelings felt in person have also had enough of the owner, Daniel Levy, chanting for him to “get out of our club”.“Honestly, I did not hear this,” Conte said when asked whether criticism of Levy was fair. “All I can say is it is important in this moment to have togetherness between fans, players, club.

Should Harry Kane already be England’s leading goalscorer? | The Knowledge,The Guardian,Guardian sport,2023-01-04,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/should-harry-kane-already-be-england-leading-goalscorer-knowledge,"Plus: World Cup-winning centre-back pairs at club level, testimonial misfortune and long waits for a draw“Following Ally McCoist’s tongue-in-cheek claim that Kylian Mbappé scored ‘the first World Cup final hat-trick where all three crossed the line’, are there any other examples of footballing firsts or records whose holder is disputed or shrouded in controversy?” tweets Steve Hyde.A footnote in England’s World Cup defeat to France was that Harry Kane’s second penalty would have been his 54th goal for England, putting him one ahead of Wayne Rooney on the all-time list. But there is an argument that he should already be out on his own as England’s leading goalscorer.“Surely Coleen Rooney should be putting her considerable sleuthing skills to good use and examine whether her husband’s international scoring record should stand at 52 goals instead of 53?” writes Dylan Kenny. “His second goal v Switzerland in Euro 2004 is definitely an own goal.” Rooney’s second goal in that game came from a drive that hit the post before rebounding off the goalkeeper Jörg Stiel and into the net. A clear own-goal in 2023 but, as the dearly-missed Kevin McCarra wrote at the time, in 2004 there was a different attitude to such goals.What makes things even more interesting – to us, anyway – is that Kane was involved in a very similar goal against Lithuania in 2015. But by then the convention around such goals had changed, so it went down as an own-goal by the goalkeeper Giedrius Arlauskis. Had both Rooney’s and Kane’s been judged the same way, whether as goals or own-goals, Kane would be one ahead.And while we’re on the subject of generously awarded goals, Gary Lineker should probably have 47 for England rather than 48 – his second against the USA in 1985 should have been an own-goal by Dan Canter – and Marco van Basten probably didn’t score a hat-trick against England at Euro 1988. Slow down this video to 0.25x and you’ll see his first was almost certainly an own-goal by Gary Stevens of Everton.No, we’re not proud of ourselves.“As Lisandro Martínez won the World Cup with Argentina, four years after Raphaël Varane did so with France, when was the last time a team had a World Cup-winning centre-back partnership?” asks VP Pranav.You don’t have to go back too far for this one: from 2018-21, Varane and Sergio Ramos, who was champion of the world with Spain in 2010, were Real Madrid’s centre-back partnership (when fit). In fact, it’s not an uncommon occurrence. The Barcelona pair of Gerard Piqué and Carles Puyol also won the tournament with Spain in 2010 (though Ramos played at right-back), and Pique later spent some time playing alongside Samuel Umtiti, who was Varane’s partner in Russia in 2018.Jérôme Boateng and Mats Hummels (Bayern Munich/Germany 2014) also qualify, as do Frank Leboeuf and Marcel Desailly (Chelsea/France 1998) and Lucio and Marco Materazzi (Internazionale/Brazil 2002/Italy 2006).There are plenty more, but it’s probably in nobody’s best interest that we list them all, so we’ll end with a slightly more offbeat example. Andrea Barzagli and Cristian Zaccardo both played in the Italy team that won the World Cup in 2006, and spent the next couple of years bolting the back door for Palermo.“I recently played my testimonial for my local team before I moved abroad. During the match I had the horrible misfortune of breaking my leg. This got me wondering: has there ever been a case of a professional footballer getting a serious injury during their testimonial?” writes Andrew Wilson.Ouch. Testimonials are usually one rung down from friendlies on the ladder of intensity, so injuries are rare. But that wasn’t the case in a pre-season testimonial at Old Trafford in 2000. “Denis Irwin’s in August 2000 was a pugnacious affair as Manchester United took on their then-plucky rivals Manchester City,” recalls Colm McAuliffe. “While Phil Neville was taken off with a head wound, Irwin himself lasted just 37 minutes having soldiered on after a ferocious tackle by the current president of Liberia, George Weah … which occurred in the fourth minute. Irwin was out of action for a month.”There are a couple of other games worth mentioning. Paul McGrath injured his right ankle during his testimonial in 1998, when he tripped over the ball and allowed Dean Saunders to score the winning goal. McGrath was able to play on for the last few minutes. Twenty years earlier, Johan Cruyff suffered severely wounded pride during his farewell match at Ajax, when Bayern Munich left their goodwill at the airport and decided to run riot. They won 8-0.Bernard Carthy tweets: “This year could see three teams (Manchester United, Newcastle and Arsenal) finish in the top four, who didn’t finish there last season. Would this be the biggest change in top-four history?”Andy Brook has kindly done the work on this one, and writes: “The last time it happened was between 1992 (Leeds, Manchester United, Sheffield Wednesday, Arsenal) and 1993 (Manchester United, Aston Villa, Norwich, Blackburn). The last time the entire four changed seems to be way back in 1912-13: Blackburn, Everton, Newcastle, Bolton; then Sunderland, Villa, Wednesday, Manchester United.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“Tottenham have currently played 30 consecutive Premier League games without drawing one,” noted Wouter van Dael in 2019. “What is the longest ever such league run?”First, a bit of housekeeping. Spurs’ run eventually ended at 32 games – four at the back end of 2017-18, 28 at the start of 2018-19. A few of you asked the same question this week, as Blackburn are on a run of 31 Championship games without a draw: five last season, 26 in 2022-23. But they are still well short of the record, as we discovered in 2019 …The short answer is that Spurs are Premier League record-breakers, Wouter … but only just. “Bolton previously held this title with a run of 28 games between March and December 2011,” wrote James Clarke. “But in the wider context of English league history, Spurs have a long way to go yet. Twenty-nine clubs have had longer streaks without a draw at some point – and seven have gone more than 40 consecutive league games without a stalemate: Birmingham (43 games), Walsall (44), Leicester (44), Bradford Park Avenue (44), Stoke (46), Sunderland (46) and Aston Villa (51). Although it is probably worth noting that Sunderland’s is the most recent of these, coming comparatively recently in 1908-09. The slightly interesting quirk here is that five of these seven draw-less clubs are Midlands teams.“Aston Villa’s epic 51-game run spanned three seasons, and is rather nice since it started on New Year’s Day in 1891, with a 5-0 win over Everton. Villa then went the whole of 1891 without a league draw, and almost made it through 1892 as well – until Bolton ended the streak with a 1-1 draw on Christmas Eve.”“Who was the first American to play for a major European team?” asks Kurt Perleberg.Ruel Fox played his final club match on 21/4/2002, with his next match being an international match for Montserrat on 31/10/2004.
