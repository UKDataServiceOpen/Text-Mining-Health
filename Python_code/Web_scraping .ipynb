      "BLOCK: For the past three years, the patience of one billion people in China has been stretched, growing thinner and thinner with every lockdown and round of mass Covid testing. \n",
      "BLOCK: Now, that patience has snapped. \n",
      "BLOCK: As thousands took to the streets in cities protesting against Covid restrictions, an exhausted nation has been asking how much longer must they endure Xi Jinping's zero-Covid policy.\n",
      "BLOCK: In one of President Xi's biggest political tests yet, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) must now negotiate both mounting fury and a deep-rooted fear of Covid, as the country feels its way to an exit from the pandemic.\n",
      "BLOCK: An apartment fire in the western city of Urumqi may at first appear to be an unlikely spark for nationwide protests.\n",
      "BLOCK: But the deadly incident, which claimed the lives of 10 people, was the ultimate nightmare scenario for millions of urban Chinese who live in high-rise apartments: trapped in one's flat, unable to escape a roaring blaze because of a strictly enforced lockdown.\n",
      "BLOCK: Authorities disputed this, but it did not stop public outrage and anxiety from spreading, especially after videos and audio clips purportedly featuring residents screaming and begging to be released circulated online.\n",
      "BLOCK: The incident was also the latest in a series of horror stories linked to Covid restrictions. \n",
      "BLOCK: Early on, during city-wide lockdowns, reports surfaced of pregnant women losing their babies and the old and vulnerable dying, because of a lack of timely access to medical care. \n",
      "BLOCK: Many lockdowns also seemed to have the same stories of food and medicine shortages, as it became clear that local authorities were struggling to cope.\n",
      "BLOCK: Then, more traumatic incidents began to emerge, such as a  bus crash that killed dozens of people who were being ferried to quarantine centres, or children dying in quarantine facilities.\n",
      "BLOCK: Many hoped there would be a reprieve announced at the recent CCP congress where Mr Xi cemented his power, but he made it clear there would be no change to zero Covid, provoking more dismay.\n",
      "BLOCK: The policy has no doubt saved many lives, with China achieving one of the lowest per capita Covid death rates in the world. But it has also sapped the energy of its people. \n",
      "BLOCK: Suffering under Covid restrictions has become a unifying experience, breeding anger in many corners of China from major cities to far-flung regions like Xinjiang and Tibet. \n",
      "BLOCK: It has galvanised every part of society including university students, factory workers, middle-class families, and the elite.\n",
      "BLOCK: When a man staged a protest on a Beijing bridge, shocking the country with its openly defiant criticism of President Xi, it set the bar for the expression of more direct and sharper dissent both outside and within China, emboldening many others.\n",
      "BLOCK: In the central city of Zhengzhou, hundreds of factory workers called for their rights and scuffled with police, as they smashed surveillance cameras and windows. In Chongqing in the south-west, a maskless man was filmed shouting \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\" - a rallying cry picked up by many protesters.\n",
      "BLOCK: By the time the Urumqi fire happened, the stage was set for widespread demonstrations. Hundreds first took to the streets in that city, then many more followed suit in Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, Nanjing and Chengdu, some even calling for Mr Xi and the CCP to step down. \n",
      "BLOCK: This was previously unthinkable in a country that heavily punishes and censors anyone critical of the party and its leaders.\n",
      "BLOCK: Observers say the protests are a tipping point in Covid dissent, complicating a situation that is already difficult for the government.\n",
      "BLOCK: Ho-fung Hung, a sociologist with Johns Hopkins University, said they presented \"a dire situation\" and the first serious test to Mr Xi's rule.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"Over the last two years Mr Xi backed himself into a corner by owning the zero-Covid policy. The most rational way for him to handle the situation if protests continue to grow is to pressure local authorities to crack down hard while distancing himself.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"But then there is a risk that local authorities might refuse to follow the directive closely as they are worn down by the zero-Covid rigidities too.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: So could the government listen to the protesters, and unwind zero Covid?\n",
      "BLOCK: To do that now - while minimising deaths and infections - would be difficult, due to the country's low vaccination rates among the elderly, a lack of highly effective domestic vaccines, and the government's continued refusal to follow the rest of the world in using foreign vaccines. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"There's a dilemma for the government,\" Oxford University professor of modern Chinese history Rana Mitter told the BBC - do they import foreign vaccines \"which may look embarrassing in nationalistic terms or do they try to hold the line by keeping the borders closed without any end date for this policy?\"\n",
      "BLOCK: China recently appeared to test the waters by loosening measures slightly, where they reduced some quarantine periods and stopped recording secondary contacts.\n",
      "BLOCK: But, as seen in other countries such as Singapore and Australia which transitioned from zero Covid to living with the virus, any relaxation of measures would inevitably result in a jump in infections and deaths. \n",
      "BLOCK: This is an outcome which Chinese authorities still appear unwilling to accept.\n",
      "BLOCK: Many cities including Beijing and Guangzhou have once again put in place restrictions to tackle fresh outbreaks, even though experts have warned it is difficult to maintain zero Covid for the long term given the virus' rapid evolution and government's finite resources.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"Even if the government wants to change course now, it still has to address the rapid surge of cases nationwide. The problem is that it no longer has adequate state capacity or public support to contain the spread of the virus,\" said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n",
      "BLOCK: Part of the problem is the fear among officials that Covid deaths will spiral out of control and cause social unrest.\n",
      "BLOCK: But there is also the lingering fear of Covid among the Chinese - after three years of being conditioned by the state to view the virus as a fearsome enemy - as well as a continued lack of effective vaccines.\n",
      "BLOCK: In recent weeks, rumours spread in the city of Shijiazhuang and the Foxconn factory complex in Zhengzhou that residents would be used as \"guinea pigs\" to see what would happen if Covid was allowed to spread unchecked. \n",
      "BLOCK: In both places this prompted widespread panic and even led Zhengzhou workers to stage a mass breakout.\n",
      "BLOCK: For some, this fear has now been replaced by anger. In recent demonstrations, protesters have gathered in huge, dense crowds with some defiantly taking off their masks, as they call for freedom and restrictions to end.\n",
      "BLOCK: When and how that will happen exactly still remains unclear. \n",
      "BLOCK: Mr Xi and the Chinese Communist Party have created a Covid Gordian knot - one that is now extremely difficult to cut.\n",

      "HEADING How flexibility made managers miserable\n",
      "BLOCK: VVlada Randjelovic says his life at a Belgrade-based IT company became much harder when the firm introduced hybrid working. Randjelovic managed a sales team of 10 employees, half of whom chose to work in the office, while the other half worked from home. “I ended up having two worlds: one that existed in the office, the other remote,” he explains, “and they would only ever connect over Zoom meetings. I had to suddenly manage two separate teams doing the same work.” \n",
      "As he implemented the day-to-day running of the new working model, Randjelovic had to address issues as they arose, both from those above him and those reporting to him. “The hardest aspect of middle management is that everything has to go through you,” he says. “Top management would bring issues to middle management in coming up with a flexible solution. Hybrid was chosen, but it was much easier to say than to do; it came down to middle managers to solve challenges on a daily basis.” \n",
      "Part of the problem, he says, was that employee expectations became radically different. “People fundamentally changed following the pandemic. Employees wanted more in terms of salary, flexibility and freedom to work how they want. They became more stressed and sensitive to company changes.” \n",
      "Plus, he says, leading hybrid teams through a fundamental shift in how, when and where employees did their jobs proved to be a tremendous challenge. “You had a style of communication that needed to change overnight as people worked flexibly,” he says. “You had to re-think recruiting processes: hiring a worker that you might never meet in person. You had to accept that a fully remote team would naturally build its own workplace culture. Alongside that, everything sped up and intensified: you had less time to learn or make mistakes. It became a recipe for stress, overwork and burnout.” \n",
      "Many managers are indeed struggling in the new work world. In an October 2022 survey of 10,766 knowledge workers by US think-tank Future Forum, executives reported 40% more work-related stress and anxiety, 20% worse work-life balance and 15% less job satisfaction in the past year. This trend was particularly pronounced among middle managers, with those at large organisations showing the lowest scores for work-life balance, alongside the highest levels of stress and anxiety. \n",
      "These figures suggest that many bosses are having a hard time dealing with shifting employee expectations and working patterns. While employees have overwhelmingly relished greater autonomy over workdays and working models, managers have struggled to adapt as they lead teams through an unprecedented workplace transition.\n",
      "BLOCK: ‘Stuck in the middle’ \n",
      "Within an organisation, middle managers typically sit between an organisation’s executives and its employees. Even before the pandemic, this could be a difficult position to be in: they historically rank among the least happy in the workforce. \n",
      "“The name gives it away: middle managers are caught in the middle, they have to deal with issues up and down an organisation,” says Denise Rousseau, professor of organisational behaviour and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, based in Pittsburgh, US. “It’s traditionally been a hard role – they have to act upon conflicting feedback that comes from employees and senior leaders.” \n",
      "When the pandemic hit, middle managers’ jobs became harder: they not only had to deal with the emotional impact on their teams – they also had to find ways of enabling remote work virtually overnight. “The processes in which people had communicated, coordinated and shared information in the workplace for decades were suddenly overhauled, and left for managers to figure out,” says Rousseau. \n",
      "As the pandemic has waned, middle managers have faced ongoing pressures as workplaces pivot their operations. It’s these leaders who executives ask to implement unpopular return-to-office mandates or hybrid-working policies. In many cases, managers are caught between two sides pulling in opposite directions: while many workers want to hold on to their autonomous set-ups, some bosses have pushed for an office return. “They can end up caught in the middle, having to balance the uncertainty of what executives say about their working models against the clamour among employees for flexible working,” says Helen Kupp, senior director at Future Forum, based in California. \n",
      "Middle managers can also find they struggle to lead flexible teams, says Rousseau; the methods they used before are no longer available to them. “Flexible working requires a shift in the behaviours, processes and systems that enable managers to build connections, assess work and monitor the circumstances of staff,” she adds. “But the ways in which managers have been trained to offer support and evaluate work require them to have eyes on the person and the information being right in front of them.” \n",
      "Compared to in-office settings, engaging and leading teams through a screen can be much harder, says Rousseau. “Managing often requires thinking about how the other person is thinking – it’s predicated on assumptions made of that person having worked with them before. But that needs updating amid flexible working, and a culture of trust. And trust takes longer to build among distributed teams in which colleagues never meet in person.” \n",
      "All this means that much more is being demanded of middle managers now than before the pandemic. “A manager before Covid-19 compared to today is completely different,” says Randjelovic.\n",
      "BLOCK: Why they’re struggling to cope \n",
      "Many middle managers may be unprepared for the new challenges they’re facing. Although managers are in theory promoted based on their leadership strengths, many are actually thrust into senior positions as a reward for perceived company loyalty or day-to-day job skills. \n",
      "“In reality, managers are often in their role because of hard skills,” says Kupp. “But to be a good manager, especially with flexible working, requires a focus on softer skills: building connections, culture and belonging among distributed teams.” \n",
      "Right now, some managers are experiencing a crash course in soft skills, while also having to tackle their daily workloads. “Hybrid working challenges you on a personal level as a worker, and then also on a managerial level,” says Randjelovic. “You need to update your company culture, have online routines set up for your team, and place your trust in them on a completely new level.” \n",
      "Plus, while executives continue to fine-tune their hybrid set-ups, middle managers may find themselves without much-needed organisational support in place. “Managers were often under-supported in their role even before the pandemic,” says Kupp. “Flexible working has deepened the issues that make the transition to management difficult: it requires more help, training and the redefining of what it means to be a successful manager.” \n",
      "Forced to deal with evolving policies and norms, often without organisational help, it’s no wonder many managers are feeling stressed and unhappy. “They should be the lynchpins in making flexible work successful, but they’re instead stuck in a tug-of-war between what executives and employees want from flexible working,” says Kupp.\n",
      "BLOCK: Teuila Hanson, chief people officer at LinkedIn, based in San Francisco, says that managers who find themselves in firms still clinging on to presenteeism are more likely to struggle leading hybrid teams. “When the job is more about monitoring who’s going into the office or not, rather than conversations around trust, that becomes harder for managers.” \n",
      "The longer-term picture  \n",
      "While difficulties managing distributed and remote teams remain, remote and hybrid working aren’t going away. This means companies will need to find a way to help miserable or stressed middle managers. \n",
      "Hanson believes that managers will need fresh training if they’re to thrive leading flexible teams. “There previously weren’t many courses on managing hybrid teams: knowing which conversations to have in terms of working in person, or knowing how to manage someone you’ll never meet in real life. It’s not easy: if you’re a manager today compared to 2019, absolutely your job is more challenging.” \n",
      "Kupp predicts, however, that the tug-of-war between employers and employees over flexibility will gradually ease, potentially lightening the load on middle managers. Market demand means flexible working will be here to stay, she says, so employers will ultimately have to cede ground. “We know that employees want flexibility and that they’re willing to walk if their current job doesn’t provide it. So, what we’re currently seeing are likely short-term growth pains.”  \n",
      "Randjelovic, meanwhile, believes that managing flexible teams will become more enjoyable once formal systems are more widely adopted. “When the pandemic first hit, and everything turned online, managers believed that company culture and processes didn't need to change – we just needed online alternatives for everything. I think it’s only now that businesses have accepted they need to adapt, rather than find quick fixes.” \n",
      "He now works as a business consultant for an HR firm, after leaving management for a fresh challenge. He hasn’t ruled out managing again in the future, however; for all its challenges, leading a hybrid team through the pandemic gave him skills he’s been able to take forward. “Being a middle manager means being the middleman: everyone's problems become yours,” he says. “But it’s not a challenge to run away from – I’ve personally made big improvements in my online and in-person communication.”\n",

      "HEADING Saint Malo: The first Asian settlement in the US\n",
      "BLOCK: JJust five miles downriver from the ornate, iron-lace balconies of New Orleans' French Quarter, bright stucco buildings and raucous bars give way to a more serene landscape stroked in wild marsh grasses and thick mud. Fishermen sell fresh shrimp along the roads that cut through St Bernard Parish as their boats bob in the bayous nearby. The quiet, 200-year-old suburb is famous for its fishing industry and unique geography, appearing to rise up on a map from Louisiana's eastern coast like a cresting wave before spitting dozens of islands and marshes into the Gulf of Mexico.\n",
      "Here, on Lake Borgne, where laughing gulls dive for speckled trout and sudden squalls regularly batter boats, is where Saint Malo once stood, the first permanent Filipino settlement in the United States and the country's oldest-known permanent Asian settlement.\n",
      "The story of Louisiana's rich and diverse bayous is often told through the melding and mixing of Spanish colonisers, French Acadians, Native Americans and both enslaved Africans and free people of colour. But throughout history, there has been one largely forgotten ingredient missing from this rich cultural stew: before the US was a country, Filipinos were likely living in raised stilt bahay kubo-like homes built over the swampland outside New Orleans.\n",
      "BLOCK: From these \"floating villages\" they established the community's fishing industry and introduced Louisiana to dried shrimp – produced by boiling, brining and sun-drying the crustaceans to preserve and concentrate their flavour. Dried shrimp were an important commodity in the days before refrigeration, and today, many locals still eat them as a snack or use them as an umami-rich ingredient to flavour stocks, sauces and gumbos.\n",
      "Alongside later Chinese immigrants, these so-called \"Manilamen\" transported dried shrimp all over the world. According to Laine Kaplan Levenson, a host of the Southern Foodways Alliance's Gravy podcast, by the 1870s, the swamps of Louisiana hosted more than 100 shrimp-drying platforms, each more than three football fields long. \"In effect, dried shrimp globalised Louisiana's seafood industry\" and laid the foundation for Louisiana's modern-day shrimp industry, she notes on the podcast episode.\n",
      "But how these Manilamen arrived in Louisiana is a mystery as murky as the bayou itself. Some historians believe they came on Spanish trade vessels in the mid-1700s. Others believe Filipino sailors and servants plying the Manila-Acapulco trade route jumped ship in the New World and sought refuge in the Gulf, whose marshy, flood-prone landscape resembled their homeland. Some British colonists even talked of \"Malay pirates\" that were part of French pirate Jean Lafitte's band of smugglers who captured Spanish galleons.\n",
      "One of the oldest-known accounts of Saint Malo comes from an 1883 article in Harper's Weekly, when the writer Lafcadio Hearn painted a dream-like picture of the \"floating\" community: \"Out of the shuddering reeds and banneretted grass… rise the fantastic houses of the Malay fishermen, posed upon slender supports above the marsh, like cranes or bitterns watching for scaly prey.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Hearn noted that the community had existed for roughly 50 years before his visit, but in a story for History.com, Filipino American historian Kirby Aráullo wrote that, \"according to oral traditions, there was already an existing Filipino community there by 1763 when both the Philippines and Louisiana were under the Spanish colonial government in Mexico\".\n",
      "According to Randy Gonzales, a fourth-generation Filipino Louisianan, historian and professor of English at the University of Lafayette, the Manilamen saw opportunity in the Louisiana Gulf, an area that many people found too wild and hostile. Though mosquitoes often swarmed and hurricanes battered it, the Manilamen were used to typhoons in the Philippines. Like the Philippines, St Bernard Parish was ruled by Spain; Spanish was the primary language in the area, and the Manilamen shared Spanish heritage with many residents. It also wasn't very populated, offering economic opportunities for those who knew how to harness its wild spirit.\n",
      "The Filipino settlers already knew how to make nets and catch shrimp from life in the Philippines, explained Liz Williams, founder of the Southern Food and Beverage Museum in New Orleans. But it was in the swampy marshes of St Bernard that they pioneered a method for preserving and drying the crustaceans. According to Williams, after boiling the shrimp in brine, the Filipino settlers laid them out on platforms and dried them for several days. Then, they shuffled over the shrimp to remove the shells.\n",
      "\"[They would] put some kind of canvas or other fabric over their feet, and they would walk on nets that were up above the water in the marshy area and walk on the dried shrimp,\" she said. The shrimp shells crumbled off, but the dried shrimp, made tough by the salt from the brine, didn't break. The shells fell back into the marsh, while the shrimp stayed on the net. They called this the \"shrimp dance\".\n",
      "BLOCK: \"They realised that [dried shrimp] could be shipped out and go all over the world because we have so many shrimp and so many shrimp seasons here,\" Williams added. \"You have river shrimp, you have white shrimp, you have brown shrimp, and they don't all run at the same time.\"\n",
      "John Folse, a chef, restaurant owner and expert on Cajun and Creole cuisine, remembers there always being a bucket of dried shrimp on his childhood home's back porch in Louisiana's St James Parish during the 1950s. Like many Cajun families, his family ate what they harvested, hunted or preserved themselves. And like the Filipino settlers, Folse's grandfathers also sun-dried the shrimp. They caught them, threw salt over them and spread them on a table outside during the day and covered them at night. \"You see, [dried shrimp] was almost like a gift that just kept on giving through the season when everything else was out,\" he said. \"We could always count on the fact that we had preserved that particular ingredient.\"\n",
      "\"With bland vegetables like eggplants and squashes from our gardens, the dried shrimp were perfect for bringing that explosive flavour that we just couldn't get out of putting crab meat or regular shrimp into it,\" Folse added. \"Smoked sausages like smoked andouille were really, really expensive, and dried shrimp were available to us all the time. So, when I think of it, I think, 'My god, what in the heck would we have done without it?'\"\n",
      "To visitors today, dried shrimp is most visible hanging in little bags in the check-out lines of the local grocery stores. These bags bear names like Blum & Bergeron – typical Louisiana surnames that show just how ingrained the product is in the state's culinary landscape. In fact, it's unlikely that many locals recognise the food's early Filipino origins, and that's because the history of Saint Malo itself has largely been forgotten.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"These stories get lost over time,\" Gonzales said. \"In the 20th Century, the reason these stories [got] lost is because of assimilation – and in some ways, because of segregation. Filipinos are brown. Well, when you're brown, you can be white or black, depending on who's deciding. And so, my grandmother had to go to school and say, 'Look, my son is white' so he wouldn't go to the black school, which wasn't funded as much. There were real pragmatic reasons to kind of let that identity slip.\"\n",
      "There are also physical reasons why the story of Saint Malo has been lost. According to Gonzalez, there are so few artefacts and records of the settlement that piecing together the Manilamen's history has proved difficult.\n",
      "Marina Estrella Espina, author of the book Filipinos in Louisiana, was one of the first modern historians to document the story of the Filipinos at Saint Malo. Between 1970 and 1990, she tracked down descendants of the Manilamen, and gathered family photos, birth certificates and stories, which she stored in her New Orleans home. But when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005, her home took on 11ft of water, literally washing away her research. \"Every 50 years, nature seems to diminish the Filipino history here,\" she said in a 2006 interview.\n",
      "The loss was devastating. According to a spokesman for the Filipino American Historical Society, \"Espina's research was the foundation of Filipino American history.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: \"We've lost so much through storms,\" Gonzales said. In fact, much of the actual land near the Saint Malo settlement is slipping away. St Bernard Parish is famous for its vanishing coastline, and could lose more than 70% of its land area over the next 50 years without intervention. As the remains of the land that hosted the Manilamen slowly disappear into the Gulf of Mexico, it seems like a dark metaphor for the history of the site itself.\n",
      "Still, the story of these Filipino settlers is finally being recognised. Gonzales, a prominent researcher on the history of Filipinos in the US, authored the book Settling St. Malo: Poems from Filipino Louisiana, and has written many essays exploring the topic. In 2019, the Philippine-Louisiana Historical Society erected a marker to commemorate Saint Malo's history, and Gonzales wrote the text for the plaque. In 2012, the group erected another historical marker roughly 45 miles south in Barataria Bay to commemorate Manila Village, a later Filipino shrimp-drying village that lasted from the turn of the 19th Century until 1965 when Hurricane Betsy destroyed it.\n",
      "The Saint Malo marker is located at the nearby Los Isleños Museum Complex, just a few miles from where the village would have stood, now a popular fishing spot devoid of any of the settlement's early stilted structures. The Manilamen's story is also highlighted in a new exhibit examining the role of Filipinos in Louisiana history at the SoFAB Research Center at Nunez College in St Bernard.\n",
      "So much of the Manilamen's story has vanished, either because of storms or assimilation. But as Gonzales said, exploring it reminds people that \"Filipinos were a part of it, and we are still here [in Louisiana]. I'm telling the Filipino story to talk about a story that's been kind of lost – and [as a warning] that all of our stories can be lost in this way.\"\n",

      "HEADING Weinstein drama She Said and the films taking on abusive men\n",
      "BLOCK: IIt’s been five years since the flames of the #MeToo reckoning were fanned by the New York Times exposé of disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein for sexual assault, so it was inevitable that Hollywood would commit this story to its own cinematic record. She Said, directed by Maria Schrader and written by Rebecca Lenkiewicz, is a powerful adaptation of She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement, the 2019 book by Times journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey that recounts how they broke the explosive story, with Zoe Kazan and Carey Mulligan playing the intrepid reporters.\n",
      "Since its premiere at the 60th New York Film Festival in October, the drama has been praised for its precise approach to journalistic storytelling, which is reminiscent of 2016 Oscar-winner Spotlight: rather than sensationalising the efforts of Kantor and Twohey or the testimonies of the survivors who spoke out against Weinstein, it provides the grounded, granular detail of what goes into such a difficult investigation, without undercutting the emotional ordeal for the women involved.\n",
      "More like this: – 10 of the best films to watch this November– The horror that demonised older women – How female rage became a force in film and TV\n",
      "Rowena Chiu was one of those \"unfamous women trying to do their jobs who were abused by Harvey\", as she alleged in her own New York Times op-ed. She was hired to assist the Miramax producer in London on his European productions, and says that Weinstein attempted to rape her at the Venice Film Festival only two months after starting the job – at which point her own manager, Zelda Perkins, confronted Weinstein. Chiu says she was eventually coerced by Weinstein into signing a non-disclosure agreement in return for a £125,000 settlement.\n",
      "BLOCK: Chiu's traumatic experiences are depicted in the film – and as Chiu tells BBC Culture, she had to make a big decision about whether she wanted to feature in the movie before she had even gone public with her story; her allegations had appeared in the original reporting in 2017, but at that point, she had chosen to remain anonymous. Kantor and Twohey's book did end up naming her, but nine months before it was published, when she had not yet agreed to have her name published, she recalls attending \"a very clandestine meeting\", where she joined fellow Weinstein survivor Laura Madden and Perkins for a \"surreal\" conversation in a Hollywood office \"to discuss the hypothetical movie\" as well. \"Because the article was already out, and had made such an impact on the world, publishers were excited in advance of Jodi and Megan's book, and film rights were almost sold before the book was written – that's rare, I think, to have things happen in that order.\"\n",
      "Chiu was reticent about explicitly featuring in both the book and film in the first instance because of how her story might be portrayed. \"Authors and journalists and podcast hosts, everyone else that would want to have a piece of it, are mediators who have their own agenda of selling books or selling papers, or reaching an audience,\" she says. \"However benevolent and benign that motive might be, that is never going to quite align with the survivors' motivations. Often, survivor stories aren't particularly palatable for audiences, perhaps because they are too raw,\" she adds.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"They're difficult, they're confronting and because Hollywood creates fictional accounts of real-life events, it can be challenging for the survivor to see his or her real story be fictionalised in that way. The emotional impact is so powerful that audiences start to react to the fictionalised account in a greater way than they do to your real-life account.\"\n",
      "However when Chiu saw She Said at the London premiere, she recognised the real value of the film in the reaction of her best friend, who she had told in 1998 about her attack and attended with her. \"Even though he knew all the events that had happened to me throughout the years, including my [subsequent] suicide attempts in Hong Kong – he was actually a person that I called [in the scene you see in the] the hotel room, where Ashley Chiu is portraying my suicidal self – I saw him cry at the movie and relate to it in an emotional way that he might not have when I was testifying to Parliament or going on BBC Newsnight,\" she says. \"In that moment I felt proud that the movie is going to reach places in people's hearts that all the other accounts don't.\"\n",
      "Different styles of interrogation\n",
      "She Said is not the only narrative film in recent years to engage with the culture of systemic male abuse that has been exposed in the five years since the first Weinstein revelations. 2019's Bombshell (written and directed by two men: Charles Randolph and Jay Roach, respectively) takes a more buzzy approach to telling the story of the efforts made by a group of female Fox News journalists to expose the alleged toxic workplace behaviour and sexual harassment of Fox News head Roger Ailes (a story that broke before Weinstein). TV drama The Loudest Voice also dealt with Ailes's alleged misconduct, this time centring Russell Crowe as Ailes in the story over his victims. Meanwhile series as varied as The Morning Show, BoJack Horseman, Jane the Virgin and Grey’s Anatomy have interrogated systemic abuses and harassment towards women in the workplace, as perpetrated by powerful men, from a breakfast show host and a sitcom actor to a university professor and a doctor.\n",
      "Then there was 2020's Promising Young Woman, which interrogated the behaviour of men as a group: the feature debut of Emerald Fennell, it starred Mulligan as an avenging angel giving payback to the male species for the rape and suicide of her best friend, and was a poppy yet darkly humorous comment on the normalised habits of so-called \"nice guys\" preying on drunk women. The film certainly sparked a conversation. Focus Features partnered with RAINN, the US's largest anti-sexual violence organisation, to stream the film in colleges and its worldwide release launched a thousand think-pieces on the various merits and mistakes in Fennell's take on rape culture, trauma and the societal propensity for protecting predators. Like Bombshell, it earned significant awards season notice and was nominated for best picture, best director, best actress (Mulligan), and best film editing at the 2021 Academy Awards, winning for best original screenplay.\n",
      "BLOCK: There is one film, however, that deserves more recognition than it ever officially received for its striking approach to the painful subject matter: Kitty Green's The Assistant, which showed a day in the life of Jane, the eponymous female employee of a Weinstein-like producer, played by Julia Garner. For Nikki Baughan, deputy reviews editor for Screen International, it was a film all the stronger because of its understatement. \"It is so powerful because we never see this man, we only hear his voice through a door, on a phone, but we completely understand his hideous behaviour, and the insidious effect it has on those around him, by Jane's reactions.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"She gets physically smaller in the frame as the film goes on, increasingly quiet and downcast, isolated in this toxic environment in which she has zero autonomy,\" she adds. \"It's a film that says so much about toxic masculinity, gender abuse and the trauma of speaking out, without ever feeling the need to soapbox or lecture. It makes you feel like you're walking in Jane's shoes.\"\n",
      "Winnie M Li, film producer-turned-author, sexual assault survivor and activist, similarly praises The Assistant because she felt it \"nailed\" what other #MeToo films dealing with abuse in the the entertainment industry struggled with. \"The thing with trying to represent #MeToo in the film industry is, like, how do you make it not too on the nose?\" says Li, whose recent novel Complicit has earned acclaim for its depiction of power imbalances and cover-ups in the film world through the recollections of a former female producer for an indie film company.\n",
      "\"Bombshell was too on the nose and glossy. The reason [The Assistant] worked is because it was such a narrow perspective and, in some ways, was marginal to what was happening – but that was the point in terms of the impact that all of that had on her as a young woman working in the industry. She was abused by a boss who was yelling at her but she wasn't sexually abused, she kind of witnessed it – I think that was quite a powerful glimpse of the reality and the mundanity of being an assistant.\"\n",
      "As much as She Said positions Kantor and Twohey as the protagonists of this film, it dedicates significant screen time to the experiences of Perkins, Madden and Chiu through flashbacks to their time working with Weinstein in the 1990s, and scenes of them providing their testimonies in 2017, when they are played by Samantha Morton, Jennifer Ehle and Angela Yeoh respectively. Yeoh, who was a journalist herself before breaking into acting, consulted with Chiu in preparing for the role. \"I'm used to reaching out to people and asking if they'll speak to me, and I was lucky to be able to get hold of Rowena,\" says Yeoh. \"As a storyteller, [and] as someone who's experienced abuse, I was curious about how to shine a light on the subject, because I feel it's still deeply misunderstood.\n",
      "\"How do you choose those words? Without pretending that it can encapsulate the whole experience, within the legal and creative constraints of the film, [I wanted] those words and whatever I conveyed as an actor to be as truthful as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "BLOCK: She Said is a film that demands you actively listen to the words, conversations and testimonies of female survivors. It's also about the power of women confiding in each other instead of staying silent, which is the subject of another film that has been making waves this autumn, Sarah Polley's Women Talking. Based on the 2018 novel of the same name by Canadian writer Miriam Toews, and set in 2010, the film centres on a closed-off, fictional colony of the Protestant Mennonite sect, where a group of women must grapple with their faith and the reality that their menfolk have been drugging and raping them for years. Rage, fury, frustration, sorrow, humour, solidarity and empathy lace the varying perspectives of characters played by Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley, Rooney Mara and Judith Ivey, who are tasked with debating and deciding what they must do to live in a community without fear. Polley, like Schrader, never shows us the violent assaults – purposely keeping the abusers in the periphery so there is never any doubt about the importance of women being at the centre of their own stories of survival.\n",
      "BLOCK: These films have another thing in common; both are produced by Plan B, the production company set up by Brad Pitt, who has a history with Weinstein. In 2019, he recounted to CNN how he had confronted the producer in 1995 after learning of his alleged harrassment of his then-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow – something originally revealed by Paltrow to the New York Times in the first 2017 exposé. Someone close to Pitt tells BBC Culture that he was the only person to stand up to Weinstein about his behaviour towards women at the time; he subsequently did not work on a Miramax production again. However the actor would then go on to star in the Weinstein-distributed Inglourious Basterds and, his ex-wife Angelina Jolie alleges, sought Weinstein out to be a producer on his 2012 film Killing Them Softly, although this did not come to pass and The Weinstein Company later distributed it only. Jolie claims she protested Pitt working with Weinstein because, she alleges, the movie mogul assaulted her in 1998 while making Playing by Heart. \"I was asked to do The Aviator, but I said no because [Weinstein] was involved,” the actress told the Guardian in 2021. “I never associated or worked with him again. It was hard for me when Brad did…We fought about it. Of course it hurt.\" But another source disputes that Pitt approached Weinstein to be a producer for Killing Them Softly and says that the film was sold by CAA sale agents to The Weinstein Company without Pitt interacting with Weinstein about it.\n",
      "Pitt’s producing credit has been a point of conversation around She Said and Women Talking, feeding into wider questions of whether there is hypocrisy in films about abuse being made in the very Hollywood system that legitimised Weinstein, but Chiu says she would rather not dwell on this discussion. \"Being involved in the #MeToo movement is a very complex and triggering thing in itself so I've tried to focus on the positive aspects. Even though I've given up my privacy, and it’s difficult to talk about traumatic things in public in this way, it is helping other women. So when it comes to the movie, I think about Dede Gardner [Plan B president and producer], Maria, Rebecca, Carey and Zoe, and all these other amazing female contributors, including Angela and Ashley. It's a real testament to women pulling together and making incredible art in support of a movement which itself was about women pulling together.\"\n",
      "The stories that are missing\n",
      "Yet, while there have been many more fictionalised accounts of sexual harassment and abuse of power in the past five years, most of them have focused predominantly on white women. This is the case with She Said, Women Talking and another big autumn movie Tár, starring Cate Blanchett, which centres on a celebrated conductor-composer who displays predatory behaviour towards young female musicians. \"So many of the representations of #MeToo narratives in the entertainment industry still feature primarily young, white (and of course, attractive) female protagonists,\" says Li, whose lead character in Complicit is a Chinese-American woman and who is Taiwanese-American herself. \"We know women of colour are just as likely – if not, more likely – to suffer from sexual harassment, discrimination and silencing at work. And yet we still don't see those realities being reflected on screen. Which is ironic, since #MeToo has contributed to a larger industry conversation about equality and inclusivity on both sides of the camera.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Michaela Coel's 2020 HBO/BBC series I May Destroy You – a semi-autobiographical account of a woman trying to solve the puzzle of her rape while navigating a publishing industry not designed for people of her race or class to feel supported – was a striking exception. Among other things, it provided complex representation of both a black female and queer experience of assault to which people from any background could viscerally relate. Li calls it the \"gold standard\" of these types of stories, where the victim doesn’t have to be perfect. \"Arabella makes all these bad decisions, which I've always felt is more representative of being in a traumatic state,\" the author says. \"If you've been through that kind of trauma, you're going to have that struggle to want to tell your own story on your own terms. I felt it was much more authentic.\"\n",
      "Documentaries like On the Record, Surviving R Kelly and Athlete A have shared the stories of black women abused in the entertainment industry and US gymnastics, but, when it comes to fictionalised feature films and TV shows, far more room could be made for intersectional stories of survival beyond the white norm in order to empower women of all backgrounds to speak up for themselves and others. \"The East Asia and Southeast Asian communities tend to be very hesitant to speak out about sexual assault so She Said bears a pretty heavy burden in terms of representing a diversity story in a movement that has largely centred on white narratives,\" says Chiu.\n",
      "\"There's still a lot more space to understand the complexity and nuance of power dynamics, abuse, how abuse can happen and what the experience of abuse is like, in all its diversity across the spectrum,\" adds Yeoh. \"Also, what the healing journey is to come out of that because everyone's different.\"\n",
      "Despite the Oscar buzz, She Said was released in the US and its opening box office did not light up – it grossed $2.25 million (£1.86 million) from 2,022 theatres. Its slow start could be simply a reminder that a lot of critical favourites fail to stimulate audience interest before award season. Or it might be a sign of fatigue over #MeToo storylines. Li certainly believes there is a backlash in terms of how people are reacting to the movement now. \"Some people are rolling their eyes but the irony is that the #MeToo fight, ultimately, is about gender inequality, and that's been going on for all of human history, since the beginning of the film industry, and only recently have big names been called out,\" she says.\n",
      "\"It's an incredibly short-sighted backlash for people who are, like, 'it's no longer hip and trendy to be doing #MeToo narratives,'\" says Li. \"Because it still speaks to a lived reality that many women and people of other gender experiences have to go through.\"\n",
      "The story didn't end when Kantor and Twohey clicked publish in 2017; rather, it had only just begun, and while the past five years have empowered women to speak up and speak out about the systemic patriarchal abuses we face, it's not always been easy, or welcomed. But cinema will continue to be a vital forum to confront and examine the myriad ways in which a post-#MeToo/Weinstein society succeeds or fails in protecting women. \"It's important that we keep having this conversation,\" says Baughan, \"[that] we keep the focus on victims of abuse and allow them to have a voice.\"\n",
      "She Said is out now in US and UK cinemas. Women Talking is released in US cinemas on 2 December and UK cinemas on 10 February 2023.\n",

      "HEADING The weird and wonderful art created when AI and humans unite\n",
      "BLOCK: IIn 2020, I was in a creative funk. The Covid-19 pandemic was transforming relationships, gatherings, and ways of working. Like many, I struggled to feel inspired when we were all physically isolated from one another. However, amid all the chaos and uncertainty I found an unexpected collaborator: an AI.\n",
      "At the time, I had access to a machine learning algorithm called GPT-3, which is capable of writing passages of original text. For instance, if you type in something like \"The following is a description of a fish:\", you might get back:\n",
      "A fish is a small, silver-coloured creature with a long, slender body. Its fins are delicate and transparent, and its tail is forked. Its eyes are large and black, and its mouth is small.\n",
      "It's not pulled from the internet – the AI writes itself. However, GPT-3 can do far more than a few sentences: with the right prompts, it can produce essays, fiction, and even articles like this one. Its writing often passes for human. I played with all manner of output: dad jokes, poems, sci-fi stories and more.\n",
      "BLOCK: After a couple of weeks of experimentation, I realised the AI had the potential to describe imaginary artworks. To my delight, I discovered I could prompt it to write the kind of text you see on a wall label next to a painting in an art gallery. This would prove to be the start of a fascinating collaborative journey with GPT-3 and a suite of other AI art tools, leading to work that has ranged from a physical sculpture of toilet plungers to full-size oil paintings on the wall of a Mayfair art gallery. \n",
      "In recent months, AI-generated art has provoked much debate about whether it will be bad news for artists. There's little doubt that there will be disruptive changes ahead, and there are still important questions about bias, ethics, ownership and representation that need to be answered. However, this would not be the first time that new technologies have caused upheaval in the art world – it's been happening for centuries. And in my own experience, working with AI to make sculptures, paintings and more has transformed how I think about the creative process and the possibilities of human-machine collaboration. I believe we're now seeing the emergence of a whole new artform.\n",

      "\n",
      "To be clear, when I refer to AI, it's not an anthropomorphic or sentient system, but a machine learning algorithm – and there needs to be a human in the process. I quickly learnt this in my early experiments with GPT-3, when I asked it to create imaginary artworks. While it was fairly easy to get the system to create descriptions that all sounded good, getting it to create output that I considered interesting was another thing altogether. I spent about a month on \"prompt engineering\", a term which means writing effective input text for AI systems. \n",
      "Once I found a sequence of initial words that would \"tickle\" the AI in the right way, I developed a workflow with GPT-3 and other algorithms that could produce a description of an artwork and the imagined human name of its creator, along with their birthdate and other details (which are sometimes gleaned by asking GPT-3 questions). I then sifted through hundreds to thousands of outputs to find ones that I like. Those were then fed back into the system to create more text. I then corrected for punctuation, spacing and other technical tweaks to the text (nothing that changes its meaning). \n",
      "I knew I had hit upon the right recipe when I got the following output (which made me laugh a little too hard alone in my studio in lockdown):\n",
      "The sculpture contains a plunger, a toilet plunger, a plunger, a plunger, a plunger, and a plunger, each of which has been modified. The first plunger is simply a normal plunger, but the rest represent a series of plungers with more and more of the handle removed until just the rubber cup is left. The title of the artwork is \"A Short History of Plungers and Other Things That Go Plunge in the Night\" by the artists known as \"The Plungers\" (whose identity remains unknown).\n",
      "\"The Plungers\", were a collective of anonymous artists, founded in 1972. They were dedicated to the \"conceptualization and promotion of a new art form called Plungism.\" Plungism was a creative interpretation of the idea of Plungerism, which was defined by The Plungers as \"a state of mind wherein the mind of an artist is in a state of flux and able to be influenced by all things, even plungers.\" The Plungers' works were displayed in New York galleries and included such titles as \"Plunger's Progress,\" \"The Plungers,\"  \"The Plungers Strike Back,\" and \"Big Plunger 4: The Final Plunger,\" all of which featured plungers, and \"Plungers on Parade,\" which showed images of plungers in public spaces. The Plungers disappeared and left no trace of their identity.\n",
      "This led me to wonder: what if I took these generative descriptions and made them in real life? As the AI can't make physical objects, it would be up to my human faculties to do so. Moving the work from the digital to the physical realm, I concluded, would add weight and presence to them, which is sometimes lacking on a screen. A kind of symbiosis formed, with the AI producing output that it then \"needed\" my imagination, fabrication ability, aesthetic judgment, and intuition to visualise and complete.\n",
      "Here's the physical manifestation of the plunger artwork, which I created as part of a series the AI has titled \"AI Am I?\":\n",
      "BLOCK: One could easily see this absurd sculpture comfortably parked next to Duchamp's urinal in a high-concept museum. Of course, \"The Plungers\" collective never existed, but this narrative creates a compelling story in this work of fictional realism. As with many contemporary artworks, the text is as important as the artwork itself, so I consider the final work diptychs, the artwork, and the wall label together.\n",
      "Other examples included the following sculptures, which the AI described in the captions above each image:\n",
      "The AI's description:\n",
      "This sculpture consists of a flip clock which is scrambled like a bad dream. It sits upon an empty can of stew that the artist ate because it was time for dinner, and she was hungry... (Read the full text).\n",
      "\n",
      "BLOCK: The AI's description:\n",
      "This sculpture is like a child's building toy made giant…The title of the work \"Permanent Temporary\" is derived from a remark by the artist's father, who, after observing the sculpture, said, \"Well, it's permanent in the sense that it won't blow away, but it's temporary because you can put it together and take it apart.\" (Read the full text).\n",
      "BLOCK: The AI's description:\n",

      "BLOCK: The AI's description:\n",
      "This sculptural work is made from shingles, grab bars, a porch light, and police issue handcuffs…The work is an exploration of the idea of home. It examines the boundaries and limitations of the domestic sphere, and the ways in which it can be a form of constriction…(Read the full text).\n",
      "BLOCK: One of the unexpected offshoots of working with GPT-3 was that it encouraged me to experiment with artistic mediums and techniques that I may have never tried on my own. It also prompted me to work with other artists to produce art in mediums in which I had no expertise or skillset.\n",
      "For example, graffiti has an aesthetic vocabulary and terminology that I am not an expert in. However, when I gave an AI description of a graffiti work to my friend who has been a graffiti artist for decades, he was able to render the artwork in a way that neither the AI nor I could. This added yet another human into the human-machine loop.\n",
      "The AI's description:\n",
      "The Sofa King's signature, a large \"Cool S\" followed by a K and a backwards \"7\" with a tail, is the most easily identifiable among his work… (Read the full text).\n",
      "BLOCK: Of course, the opposite might be true and you need the boundless imagination of a child, so I also enlisted the help of a five-year-old to render this artwork:\n",
      "The AI's description:\n",
      "This artwork was created by a 5 year old child. The image depicts a house, or maybe a boat, or maybe a house on a boat… (Read the full text).\n",
      "BLOCK: My experiments with AI didn't end there. In the last year, there's been an explosion in \"generative\" AI art. For some of these tools, such as Dall-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, you can simply write a prompt – a description of an image –  and the AI will draw it for you. For others, like Artbreeder Collage and Make-A-Scene, you make a rudimentary sketch or initial collage alongside the prompt, and it fleshes out the detail. Each platform varies in both its aesthetic output and its features.\n",
      "Below is an example of text-based artwork I made for Gen.art (which echoes our five year old nicely). I created it with the prompt \"Cotton Candy Dream Boat\":\n",
      "BLOCK: And this one is a floating hot dog I made with Make-A-Scene:\n",
      "BLOCK: After playing around with these tools for a while, I realised it was another opportunity to bring humans into the process. In this case, painting reproducers, curators and collectors.\n",
      "I tried many different prompts until I found interesting outputs, and then chose some of them (out of many that didn't make the cut) to send to reproduction artisans to be made into real oil paintings. You can watch them being painted here, and here's one from my recent show, \"I'm Not a Painter\" at the Gazelli Art House in London:\n",
      "The AI's description:\n",
      "This painting is a depiction of a couple having an argument while attempting to assemble IKEA furniture in their home…The artist states \"The painting is meant to be a metaphor for the way our lives are often controlled by consumer culture.\" (Read the full text).\n",
      "BLOCK: Here you can see how one of the oil paintings was presented in the gallery, next to a label about the work and the fictional artist, Estario Benngarten, who supposedly created it:\n",
      "The AI's description:\n",
      "This painting is of a little girl with a TV for a head, it is titled \"You Are What You Watch\" she has a pink dress and stands against a blurry white background. This painting is a commentary on the growing obsession with television and the way it has taken over our lives... (Read the full text).\n",
      "BLOCK: In addition to the paintings, I wallpapered the gallery with images for other potential paintings in sets of five. So, if a collector comes in and chooses one of those five outputs to turn into a final oil painting, they themselves become part of the artwork creation process through their curation of the work.\n",
      "BLOCK: For the past several months, I've also been producing AI sculptures, moving from 2D to 3D. As of this moment, these AI-imagined sculptures are being 3D-printed in plastic, cut from paper, molded in fiberglass, sculpted in ceramic, or cast in bronze, bringing the digital to a near-immortal and ancient material and process.\n",
      "BLOCK: Of course, with the proliferation of these technologies, there have been detractors of this new art form. For example, Charles Baudelaire writes: \"This industry, by invading the territories of art, has become art's most mortal enemy.\"\n",
      "Actually, that was written in 1859, and Baudelaire was talking about a newfangled invention, the camera. Time would prove him wrong: photography became art, and other forms of media continued just fine.\n",
      "AI art is still in the \"ooo-shiny\" phase where its inherent newness is interesting enough to hold attention, just as I would imagine the 1896 film \"Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat\" was at the dawn of filmmaking. It will be those using these tools in a conceptually rigorous way that push it from being a novelty into fine art.\n",
      "I see my own work as a playful investigation into a human-machine symbiosis and a glimpse into the possible futures of artmaking. My hope is that these artworks act as a conduit to encourage people to think about what our symbiotic future with intelligent machines might look like. I've been interested in human-machine symbiosis for over a decade, and I see the machine learning tools of the last few years as a huge leap forward in what it means to collaborate with AI.\n",
      "As technology becomes more of an extension and amplification of our minds – just as a wrench is an extension of our hands and amplifies our physical ability – AI becomes more of a collaborator rather than a calculator. Unlike creative tools of the past, such as Photoshop, photographs or pigments, we are now working with tools that seem to have generative imagination, but perhaps no \"taste\". The human in the loop adds an important curatorial role in determining the \"good\" versus \"bad\".\n",
      "I believe we are on the cusp of a new artistic movement, and I view these tools as the beginning of the next great period of creative expression. As the surface-level novelty wears off, works of fine art will emerge. Just as we have entire museums dedicated to photography, I'd be on the lookout for the same for AI.\n",
      "*Alexander Reben is an artist and MIT-trained roboticist whose work probes the inherently human nature of the artificial. He investigates our relationships with algorithms, automation and amplification using experimentation and prototyping, absurdity and humor, and mischief and play to engage the public with complex ideas in technology in an approachable way.

      "HEADING The tensions that fan tricky in-law relationships\n",
      "BLOCK: IIn-law relationships hold the potential for mutual appreciation, joy and even love – in theory, people gain a whole new family and, with it, access to a wider support network. Most people don’t start off expecting to hate their in-laws; 2012 research from Purdue University, US, showed the vast majority of couples go into their marriages anticipating positive ties. \n",
      "Yet a potent mix of patriarchal traditions, media tropes and characters in pop culture also popularise the idea that in-law relationships will be tense at best, toxic at worst – especially among women. \n",
      "For instance, one needn’t look far to find a rich set of diabolical in-law characters. In Hamlet, Gertrude’s brother-in-law kills her husband, then lies to her to gain her hand in marriage. In the Meet The Parentsfilm series, Robert DeNiro’s character uses his ex-CIA skills to uncover dirt on his daughter’s fiancé (and that’s the least of it). The trope is particularly potent on television: in the Sopranos, Livia Soprano estranges her daughter-in-law Carmela from her own parents; the Simpsons sees Marge’s sisters Patty and Selma at constant odds with Homer Simpson; and Debra Barone and her mother-in-law Marie in Everybody Loves Raymondveer cyclically between niggling combat and genuine affection. \n",
      "Real-life examples of tricky in-laws bombard us, too, as evidenced by numerous reports on Zayn Malik’s rocky relationship with mother-in-law Yolanda Hadid, or Victoria Beckham’s purported feud with son Brooklyn’s wife, Nicola Peltz. The media’s thirst for woman-on-woman conflict takes a particularly dark sway, adding ballast to the looming figure of the monster-in-law in culture.    \n",
      "These representations serve to feed the assumption that in-law conflict is normal. And indeed, say experts, there are both well-founded historical reasons for these beliefs as well as particular flashpoints today – both events and life stages – that are known to fan the flames of in-law conflict, making stereotypically bad relationships very real for some.\n",
      "BLOCK: ‘Precarious environment’    \n",
      "Part of the reason that navigating in-law relationships can be tricky is the fact that there is no rulebook for them. For example, it’s not clear how close people should live to their in-laws, how often couples see them and what responsibilities they might shoulder. \n",
      "Gretchen Perry, professor at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, and co-author of the paper In-Law Relationships in Evolutionary Perspective: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, points out that there won’t necessarily be shared beliefs and mutual understanding. While people might have friction with their own families, she says, “it’s more likely you’re going to agree and have common interests with them”, while there might be “less of an overlap in common agreement” with in-laws. \n",
      "The historic formation of heterosexual family structures may be partly responsible for creating an environment of tension with in-laws, and form the basis of the trope of the meddling mother-in-law specifically. In some patrilineal societies, parents choose who their child marries, and once married, the daughter-in-law moves in with her husband’s family. \n",
      "As the senior woman of the household in these arrangements, the mother is in charge of the domestic sphere, and gains higher social status and decision-making authority over her daughter-in-law. “It’s a precarious environment because the new wife is separated from their family of origin and those who may be more protective of her,” says Perry. “Depending on the nature of that circumstance, it can be a difficult, controlling environment, with a lot of conflict.” So, experts say the omnipresent trope of the meddling mother-in-law is partly a hangover from this set-up, where a daughter-in-law is under the thumb of a matriarch. \n",
      "Today, these kinds of living arrangements are far less common, but statistics still support the belief that a woman and her mother-in-law are more likely to clash than male members of the family.    \n",
      "In a US study from 2022, both men and women reported having more conflict with their mothers-in-law than their mothers, and mothers indicated having more conflict with their daughters-in-law than their daughters. Terri Apter, a psychologist and senior tutor at Newnham College, Cambridge University, who conducted more than two decades of research, and published in a book in 2008, found that 60% of women admitted the relationship with their female in-law caused them long-term unhappiness and stress. Two-thirds of daughters-in-law believed that their husband's mother frequently exhibited jealous, maternal love towards their son. Seventy-five percent of couples reported having problems with an in-law, but only 15% of mother-in-law/son-in-law relationships were described as tense.\n",
      "\n",
      "BLOCK: \n",
      "One factor that could contribute to the prevalence of female in-law tension is child-rearing, and its disproportionate impact on women, which could potentially compound any pre-existing conflict. \n",
      "In a Finnish study, researchers found that compared to child-free couples, mothers and fathers were as likely to report conflict with their own parents, but more likely to report individual conflict with their in-laws. Many young adults found in-law conflict increased after the birth of their first child, with the shared interest of a grandchild providing fresh reasons for grandparents to “influence and interfere in the lives of other family members”. \n",
      "During the early child-rearing period, new mothers and their mothers-in-law may well have more frequent contact than before. “When pregnant, breastfeeding and caring for a young baby, mothers are faced with a challenging time and need extra support,” explains Perry. Although a new mother’s partner and father-in-law can help, it’s often her own mother and mother-in-law who provide the most robust support. Plus, child-rearing is an emotive topic that comes with a plethora of generational differences. With a mother-in-law expecting to have her grandchild raised one way, and an exhausted mother adamant about doing some things differently, the conditions are ripe for disagreements. \n",
      "Helping a mother through the early months of parenthood is just the beginning of the grandparental care journey, however. More so than grandfathers, it is grandmothers who often cover gaps in childcare, which can result in their own work hours being curtailed and a drop in earnings potential. Yet more help does not necessarily equate to better ties. The Finnish study found that the more grandchild care a paternal grandmother performs, the more likely a daughter-in-law is to report some form of conflict - the rule of thumb being, the more involved they are in each other’s lives, the more opportunities there are for friction.\n",
      "BLOCK: Holiday flashpoints \n",
      "While the mother-in-law to daughter-in-law link is surely the most complex, all in-law relationships come under tension as couples move through life together. The most frequent intra-familial flashpoints are religious celebrations and holidays. “If both sets of in-laws are adamant that you’re all going to theirs for Christmas, you’re going to have a problem,” says Martin Daly, a professor of psychology, neuroscience and behaviour at McMaster University, Canada and co-author of In-Law Relationships in Evolutionary Perspective. “Occasions like Christmas are a major point of conflict, because it’s where people are expected to be together.” \n",
      "Thrown together for an extended period of time, without sufficient room for autonomous behaviours, families come up against the phenomenon of ‘hypercopresence,’ which can happen with any interaction involving forced closeness – holiday gatherings included. Melanie Booth-Butterfield, a professor of communication studies at West Virginia University, US, who is writing a book on the topic, says that the negative effects can be long-lasting. “Hypercopresence can result in conflicts with relatives, angry words that cannot be taken back, and cold, rude nonverbal behaviours which leave lasting impressions,” she explains. \n",
      "Plus, holidays are when families carry out much-anticipated traditions and rituals, which research shows makes them feel closer and increases people’s enjoyment of these occasions. However, each family’s traditions might be different – and when in-laws diverge from our beloved rituals and traditions (or vice versa), tensions can flare. \n",
      "There are other common points of conflict, says Perry, including potentially different opinions on how much time, including holidays, that you spend together, how children are raised, how money is spent, whether money is borrowed and so on. Indeed, a 2016 survey by digital lifestyle brand Fatherly showed that of those couples who do argue with their in-laws, 29% said it was about parenting style, followed by 15% who brought up politics, 14% said money and 4% said their in-laws needled them about career success. \n",
      "More space, less tension \n",
      "Perry believes that building positive in-law relations can depend on how much people rely on extended families as they move through life. Tensions may occur when couples can’t afford to live independently, grandparents shoulder more childcare responsibilities and adults take on the care of their parents as they age. “If social constraints and financial shortfall mean that people need to care for each other more, and spend more time in each other’s business, the conflict may increase,” says Perry. \n",
      "But these days, it’s becoming more common for couples to operate as solitary units, moving further away from a larger familial network, and staying in touch on their own terms. “If couples can be independent and flexible, not beholden to in-laws and extended families, they can pick and choose when they ask for help, [then] the window of opportunity for conflict is smaller,” says Perry. \n",
      "And while some people may struggle with in-law relationships, it’s also clear that people can also build positive, rewarding ties. A survey of American women conducted in 2021 found that 51% of daughters-in-law are satisfied or very satisfied with the relationship with their mother-in-law, while three quarters of mothers-in-law are satisfied or very satisfied with the relationship with their daughter-in-law. \n",
      "So where does that leave us? These days, it’s certainly possible that some of the foundational areas of conflict with in-laws might be reduced, due to the different ways we live today. But the stereotypes do contain a grain of truth, as there are inherent aspects of these relationships that could serve to make them fraught. Usually, though, they aren’t as extreme as the ones we see on television. \n",
      "Moreover, people go through countless changes through in life, and there are just as many opportunities to reframe in-law relationships – even during the holidays. After all, you have one irrefutable attachment in common. As Daly points out, people related by marriage often derive solidarity from the fact they care deeply about the wellbeing of the same person.\n",

      "HEADING Duna de Bolonia: The Spanish sand dune hiding Roman ruins\n",
      "BLOCK: NNear the southern tip of Spain's Cádiz province, where Europe lunges into the Strait of Gibraltar as if reaching out for the North African coast, the Duna de Bolonia is one of the continent's largest sand dunes. Rising more than 30m high and sprawling 200m wide, the white mound spills into the azure sea and appears as if someone has dumped a massive pile of sugar atop the surrounding Estrecho Nature Park's protected green forest.\n",
      "Like all sand dunes, Bolonia is a constantly moving ecosystem that shifts with the winds. But as climate change has intensified the hurricane-force gusts coming from the east, the dune has increasingly migrated inland towards the ecologically important cork and pine forests and scrubland – revealing remnants of the many past cilivilisations who have passed through here in the process.\n",
      "BLOCK: In recent years, archaeological excavations have identified ancient burial tombs that were once hidden deep within the dune's depths. Experts aren't sure just how many chambers lie underneath, but because the sand has helped to preserve bones and the structure's foundation, the necropolis remains remarkably intact, yielding artefacts like jewellery and arrowheads.\n",
      "Nearby, the Baelo Claudia archaeological site dates to the 2nd Century BCE and is one of Spain's best-preserved Roman settlements. Complete with ancient baths, a theatre, temple, forum, aqueducts and sweeping views towards Morocco, the site was built atop a previous Phoenician settlement and was one of the empire's major sources of garum fish sauce production. After a 3rd-Century CE earthquake, the settlement was gradually abandoned, only to be discovered many centuries later under the sand.\n",
      "As the winds continue to shape and shift this unique landscape, historians are hopeful that Bolonia will remain protected and keep revealing more of its secrets for future generations.\n",

      "BLOCK: Bob Dylan has issued a rare public statement to apologise for using a machine to duplicate his signature on books and artworks since 2019.\n",
      "BLOCK: The star said he regretted making an \"error of judgment\" in allowing the works to be sold as hand-signed.\n",
      "BLOCK: He said he had started using an autopen after developing vertigo in 2019.\n",
      "BLOCK: The issue came to light when fans who bought $600, limited-edition copies of Dylan's book The Philosophy of Modern Song compared photos of his signature.\n",
      "BLOCK: The publisher, Simon & Schuster, initially refused requests for refunds, assuring buyers that the signatures were legitimate and validated by a \"letter of authenticity\".\n",
      "BLOCK: After continued pressure, they admitted the books contained a \"penned replica\" of the star's autograph, and offered full refunds to everyone who had bought one of the 900 \"hand-signed\" editions.\n",
      "BLOCK: The row also raised questions over Dylan's artworks, prints of which can sell for up to $15,000 (Â£12,400).\n",
      "BLOCK: In a statement released on Friday, the singer-songwriter admitted that some of those had also been signed by machine.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I've hand-signed each and every art print over the years, and there's never been a problem,\" he wrote.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"However, in 2019 I had a bad case of vertigo and it continued into the pandemic years. It takes a crew of five working in close quarters with me to help enable these signing sessions, and we could not find a safe and workable way to complete what I needed to do while the virus was raging.   \n",
      "BLOCK: \"So, during the pandemic, it was impossible to sign anything and the vertigo didn't help. With contractual deadlines looming, the idea of using an auto-pen was suggested to me, along with the assurance that this kind of thing is done 'all the time' in the art and literary worlds.  \n",
      "BLOCK: \"Using a machine was an error in judgment and I want to rectify it immediately.  I'm working with Simon & Schuster and my gallery partners to do just that.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Castle Fine Art, a UK art retailer that sells prints of Dylan's paintings, said they had been \"entirely unaware of the use of autopen\".\n",
      "BLOCK: Only two collections, both released in 2022, were affected, it said in a statement. \"All other editions were individually hand signed by Bob Dylan himself.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Buyers who own a machine-signed print will be offered a full refund. However, they will be asked to \"exchange the current certificate of authenticity for one reflecting the autopen signature\".\n",
      "BLOCK: The autopen was first patented in the USA in 1803, and allowed a machine to replicate a person's signature as they wrote. US president Thomas Jefferson was an early proponent of the system, purchasing two: One for the White House and another for his house in Monticello.\n",
      "BLOCK: The modern version does not require the signatory to be present - instead storing a digital version of their handwriting, which a robot arm can reproduce.\n",
      "BLOCK: President Obama was the first person to use one to sign a bill into law; and the device is commonplace in the art and literature world.\n",
      "BLOCK: Van Morrison was recently accused of using autopen to sign CDs, although his management issued a statement denying it. \n",
      "BLOCK: Sinead O'Connor admitted to signing her memoir with the device, saying: \"I  was not in a position to hand write my name 10,000 times, which is how many I was asked to sign. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"My son was unwell as was I\".\n",
      "BLOCK: In both these instances, the disputed items were selling for about Â£30, limiting the potential for uproar - although many retailers withdrew the autographed copies of O'Connor's book from sale.\n",

      "HEADING Jeff Bezos: Does US-style philanthropy exist in UK?\n",
      "BLOCK: Philanthropy, the ennobling pursuit of the rich and famous, is in the headlines. But what does philanthropy mean in 2022? And does it mean the same thing in the US as it does in the UK, asks Stephen Smith. \n",
      "BLOCK: The American bitcoin wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried was one of the leading lights in a new philanthropy movement known as \"Effective Altruism\" (EA). \n",
      "BLOCK: Instead of toiling away for a charity, supporters of EA favour making pots of money in finance and tech instead, and then giving it away to charity. But the 30-year-old Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, went bankrupt earlier this month. \n",
      "BLOCK: Overnight, his riches vanished - he had been worth $10.5bn (Â£8.68bn) on paper, or rather, in evanescent digital code. As for his creditors, far from congratulating themselves on the effectiveness of their altruism, they are now out of pocket by as much as $8bn. \n",
      "BLOCK: Meanwhile, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced his intention to give \"most of my fortune away\" in his lifetime, a generous-sounding gesture for a man who is worth $117.5bn according to Forbes. He has already parted with $2.4bn over his working life, says the same source. \n",
      "BLOCK: It's not clear how Bezos intends to make good on his promise. He hasn't signed the Giving Pledge, a scheme launched by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet to persuade their fellow super-rich that they should donate most of their assets to charity. \n",
      "BLOCK: And critics have pointed out that Bezos's staggering wealth is not unconnected to his company's record on tax. In the UK, Amazon pays tax on its profits but not its sales, handing over Â£492m in direct taxation to Customs and Revenue last year on takings of a whopping Â£20.63bn.\n",
      "BLOCK: The company has been accused of low wages and poor working conditions, and Amazon workers in territories across the globe staged walkouts on Black Friday.  \n",
      "BLOCK: Bankman-Fried and Bezos have had plenty of attention for their pronouncements on philanthropy, in marked contrast to the awkward silence which surrounds the subject on this side of the Atlantic. \n",
      "BLOCK: The British are reluctant to discuss their efforts on behalf of good causes, so much so that even the humble-brag \"I don't like to talk about my charity work\" is enough to bring on an attack of the vapours in certain self-effacing circles. Or so we like to tell ourselves. \n",
      "BLOCK: In recent years, a new kind of philanthropist has emerged in the UK - the activist sports star or musician. Footballer Marcus Rashford topped the Sunday Times Giving List in 2021 for his campaign against food poverty and this year's leading donors include racing driver Lewis Hamilton, footballer Mo Salah and rapper Stormzy. \n",
      "BLOCK: Nonetheless, aspects of culture - and tax - help to explain differing attitudes to philanthropy in the UK and US. Americans gave $484.85bn to charity in 2021, according to the National Philanthropic Trust (NPT) in the States. \n",
      "BLOCK: Britons donated Â£10.7bn, says the Charities Aid Foundation. The US has roughly five times the population of the UK but Americans give 45 times as much.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"Rich people in the US face expectations that those who've made it financially will give some - or a lot - away,\" says Dr Beth Breeze, director of the Centre for Philanthropy at the University of Kent.  \n",
      "BLOCK: She says \"success\" in the US is judged not only by how much an individual makes but also by how open-handedly they give away. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"It's about being both the richest and the most philanthropic, as Bill Gates, who topped both lists for many years, exemplifies. No such expectation exists yet in the UK. Philanthropic people may get praise here but the non-philanthropic wealthy do not typically come under any social pressure to emulate their more generous peers.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: US fundraising is the most developed in the world, according to Dr Breeze, with highly skilled campaigners building long-term relationships with those able to make big gifts. \n",
      "BLOCK: Bezos lives in a cultural context that expects people like him to give, she adds, and his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott is the most admired contemporary philanthropist.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"The only surprise is that this combination of factors has not led to him pledging to give it all away any sooner.\" \n",
      "BLOCK: Source: Sunday Times Giving List\n",
      "BLOCK: Churches are the biggest group of beneficiaries from American philanthropy, reflecting the insistence of the founding fathers on free, independent religious communities, separate from the state. Faith organisations received 27% of donations in 2021, according to the NPT. \n",
      "BLOCK: The US also has a strong attachment to the idea of small government. Taxes and spending are low in comparison with Europe. To offset this, there's been a tradition of \"noblesse oblige\"ââââ on the part of America's wealthiest dynasties. Art is a good case in point. The great museums and galleries of the US would be practically bare without the generosity of private donors; in the UK, the wealthy typically leave their pictures to the nation to avoid paying death duties.\n",
      "BLOCK: But you don't have to peer very far back into British history to discover a pattern of philanthropy at least as significant in shaping society as gifting by billionaires is in contemporary America. \n",
      "BLOCK: Instead of tech tycoons dispensing their largesse, it was the pioneers of the industrial revolution in Britain who were signing the cheques, and they acted out of self-consciously godly motives the way many American benefactors do today. \n",
      "BLOCK: In the 19th Century, one of the great textile barons, Titus Salt, built homes and schools for the workers who toiled in his Yorkshire mills. He even named his new town after himself - Saltaire. He decreed it would be free of alcohol. This chimed with his nonconformist beliefs, but also meant fewer days would be lost to drink-related illnesses and injuries. \n",
      "BLOCK: Salt's model was followed by the Lever Brothers who were manufacturing soap powder on Merseyside. They built a garden village to house their workers and called it Port Sunlight, though apparently not in ironic commentary on the rainy local climate. The Levers permitted a pub among the tied houses of Port Sunlight, but it was alcohol-free. \n",
      "BLOCK: Jonathan Ruffer, 71, a religious-minded City trader who has lavished millions of his own money on his native north-east England, is a throwback to those God-fearing Victorian grandees. \n",
      "BLOCK: He is the investor behind a spectacular pageant, Kynren, a whistlestop tour of British history which is staged in the grounds of Ruffer's home, the former palace of the Bishops of Auckland, to generate funds for the area. It's reported that Mr Ruffer's generosity is worth Â£50,000 a day to the deprived community of Bishop Auckland. \n",
      "BLOCK: On the face of it, little connects the mutton-chopped worthies who built places like Saltaire and Bournville with the tech bros of Silicon Valley. \n",
      "BLOCK: But creating state-of-the-art accommodation for the workers and surrounding it with recreational facilities yet frowning on the scourge of alcohol - all of this is out of the Silicon Valley playbook if recent reports about temperance  are correct, except that the Victorian industrialists were on to it a century or more earlier. \n",
      "BLOCK: In philanthropy, what goes around comes around. \n",
      "BLOCK: Like Bezos and others, the industrial barons of Victorian England accumulated vast private fortunes largely untroubled by taxes, dazzling everybody with their good works. \n",

      "HEADING Should we get rid of air miles for climate change?\n",
      "BLOCK: FFlying is very far from being a green activity. A return flight from Lisbon to New York generates nearly the same level of CO2 as the average person in the EU does by heating their home all year round.\n",
      "Compared with land transport, a plane requires a lot more energy, says Agnes Jocher, a professor at the Technical University of Munich, whose research explores sustainable future mobility. The result is a disproportionate climate impact compared to alternatives (trains and ferries, to name a few).\n",
      "In a 2019 report on reducing emissions through behaviour change, Richard Carmichael, a social sciences researcher at Imperial College London, observed that flying was a \"uniquely high-impact activity\" and \"the quickest and cheapest way for a consumer to increase their carbon footprint\".\n",
      "BLOCK: Rather than simply capping travellers' ability to fly, Carmichael suggested an alternative: to limit the perks that travellers get from airlines. Among his recommendations, Carmichael proposed an outright ban on air miles and frequent flyer loyalty programmes that he says incentivise \"excessive\" flying.\n",
      "By one estimate, trips taken using air miles account for around 10% of overall bookings. But could axing these schemes curb rising aviation emissions? Or would such a policy be fruitless – and efforts to reduce aviation be better spent elsewhere? The answer is more complicated that it might initially seem.\n",
      "You might also like:\n",
      "\n",
      "The fastest way aviation could cut its carbon emissions\n",
      "What would a flying-free world look like?\n",
      "Is seaweed the future of flying?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aviation loyalty programmes are around 40 years old. Texas International Airlines, a now-defunct carrier, created the first one in 1979. At the time, governments were easing restrictions over which carriers could fly, where they could fly to, and when, so competition between carriers intensified. Airline execs needed new ways to boost their brand. One solution? Offer flyers something extra to secure their loyalty – an IOU that could be cashed in later.\n",
      "Paying passengers would earn \"miles\" based on how often and how far they flew, which could then be exchanged for a complementary trip. Although these programmes have since evolved (today's flyers are also rewarded based on how much they spend), the underlying premise remains the same.\n",
      "Some climate activists suggest that it's time to scrap these schemes. \"The very last thing we should be doing is reward frequent flyers,\" says Herwig Schuster, a transport campaigner for Greenpeace. \"Frequent flyer programmes are not fair to the climate and the majority of people worldwide who almost never fly. We cannot allow airlines to incentivise a lifestyle that's destroying the planet while they receive major tax cuts and subsidies, and fill their pockets by selling more flight tickets.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: And sell more flight tickets carriers do. Passengers crisscross the globe four billion times annually. Each can pick from over 22,000 routes flown by over 25,000 commercial jets that collectively account for over 42 million flights. That puts total miles travelled in the air globally in the trillions, a potential gold mine for frequent fliers often courted by carriers.\n",
      "Today, banking air miles also no longer requires getting in the air. In fact, it is estimated that over half of all such miles are earned through non-flying related activities. This is because airlines have formed lucrative partnerships with third parties: credit card companies, car rental agencies and hotel chains, to name a few.\n",
      "BLOCK: But does earning these miles make people fly more? It turns out that snapping up miles is one thing, using them, another. This disconnect may seem surprising, but \"breakage\" – industry parlance for miles that go unused – does occur.\n",
      "North American airline trade body, Airlines for America (A4A), declined to comment on the prevalence of breakage in the industry. However, global consulting firm McKinsey has calculated that up to 30% of all air miles go unused: it estimates that over 30 trillion frequent-flier miles are currently sitting unspent in accounts (enough to give a free one-way flight to almost all of the roughly four billion passengers that fly in a year).\n",
      "There are several reasons for this breakage. Sometimes miles expire. Sometimes flyers don't have enough miles to get somewhere they really want to go. And when they do have enough miles, finding \"reward space\" – airline seats that can be booked using those miles – can be a challenge (more on that later).\n",
      "BLOCK: Likewise, when miles are used, flyers now have more choice of what types of rewards to splurge on. Rather than only locking in free travel, the sole \"go-to\" for travellers of yesteryear, other choices now abound. Passengers can opt for hotel nights, electronics, gift cards or even football shirts.\n",
      "And then of course there's what many travellers consider the biggest attraction: upgrades to premium cabins on an airplane. With enough miles on hand, you can move from the back of a jet to the front: from a place where cuts, squeezes and exasperation are the norm to a space where courtesy abounds, champagne flows freely and Michelin-starred meals await.\n",
      "Flying first or business class, however, may have a far larger carbon impact than flying economy as it occupies more space on the plane, meaning more emissions per person. The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates that flying premium leads to emissions per passenger two to three times greater than flying in economy, depending on the type of aircraft.\n",
      "In sum, though, not all miles are used, not all miles are used to fly, and when they are, they are sometimes used to make flying more comfortable (versus securing a spot onboard).\n",
      "BLOCK: Airline execs seem content with doling out miles. But how do they feel about people redeeming them?\n",
      "If each passenger cashed in on their unspent miles, carbon emissions would jump. But those trips can only be taken if miles can be redeemed without restrictions (e.g. for any flight, at any time, without any additional fees). And airline execs make sure that's almost never the case.\n",
      "The reason? Fare-paying passengers are more valuable to carriers than freeloading flyers. If an airline thinks a seat can be sold for more than the miles equivalent, it will make trading miles for that seat hard, if not impossible. Data backs up this sentiment. Over time, the share of flights paid in miles has fallen and a recent experiment from CBS News in the US found no seat availability for miles in key markets for 45 days straight.\n",
      "BLOCK: Carmichael says he supports flights that do fly being full rather than having lots of empty seats, since it's more efficient. But \"how that is achieved fairly without stimulating demand for flying\" requires more scrutiny, he says. Work is also needed to see which miles and rewards schemes incentivise extra flying, he adds.\n",
      "Carmichael and others also stress the need to reduce energy-intensive activities like flying altogether. The International Energy Agency, for example, has pointed to the need to reduce demand for flying through measures such as taxes on flights, as part of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Some campaigners and researchers have called for a policy that amounts to the very opposite of frequent flier rewards – a \"frequent flier levy\" whereby the more someone flies, the higher a tax they have to pay on each flight.\n",
      "But could air passengers ever go along with measures to reduce flying? Lucia Reisch, a professor of behavioural economics and policy at the University of Cambridge, thinks so. \"The past years have seen a general tendency of consumers to be more interested in and engage more in sustainable consumption,\" she says. Alongside taxes or regulations, so-called \"soft policy tools\" – like simply providing people with information or nudges towards flying less – are one way to do this, she says, and \"can be very successful, effective, [and] are often highly accepted\".\n",
      "Frequent flier programmes might seem like an obvious target, but in reality, their contribution to aviation emissions is small compared with the emissions reductions we need.\n",

      "HEADING The floating solar panels that track the Sun\n",
      "BLOCK: OOn a lake in the Netherlands, a shiny circular island floats, covered in dozens of shimmering solar panels.\n",
      "But this is no normal solar array, nor even simply one of the many new floating solar farms being installed in lakes, reservoirs and coastal areas across the world. That's because its panels are doing something none of these other floating solar farms can do: meticulously tracking and following the Sun as it moves across the sky, to catch as many rays as possible.\n",
      "This glistening installation, named Proteus after the ancient Greek sea god, is among the first to combine floating solar panels with Sun-tracking technology – all in an effort to maximise the amount of clean electricity it can produce.\n",
      "The island, floating in Oostvoornse Meer, a lake in the south-west Netherlands, is covered in 180 of these moving solar panels, with a total installed capacity of 73 kilowatt of peak power (kWp). It's a tiny amount in a world rapidly trying to switch to renewable energy, but SolarisFloat, the Portuguese company which built Proteus, believes this small installation could be scaled up to generate large amounts of clean electricity – and, crucially, without taking up valuable land.\n",
      "Solar revolution\n",
      "From the Brazilian Amazon to Japan, floating solar panels are experiencing a boom around the world. Floating solar capacity has grown hugely in the past decade, from 70 MWp in 2015 to 1,300MWp in 2020. The market for the technology is expected to grow by 43% a year over the next decade, reaching $24.5bn (£21.7bn) by 2031.\n",
      "\"Floating solar is a rather new [renewable energy] option, but it has huge potential globally,\" says Thomas Reindl, deputy chief executive of the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (Seris). Covering just 10% of all man-made reservoirs in the world with floating solar would result in an installed capacity of 20 Terawatts (TW) – 20 times more than the global solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity today, according to an analysis by Seris seen by BBC Future Planet.\n",
      "The rise of floating solar technology is among the latest trends in the revolutionary expansion of solar PV electricity in recent years. Globally, solar PV capacity has increased almost 12-fold in the past decade, from 72GW in 2011 to 843GW in 2021. The technology now accounts for 3.6% of global electricity generation, up from 0.03% in 2006. At the same time, solar arrays have seen an astonishing price drop which has made them the world's cheapest source of power.\n",
      "Further expanses in solar energy are expected – in fact, capacity needs to reach six times the current amount by 2030 to stay on track with a net zero emission world, according to the International Energy Agency. Global geopolitics are also playing a role in rising reliance on solar power: the European Union has proposed a massive ramping up of renewable energy as it aims to reduce its reliance on Russian oil and gas in the wake of the country's invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "BLOCK: Alongside this massive growth, researchers continue to look for improvements in solar technology. Most of the solar panels installed so far across the world lie on solid land. But solar technologies which float on water offer a unique advantage: they don't take up land space that may be needed for other uses.\n",
      "\"Renewable energy production is going to increase all around the world,\" says Antonio Duarte, the lead technical engineer at SolarisFloat. \"Solar installations are going to increase much more on water [than] land. Why? Because land is becoming a very precious asset.\"\n",
      "In a world looking to rapidly expand solar arrays, this gives floating solar a significant edge, especially for countries facing land scarcity. Conventional solar farms are often criticised for the amount of land they occupy – land which could otherwise be used to grow crops to feed the world's growing population, or carbon-absorbing trees. Solar energy requires a huge amount of space, at least 40-50 times more than coal plants and 90-100 times more than gas, according to research by Leiden University in The Netherlands.\n",
      "Conservationists have also expressed concern that land-based solar and wind farms can have a harmful impact on biodiversity, especially those that are built in species-rich areas.\n",
      "Building sun-absorbing technology on water is therefore a smart way to free up land, while also making use of unoccupied lakes and reservoirs. Countries such as Japan and Singapore are investing heavily in floating solar farms because of limited land availability or very expensive land.\n",
      "BLOCK: But currently less than 1% of the world's solar installations are floating, says Michael Walls, a professor at the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology at Loughborough University, in the UK. This is partly due to technical and financial constraints – saltwater causes corrosion and positioning panels at an angle is tricky and expensive on a floating platform, Walls says. Installations on freshwater bodies may also face opposition if they compete with other activities, such as swimming, boating or angling, he adds.\n",

      "\n",
      "Still, floating sun-powered farms also solve another problem plaguing conventional solar energy: inefficiency when solar panels become too hot. In fact, floating solar panels generate extra energy because of the cooling effect of the water they hover over.\n",
      "Solar panels generate electricity using rays of light from the Sun – not its heat. But when they become too hot, their efficiency falls. This is because heat excites the panel's electrons, which convert energy from the Sun into electricity, making the difference between the high energy and rest state smaller, which in turn decreases the voltage and the amount of electricity generated. Solar PV panels typically operate at peak efficiency between 15C and 35C (59F and 95F), but they can get as hot as 65C (149F), hindering efficiency.\n",
      "The proximity to water of floating solar helps the panels operate more efficiently and increases their electricity production by up to 15%, says Nuno Correia, director of composite materials at the Institute of Science and Innovation in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering in Porto, who developed the Proteus project.\n",
      "Follow the Sun\n",
      "But there are also other ways to boost the energy production of solar panels – such as by tilting them to follow the Sun's path in the sky, similar to the way young sunflowers follow the sun from east to west during the day. Tracking technology, which is already in use on some land based solar arrays, helps increase the overall electricity production, as the panels constantly adjust to face the Sun.\n",
      "Double-sided panels that track the Sun could increase energy production by 35% and reduce the average cost of electricity by 16% compared to conventional systems, according to research by SERIS. Demand for tracking technology for solar panels is expected to grow by 16% per year between 2022 and 2030 due to this efficiency boost.\n",
      "By merging the two technologies, SolarisFloat says it can increase electricity production by up to 40%, compared to static land installations.\n",
      "SolarisFloat built Proteus as a pilot project, to test this cutting-edge technology and analyse how it boosts the generation of clean energy. The prototype landed them a position as a finalist for the European Inventor Award this year.\n",
      "Proteus' single-sidedpanels slowly rotate every few hours on two axes, using mechanical, geospatial and light sensors to precisely follow the elevation of the Sun's path, as it moves from east to west.\n",
      "BLOCK: There are plenty of suitable locations for tracking systems such as Proteus, but the most likely niches are installations in higher latitudes that will not experience strong winds, says Reindl. Locations must be chosen carefully to avoid tidal forces and stormy weather from destroying the panels as well as their mooring and anchoring systems.\n",
      "Tracking systems will also not make much difference at locations near the equator, where the panels are installed almost horizontal and face the Sun throughout most of the day, notes Reindl.\n",
      "Adding trackers increases the overall capital and maintenance costs of the installation, says Walls. But the electricity gains make this technology a worthwhile investment, \"especially in sunbelt locations,\" he says.\n",
      "Another downside to Sun-tracking solar arrays positioned on water is that they are challenging to install, Duarte acknowledges. \"Land tracking systems are [typically] 'anchored' to the ground by poles and only a platform with the [solar panel] modules on top of the poles moves,\" he explains. To ensure stability on water, propellers and engines have been installed on Proteus's platform to anchor the panels.\n",
      "\"It remains to be seen what the maximum wind speeds and wave heights would be which the system can absorb while still working smoothly and reliably over time,\" says Reindl.\n",
      "Eco-advantages\n",
      "Linking tracking technology with floating solar could increase electricity generation, but the benefits extend beyond this. Floating solar can help reduce evaporation and prevent the spread of toxic algal blooms, both of which threaten water supply, scientists say.\n",
      "Floating solar installations cool water temperatures by shielding the surface from the sun. This prevents the growth of toxic blooms of blue-green algae, which thrive in warmer waters and can produce harmful toxins that cause eye and skin irritation as well as vomiting among humans and serious illness or even death in animals.\n",
      "The cooler temperatures also prevent evaporation of water – an especially important advantage in arid areas where water is a precious resource. A 2021 study found that floating solar panels on a reservoir in Jordan, one of the world's most water-scarce countries, reduced evaporation by 42%, while producing 425 MWh of electricity annually.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"If done well in the right place, floating solar has the potential to provide much needed low carbon energy without taking up land and whilst improving [the] water body condition,\" says Alona Armstrong, senior lecturer in energy and environmental sciences at Lancaster University and co-author of a study reviewing the environmental benefits and risks of floating solar farms. \"Our research shows that floating solar cools the water body and reduces phytoplankton biomass.\" High concentrations of phytoplankton biomass can boost the growth of algal blooms.\n",
      "However, there could also be ecological disadvantages to wider use of floating solar. Floating solar panels could affect stratification, layers in the water body with different properties, in response to changes in solar radiation and wind at the surface. An increase in stratification could cause the bottom layer to become deoxygenated, \"causing undesirable increases in nutrient concentrations and killing fish\", Armstrong's study notes.\n",
      "\"Floating solar could cause beneficial and detrimental impacts to the water body, and likely a combination of both,\" says Armstrong. \"It's all about ensuring it's done well and in the right place.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Floating solar panels can also offer useful advantages when combined with other clean technologies. For one thing, there is a \"huge opportunity\" to merge floating solar with existing hydropower infrastructure, says Reindl. This would help tackle one of renewable energy's biggest challenges: how to provide a steady power supply during variable weather conditions.\n",
      "\"You could use solar during the day and hydro at night,\" says Reindl. \"If you do it in a smart way, you could in principle use the reservoir as a giant battery.\"\n",
      "Hydro dams are the world's largest renewable energy source. But in some areas of the world, such as Africa, increasing droughts caused by climate change could threaten their future potential, the International Energy Agency has warned.  One study found that solar panels floating on just 1% of Africa's hydropower reservoirs could double the continent's hydropower capacity and increase electricity generation from dams by 58%. There is \"strong potential\" for an installation such as Proteus to be used in combination with existing hydropower infrastructure to boost electricity generation, says Duarte.\n",
      "As demand for renewable energy soars and climate impacts such as droughts increase, SolarisFloat says their technology offers a \"win-win solution\". The high cost of materials, such as steel and plastic, needed to build the panels and the complex installation are the major hurdles which are stalling the global rollout of installations such as Proteus.\n",
      "To be a commercial success, SolarisFloat not only needs to demonstrate an increase in electricity production, but also show that initial investments in the entire system and operational costs can be kept low, says Reindl.\n",
      "Still, it seems clear that the future for floating solar overall is bright, with the global market expected to grow by a fifth in the next eight years to $180.2m (£151.5m).\n",
      "Considering the world rapidly needs to ramp up renewable energy to avoid dangerous levels of warming, it needs all the help it can get. Floating, sun-tracking solar could help put the most efficient panels where they are urgently needed.\n",
      "This piece was updated on 22/11/22 to clarify that the effect of floating solar on stratification is not currently known.\n",

      "HEADING The surprising benefits of blue spaces\n",
      "BLOCK: AAmidst the gentle rock of the sea, the breeze tickling their skin and the distant caw of seagulls, six people in lifejackets close their eyes for a \"mindful check-in\". They are aboard the deck of Irene, a 120ft (37m) tall ship with timber frames and majestic sails which is cruising off the coast of Cornwall in the UK.\n",
      "These kind of mindfulness exercises have become increasingly mainstream in the last decade, but they tend to be practised from the comfort of the home or a therapist's office – not the deck of a ship.\n",
      "However, UK charity Sea Sanctuary, which operates Irene, believes its combination of marine activities and therapy provides a uniquely beneficial form of mental health support. A practitioner of \"blue health\" – the concept that being in or near blue spaces such as rivers, lakes and the sea boosts our emotional wellbeing – the charity has been organising trips around the Cornwall coastline since 2006.\n",
      "BLOCK: Many of the charity's client sailors, largely people who experience anxiety and depression, sign up to a voyage to benefit from sessions with the ship's therapist while also learning a new skill. They can be referred by charities and social workers or enrol themselves.\n",
      "Steve Ridholls, a former police officer, is sailing with Sea Sanctuary to calm the anxiety and PTSD he battles.\n",
      "\"I used to talk people down from cliffs and bridges or respond to suicides and car crashes,\" he says. \"I saw things my mind can't unsee. Much of my PTSD came from helplessness – when you witness something you can't do anything about.\"\n",
      "In 2014, Ridholls was signed off from the police force on mental health grounds. Now, he spends most days hugging the shoreline on his 16ft (5m) ­­­red canoe, paddling along Cornwall’s rivers, estuaries and bays. The ocean calms his mind – and, he believes, plays a key part in his recovery.\n",
      "BLOCK: When Homo sapiens first evolved some 300,000 years ago, we lived in grasslands and forests, next to lakes and rivers. It wasn't until 2007 that we became a majority-urban species. But as urbanisation increases, our access to nature continues to dwindle.\n",
      "The loss of human-nature interaction has been linked to a rising tide of mental health disorders. A growing body of evidence indicates that human health, both mental and physical, is intrinsically linked to nature.\n",
      "Just looking at natural scenery has been found to cause rapid beneficial psychological and physiological changes in salivary cortisol, blood flow, blood pressure and brain activity. Meanwhile, contact with microbes in the environment can \"train\" our immune systems, reinforcing the good microbial communities on our skin and in our airways and guts.\n",
      "BLOCK: But many experts now believe blue spaces, such as lakes and rivers, could be even more beneficial than green ones.\n",
      "\"Blue spaces provide us with distractions that take our mind away from the day-to-day hassles of life,\" says Kate Campbell, a health psychology researcher at Te Herenga Waka-Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. \"The sound of the crashing waves, the smell of salty air, the crunching of sand beneath our toes…The sensations relax our bodies and tell our minds to switch off.\"\n",
      "Campbell believes humans have \"an innate predisposition\" towards natural environments that once benefitted us as an evolving species. Natural spaces that provided pre-modern humans with food, comfort and safety are likely to provide a similar sense of ease even in today's urban world. Spending time in blue spaces, says Campbell, can feel like \"returning home\".\n",
      "The concept of blue health emerged almost 10 years ago when researchers at the University of Sussex asked 20,000 people to record their feelings at random times. They collected over a million responses and found that people were by far the happiest when they were in blue spaces.\n",
      "More recently, experts from Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) have found that spending time in blue spaces lowers the risk of stress, anxiety, obesity, cardiovascular disease and premature death.\n",
      "Niamh Smith, a researcher at GCU and co-author of the study, says the team found an impact on both mental and general health from spending time in blue spaces. The research also linked time spent in blue space to a reduction in body mass index (BMI) and a lower risk of mortality.\n",
      "\"People really value the therapeutic space,\" says Smith. \"They love the sound of running water, having a reflective space to quietly sit, a place to clear your head away from the busy-ness of daily life.\n",
      "\"We know there are four main ways that blue spaces benefit health – through physical activity, stress reduction, providing a space for socialisation [and finally the] environmental factors that have a knock on impact on our health. For example, if a river is tree-lined, you have shade.\"\n",
      "In fact, blue spaces are so good for your health they can be now prescribed by your doctor.\n",
      "Blue prescribing\n",
      "\"My depression comes in cycles,\" says Harune Akthar, speaking from his West London home.\n",
      "Around ten years ago, the 27-year-old was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, ADHD, depression and anxiety.\n",
      "\"When I had a bad day, it would take three to four days for me to come out of it,\" he says. \"I slept and ignored everyone including my family – and I love my family. I wouldn't eat. You'd rarely see me.\"\n",
      "For years, Akthar tried a range of different therapies but didn't find any that helped him. Then, in June this year, his doctor referred him to the Blue Prescribing scheme run by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), a charity.\n",
      "After the first day, he didn't think it was for him. By the end of the second, he couldn't wait to go back.\n",
      "BLOCK: Single parents, long-Covid sufferers and those with chronic conditions or poor mental health are among those who are eligible for the six-week programme, delivered at the WWT’s London Wetland Centre.     \n",
      "Once a week, participants go for guided walks in the wetlands. They also do sensory engagement activities – birdwatching, clay modelling, herbal tea tasting or creating \"scent cocktails\".\n",
      "According to the Mental Health Foundation (MHF), partners of WWT, 65% of people find being near water improves their mental wellbeing.\n",
      "\"When people consider what constitutes a psychologically restorative environment, they frequently report a preference for blue space,\" says Jonathan Reeves, a WWT health and wellbeing researcher. Watery environments, says Reeves, are less cognitively demanding than the everyday sights and sounds of our busy lives – and allow for \"soft fascination\". \"Think how easy it is to watch ripples in the water,\" he says.\n",
      "BLOCK: Akthar says being by the water has allowed his mind \"to pan out, to rest\". \"Now, when I feel down, I know to take a step back, breathe. Instead of having four days in my bed, I have one or two. It's amazing.\"\n",
      "This year, the University of Exeter is working with WWT and MHF’s blue prescribing team to lead a feasibility study that – if successful – will lead to a full clinical trial on nature prescribing over the next few years. The trials would evaluate nature as a treatment in the same way as medicines are assessed.\n",
      "Reeves says a medical focus on blue spaces could also help prevent health problems in the first place.\n",
      "\"Our health systems are overwhelmingly biased towards treating problems when they arise,\" he says. \"We should be spending more on preventative solutions and health promotion. In improving our blue spaces, the benefits would be felt in not only health but also the climate crisis, urban liveability, flooding, water quality, biodiversity and community cohesion.\"\n",

      "Even the sound of water can be enough to reduce stress in people.\n",
      "There are broadly two kinds of human attention: \"directed\", the intense concentration we might use when driving a car, and \"non-directed\", the involuntary attention we might give to distant noises or passing clouds. The sound of water can gently stimulate this non-directed attention, allowing our minds to rest.\n",
      "The rush of river currents and the sound of waves washing ashore fall into the category of “pink noise\". Like white noise, pink noise is made up of all the sound frequencies audible to the human ear – but with less volume at the higher frequencies. It has been found to aid sleep and improve memory.\n",
      "Some experts argue that entering the water provides yet another level of healing. Immersive activities like swimming or surfing induce a sense of environmental attunement – feeling connected to or even part of the environment.  \n",
      "At the Taputeranga Marine Reserve in New Zealand, just a stone's throw from Wellington’s city centre, a programme by the non-profit environmental trust Mountains to Sea Wellington gives young Māori people the opportunity to engage with their marine environment by immersing them in the Island Bay Snorkel Trail.\n",
      "BLOCK: Many of the children's families live in day-to-day survival mode and some have never seen the ocean before. Here, though, they see curious schools of fish zooming around and alien-like creatures hiding between rocks in a wonderland of swirling green and brown seaweed forests. Sunrays hit the red, algae-covered seabed and form dancing rainbows, reflected in the bubbles released by seaweed. Above the water, the mountains of New Zealand’s South Island stand tall in the distance.\n",
      "\"You'll find crayfish, big blue moki, camouflaged critters, colourful anemones and octopuses,\" says Nicole Miller, chair of Friends of the Taputeranga Marine Reserve Charitable Trust. \"It's special to see abundant marine life up close. To be able to put on a mask and snorkel, and experience the biodiversity beneath the surface, is a life-changing experience for them.\"\n",
      "Getting into the ocean this way gives the tamariki – the Māori children – a deep sense of connection with the environment, as well as feelings of accomplishment, pride and hope for the future. The snorkel experience has a profound impact on those who take the plunge, says Miller.\n",
      "\"We swam in the marine reserve. I saw so many fishes, pauas and crayfish – it's such a healing place for the soul,\" one student told Miller, after taking her first dip in the Taputeranga Marine Reserve.\n",
      "Urban water\n",
      "In a bid to bring blue health to more people, some experts are turning their attention to creating – or rediscovering – watery spaces within urban environments.\n",
      "Nearly 2.4 billion people around the world – that’s about 40% of the total global population – live within 100km (62 miles) of the sea. Yet more people live alongside rivers or on the shores of lakes. But obstacles – such as accessibility or pollution – can prevent people from soaking up the benefits of blue spaces.\n",
      "In 2016, a European research initiative, Blue Health, was founded to collect evidence on the health benefits of blue infrastructure in urban spaces.\n",
      "Its network of epidemiologists, public health experts and urban planners have carried out experiments to tweak the design of blue spaces in cities, measuring the impacts of these changes on human health. In one project in Plymouth, UK, Blue Health worked in communities to rejuvenate run-down public blue spaces. Small-scale changes, like creating a path to the river or adding a small pontoon or seating area, were found to lead to significant improvements in community mood – local residents and visitors reported more positive emotional states and higher life satisfaction after these changes were made.\n",
      "BLOCK: James Grellier, an epidemiologist at the University of Exeter and researcher at Blue Health, believes these results send a \"key message\" to policymakers. But the benefits of blue spaces, he says, largely depend on their quality.\n",
      "\"These spaces have the potential for health, not just the health of the ecosystem but for the people who might visit.\" Unsurpisingly, though, a brown-coloured canal full of old shopping trolleys did not prove to be a good quality blue space. \"Nor is a marina that has been privatised or developed into luxury flats, which shuts people out,\" says Grellier.\n",
      "Larger spaces are also being designed to maximise the benefits of blue health for city-dwellers. On the outskirts of Bristol, south-west England’s most populous city, a 75-acre (30-hectare) \"wave garden\" known as The Wave gives people a rare inland surfing experience.\n",
      "At the human-made lake, \"perfect waves\" roll in one after another. Not just a playground for thrill-seekers, it is a centre for \"surf therapy\", welcoming inner-city children, religious groups, veterans and disabled people – all groups which might feel socially excluded from water-based activities.\n",
      "BLOCK: This year, The Wave collaborated with Open Minds Active, a social impact organisation, to offer a six-week introduction to surfing to Muslim women in the UK – with modest wetsuits, all-female coaches and lessons on a separate side of the surfing lake for men and women.\n",
      "Sarah Ahmed, one of the participants, was surprised that surfing came naturally, despite cultural barriers. \"I didn't know if it would be for me, as I wear a headscarf and long dresses, but it's one of the best things I've ever done.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: While Ahmed lives in a built-up suburb of Bristol, getting out into nature is now more important than ever for her family. \"Lakes were always a no-go growing up, we never thought that you could actually just get in one and start swimming. Now I'm planning more trips so my kids can be exposed to the water.\"\n",
      "As more people immerse themselves in blue spaces, there are of course public safety aspects to consider. Even for the experienced swimmer, water can be dangerous, and judging tides, temperatures and currents tricky. Meanwhile, in the UK, polluted waterways are also a growing problem. A parliamentary committee recently described England’s rivers as a \"chemical cocktail\" of slurry, agricultural run-off and sewage, with only 14% of these rivers meeting good ecological status in 2019.\n",
      "But whether it is diving in or relaxing nearby water, the growing body of research on blue health suggests these blue spaces have a beneficial effect on our minds and bodies.\n",
      "Back in Cornwall, Andy Thornton, the qualified therapist on today's Sea Sanctuary sail, is checking in with the sailors about what tools they could take away from the sail for use in later stressful situations. Thornton, who has worked for Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) for over 30 years, is convinced the charity’s \"broader approach\" to wellbeing with an emphasis on nature-based solutions could be a more affordable and well-rounded alternative to conventional therapy.\n",
      "\"There's something about the colour, the movement, the awe-inspiring size of the sea,” he says. \"You see a marked change while people are on board and it's brilliant to know that people can take that home with them.\"\n",

      "HEADING Why Donald Trump isn't returning to Twitter (for now)\n",
      "BLOCK: Donald Trump loves Twitter. \n",
      "BLOCK: In 2017, he said he wouldn't have become president without it. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"Twitter is a wonderful thing for me, because I get the word outâ¦ I might not be here talking to you right now as president if I didn't have an honest way of getting the word out,\" he said. \n",
      "BLOCK: After Twitter's new owner Elon Musk reversed Mr Trump's permanent suspension, you might have thought the former president would jump at the chance to come back. But so far, he hasn't taken up that offer. \n",
      "BLOCK: Why?\n",
      "BLOCK: Well, only Donald Trump knows the answer to that question for sure.\n",
      "BLOCK: But what we do know is he has a lot of money to lose from tweeting. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"The simplest explanation is the most likely - it's about money,\" says Josh Tucker, professor of politics at New York University (NYU). \n",
      "BLOCK: After Donald Trump was kicked off Twitter, he created his own social media platform called Truth Social - that looks an awful lot like Twitter. \n",
      "BLOCK: To understand the financial bind Donald Trump is in, you have to understand the complex nature of Truth Social's business set up. \n",
      "BLOCK: Last year, the private company that owns Truth Social, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), announced its intention to merge with a shell company trading on the stock exchange called Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC).\n",
      "BLOCK: DWAC is what's known as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (Spac).  Spacs are hyped as a way to speed up the often slow process of taking a private company public. In simple terms, it means merging a company that isn't on a stock exchange with one that is. \n",
      "BLOCK: Both TMTG and DWAC have agreed to merge, though the deal has not yet been completed. But that hasn't stopped investors piling money into DWAC - all of them speculating that the deal will go through. The shell company is currently valued at more than $800m (Â£665m). \n",
      "BLOCK: Considering DWAC would only be acquiring about a quarter of TMTG, Mr Trump's newly merged company would be worth at least $3-4bn, says Michael Ohlrogge, an academic specialising in Spacs. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"He would own the vast majority. He would own probably 70 or 80% of it.\" \n",
      "BLOCK: If it all goes through, it would make this business venture one of the most successful of Donald Trump's career. \n",
      "BLOCK: But the key to keeping stock value high is making sure that the former president stays on Truth Social - and exclusively so. \n",
      "BLOCK: It's hard to see what Truth Social has going for it without Donald Trump. The social media company was created by him. Why should even his supporters use the platform if he is posting elsewhere? \n",
      "BLOCK: Truth Social is already struggling to attract users. Analytics firm Similar Web estimates the platform had eight million site visits in September 2022 - down from 11.5 million in July. For a social media company, that is tiny. \n",
      "BLOCK: Similar Web estimates that Twitter had nine billion site visits in September.\n",
      "BLOCK: If Donald Trump were to stop posting, or do it elsewhere, he could potentially tank the share price of DWAC, wiping hundreds of millions of dollars off its value. \n",
      "BLOCK: So important was Donald Trump's exclusivity with Truth Social to the proposed merger with DWAC, that a legal provision was placed in the agreement. \n",
      "BLOCK: It states that \"President Trump is generally obligated to make any social media post on Truth Social and may not make the same post on another social media site for 6 hours.\" \n",
      "BLOCK: It means that not only could Donald Trump lose a lot of money by using Twitter (by spooking investors) but he could also get sued. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"It's hard to say for sure who would win, but it wouldn't be a completely crazy suit to try to bring,\" says Ohlrogge.\n",
      "BLOCK: It means Donald Trump is now in a quandary. He might want to go back to Twitter. But he is financially - not to mention legally - incentivised not to.\n",
      "BLOCK: There are, however, other factors at play that could lead to him tweeting once more. \n",
      "BLOCK: For starters, DWAC's share price has behaved in very strange ways recently. \n",
      "BLOCK: Rather than it simply being a place where people can de facto invest in Truth Social, people have been purchasing DWA shares as a way of investing in the former president himself. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"It's a meme stock,\" says Michael Klausner, Professor of Law at Stanford University. Meme stocks are companies that have lots of small investors who are online or social media followers, who can drive the share price up and down. \n",
      "BLOCK: Klausner says many who have invested in DWAC are Mr Trump's own supporters. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"They think that Trump's name attached to something is going to be valuable,\" he says. \n",
      "BLOCK: It means DWAC's share price goes up when Donald Trump's fortunes are on the rise, and down when they are taking a turn for the worse. \n",
      "BLOCK: On Monday 7 November, it surged after reports emerged that he planned to run for president in 2024. But nine days later, when he finally confirmed the news in a speech that was criticised as \"low energy\" - the stock price fell.\n",
      "BLOCK: The theory here is that although DWAC is merging with Truth Social, what it's really doing is giving Donald Trump an opportunity to float himself - his personal brand - on the stock exchange. If that is the case, it wouldn't matter so much if Mr Trump were to stop using Truth Social - as the social media company is only a proxy for the man himself. \n",
      "BLOCK: For Josh Tucker from NYU, the situation raises interesting moral questions. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"I have never personally heard of something like this before - that there is a large amount of money tracking what seems to be the political fortunes of a politician.\" \n",
      "BLOCK: He warns that a politician might go on to make decisions based not on what is good for their political aspirations, but their financial ones instead. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"If you're a Republican, you might want your Republican nominee to use the media to the best of their ability,\" he says. \n",
      "BLOCK: Tucker argues that if Republicans were to elect Donald Trump as their presidential nominee, they would expect him to utilise wider social media in campaigning - rather than just limiting himself to one platform for financial gain. \n",
      "BLOCK: But Donald Trump may have anticipated this problem. Buried in the merger agreement there is another provision that allows him to use other social media platforms for \"political messaging\". \n",
      "BLOCK: It may be a \"loophole\", says Klausner, that would allow Trump to tweet without breaching the contract. \n",
      "BLOCK: Not only that, but Mr Trump is only bound by the agreement to post exclusively on Truth Social until July 2023, says Ohlrogge.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"My reading is after that point [legally] he'd be able post directly on Twitter, without posting first on Truth Social,\" he says.\n",
      "BLOCK: There is another reason to think Donald Trump might come back onto Twitter. The merger itself is currently under Federal investigation. \n",
      "BLOCK: The deal could still fall through, at which point Donald Trump's legal commitment to post exclusively on Truth Social would also be ripped up. \n",
      "BLOCK: Mr Trump might lose money, but it would open the door still wider for a Twitter return. \n",
      "BLOCK: As with many of Mr Trump's financial affairs, it's complicated. And Donald Trump is not a person who is easy to predict. \n",
      "BLOCK: But what we do know is that were he to stick with Truth Social exclusively, and complete the Spac merger, he would likely earn a small fortune. \n",
      "BLOCK: It's hard to see how that's not a major factor in his thinking. Will that calculation change as we get closer to an election? \n",
      "BLOCK: It may well do. But for now, Mr Trump says he's staying put. \n",

      "BLOCK: Scott said she \"couldn't believe\" she had been crowned Queen of the Jungle.\n",
      "BLOCK: Hancock's participation in the show has been controversial and led to him having the Tory whip suspended.\n",
      "BLOCK: Asked by hosts Ant and Dec why he took part, Hancock said: \"I wanted to show what I'm like as a person.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"Lots of people come to me with pre-conceived ideas for obvious reasons, and I just wanted to be myself,\" he continued.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"But I also believe that for politicians as a whole, we don't come across as human enough. And this is probably the most extreme way of showing who you are.\"\n",

      "BLOCK: Figures from ITV show 47% of public votes went to Scott, 31% to Warner and 22% to Hancock. After Hancock was eliminated, Scott won with 58% to Warner's 42%.\n",
      "BLOCK: However, Hancock's triumph in reaching the final did not impress some fellow politicians. Business Secretary Grant Shapps said Hancock's political career was \"pretty much done\" after appearing on the show.\n",
      "BLOCK: He said on Times Radio: \"I do think... that his true position should have been in Parliament this last few weeks, and serving his constituents.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"You know, it's often said that... politics is showbusiness for ugly people. He should be with us uglies back in the House rather than the jungle down under.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Hancock took part in 10 Bushtucker trials during his time in the jungle, five of which were the result of a public vote.\n",
      "BLOCK: Since last week, the public have been voting to keep their favourite campmates in the jungle, rather than to evict their least favourites. \n",
      "BLOCK: During his exit interview, Hancock admitted he was nervous about taking part in the series, adding that he had expected the tough questions he was asked by other campmates.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"Some of those grillings were really enjoyable and a release, because I could say exactly what I thought, and some were very emotional about some parts of my past that everybody knows about,\" he said.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"We had really grown-up conversations about it, and there were strong feelings but there wasn't any aggro, they were discussions.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: He concluded: \"I know it was controversial, me coming in here... but we've all got lots of sides to our personalities.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: After his interview, Hancock was seen being reunited with his partner Gina Coladangelo, who he was caught kissing on CCTV in 2021 - events which ultimately led to his resignation as health secretary.\n",
      "BLOCK: Social distancing guidelines, which Hancock had helped devise, were in place at the time they were pictured kissing. He faced a barrage of criticism when the footage was released by the Sun.\n",
      "BLOCK: Hancock's participation in the series was criticised by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who said Hancock should not be away from his constituents while Parliament is sitting.\n",
      "BLOCK: The 44-year-old was also criticised by Conservative colleagues and opposition MPs, as well as his local Conservative association who said they were \"disappointed\" and accused Hancock of a \"serious error of judgement\". \n",
      "BLOCK: Soon after the MP's arrival in the camp on 9 November, a banner was flown over it bearing a message from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group.\n",
      "BLOCK: But Hancock, who said he entered the jungle to raise awareness of his dyslexia campaign, survived all the public-voted evictions during his time on the show.\n",
      "BLOCK: Hancock previously said he would donate some of his fee for taking part in the series - reported to be Â£400,000 - to a hospice in his constituency and dyslexia charities.\n",

      "HEADING The birth pangs of the Grand Theft Auto franchise\n",
      "BLOCK: The Grand Theft Auto franchise has been a phenomenal success since it was first launched exactly 25 years ago, making billions of dollars for its American owner Take-Two Interactive.\n",
      "BLOCK: So it may come as a surprise to learn that its creators, Dundee-based DMA Design, were far from confident about GTA's prospects as they struggled with creative and technical problems during its development in the 1990s.\n",
      "BLOCK: Colin Macdonald, who joined DMA a few months before the launch of the action-adventure video game in 1997, explains: \"In mid-development, there was an informal staff survey on which of the seven titles they were working on would be the most successful and least successful. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"The one voted most likely not to succeed was Grand Theft Auto.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"That's because, mid-development, the direction of the game wasn't clear. It was also quite buggy - you couldn't play it for more than a couple of minutes without it crashing, so certainly at grassroots level there wasn't a lot of confidence in it.\" \n",
      "BLOCK: Colin, who was to become the producer of GTA 2 and later Channel 4's first games commissioning editor, says the atmosphere at DMA was \"quite relaxed\" by the time he joined.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"GTA went through a lot of different iterations and was quite a troubled development, and wasn't really regarded well for most of the time it was in production.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"By the time I joined it was pretty much done and the team was actually quite happy because they had kind of got shot of it.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"They were looking forward to sitting back, planning a sequel properly, redoing the things that they weren't happy with, and just looking forward to getting stuck into iterating on it and seeing where else they could take it.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Fans of GTA may also be surprised to learn that the franchise actually stemmed from a technology experiment - with a dinosaur as its central character.\n",
      "BLOCK: Colin explains: \"One of the original founding programmers at DMA, Mike Dailly, was basically doing a tech experiment as a way of showing how buildings could look in 3D from top down with a little bit of perspective.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"So he basically came up with a dinosaur game. You had this city that moved around in some form of 3D, but you were a dinosaur roaming around and destroying the buildings. That was what Grand Theft Auto started as.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"He then added in little cars driving around, just to bring the city to life. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"Someone had the bright idea to see what it would be like driving one of the cars rather than controlling the dinosaur and suddenly it changed into a car game, rather than a dinosaur game. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"It was called Race 'n' Chase for a good while. And then someone realised, 'oh, actually we'll try letting the player get out of the car and run around and jump in and out of other cars'. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"It was really only at that point it morphed into Grand Theft Auto.\" \n",
      "BLOCK: Overhauling the original idea brought its own problems, according to Colin.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"When you are changing a game so fundamentally like that, all sorts of problems get introduced.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"You have developed code that is no longer doing what it was originally intended to do. So there's all sorts of problems - the game gets very buggy and crashes a lot, and the team are feeling like the whole process is completely changing and they are not doing what they originally set out to do. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"But actually, this process of evolving and iterating is what made it feel so dynamic. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"So although it was a very frustrating process for the team, it meant they could see what really worked, iterate on it and give the game a new direction.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"They also had time to polish it, so they started doing things like adding skid marks and shadows and nice sound effects and the radio stations - all of those things that really brought the world to life.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Colin says that although GTA only came together in its final six months of development, there were signs that it could connect with a wide audience.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"The team were playing it in their own lunchtimes, which is always a rare thing. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"After you spend a couple of years developing something, you are usually sick to the back teeth of seeing it - the last thing you want to do is see it again in your spare time.\" \n",
      "BLOCK: Colin says the sequel he produced involved making technical changes to make the game more \"structurally sound\" and moving the game from being set in the contemporary world. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"We wanted to make it feel a little bit more futuristic. That gave us more creative licence with the vehicles, with the weapons, with the types of environments you would see. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"In hindsight, that probably hasn't resonated with audiences as well as the contemporary vehicles and cities. Most of the Grand Theft Auto games have gone back to being set more or less in the present day.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Colin adds that despite the franchise's birth pangs, there was a sense within the original team that they were on to something.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"We knew we had something special - the fact that the team were playing it in their own time is a really strong indicator of that - but there are countless games that come out every year that are creatively and technically brilliant but just don't sell particularly well, for whatever reason. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"Most people don't hear about them - they are not quite capturing the zeitgeist of the moment - and Grand Theft Auto could easily have been another one of those.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"It's been quite a surprise to see it still do so well a quarter of a century later.\"\n",

      "BLOCK: A photo of one of the researchers lying alongside a femur, or thigh bone, to illustrate the animal's great size was printed in newspapers around the world.\n",
      "BLOCK: The BBC was lucky enough to be at the dig, and later produced a film with Sir David Attenborough called, appropriately, Attenborough And The Giant Dinosaur.\n",
      "BLOCK: MEF is also going to loan the actual femur, which is sure to make a remarkable selfie moment for NHM visitors.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"That single leg bone measures 2.4m and weighs over 500 kilos,\" said Ms Marron. \"We'll also have a full set of arm bones.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"It'll be the first time that those fossils and Patagotitan will be on display in Europe. MEF are being incredibly generous. They're just really keen to showcase their science to the world and we're so excited we're the venue that they want to do that with.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: The cast will be accompanied by interactive exhibits that explain the life story of the exceptionally large Cretaceous sauropods known collectively as the titanosaurs.\n",
      "BLOCK: Animals like Patagotitan and another creature called Argentinosaurus were right up there. Who exactly was the biggest of them all is difficult to say. In part that's because not all the bones for some of these dinosaurs have been found, making estimates of their true size a little uncertain.\n",
      "BLOCK: Scientists don't know why the titanosaurs were so big, but have a good idea as to how they developed their immense bulk. \n",
      "BLOCK: This probably had something to do with the relatively poor quality plant food available to them, which required a large digestive system to get the most out of it.\n",
      "BLOCK: Essentially, they were giant fermentation tanks on sturdy legs.\n",

      "HEADING Ebola fears see Uganda close schools early for Christmas\n",
      "BLOCK: It might seem like Christmas is coming early for students in Uganda as millions of them head home early for the school holidays on Friday. Yet the decision to close schools nationwide two weeks before the end of term has been taken to curb the spread of Ebola, as the country continues to battle one of its worst outbreaks.\n",
      "BLOCK: It is also at odds with the government's official stance that everything is under control. \n",
      "BLOCK: In the past two months 55 people have died with the virus - and there were 22 probable Ebola deaths before the outbreak was officially declared on 20 September.\n",
      "BLOCK: Some experts have expressed reservations about the school shutdowns, arguing that keeping pupils contained for another two weeks would be a better way to halt the spread of the deadly disease, given the incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. \n",
      "BLOCK: Ebola is a viral infection that is spread through the bodily fluids of a patient.\n",
      "BLOCK: Many of the children who attend boarding schools will be travelling long distances across the country.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"They are going to be packed in buses, minibuses and private cars providing maximum opportunity for people to mix in very close contact,\" public health expert Dr Olive Kobusingye, a senior research fellow at Makerere University School and the University of South Africa, told the BBC.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"It's the last thing Uganda needs now.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: But it is not a decision taken lightly - given that at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Uganda imposed the longest school closure globally, lasting 22 months.\n",
      "BLOCK: Education Minister Janet Museveni, who is also the wife of Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, made the announcement earlier this month following 23 cases across five schools in Kampala - which led to the death of eight students.\n",
      "BLOCK: The infections in the capital were linked to a man who had travelled to there from the western Mubende district, the epicentre of the outbreak.\n",
      "BLOCK: The fear is schools could now act as a reservoir - something authorities want to avoid in urban areas.\n",
      "BLOCK: Schools had already put in place strict anti-Ebola measures - many already used for Covid - including temperature screening, regular handwashing and disinfecting surfaces. \n",
      "BLOCK: Visits by parents and guardians were then banned as the last term of the year drew to a close and final-year students prepared for exams.\n",
      "BLOCK: For Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng, organising the end-of-term travel for students to and from Mubende and Kassanda, another of the worst-affected districts, has been of paramount importance.\n",
      "BLOCK: Both of these areas are still under lockdown, meaning residents cannot leave, and entry is restricted unless passing through on the main highway.\n",
      "BLOCK: Children will be dropped off at designated points from where they will then board buses provided by the government and international organisations supporting the Ebola response. \n",
      "BLOCK: These buses will take them to assigned stops in their home areas where parents can pick them up. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"This is to ensure the parents don't go into the two districts and the learners coming out of boarding schools don't go into communities\" in the outbreak epicentre, Dr Aceng told the BBC.\n",
      "BLOCK: Pupils returning to Mubende and Kassanda must first go to Kampala, where they will be put on buses and taken to a main meeting point within their home district. \n",
      "BLOCK: They will be fully briefed beforehand on how to protect themselves.\n",
      "BLOCK: Uganda has dealt with multiple outbreaks of Ebola over the past 22 years, but the current one is by far the most widespread, having been reported in nine districts, mostly in the central regions.\n",
      "BLOCK: Like four previous epidemics, this one is of the Sudan strain, for which there is no approved vaccine or treatment, unlike the more common Zaire strain responsible for the largest ever Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n",
      "BLOCK: The government has said that trials for three vaccines will begin in the coming weeks, though details are scant about how and on whom they will be carried out.\n",
      "BLOCK: There has been good news from Kagadi and Bunyangabu districts, where 42 days have passed without a new infection - double the incubation period.\n",
      "BLOCK: Kyegegwa district has also gone for a couple of weeks without a new case, giving the response teams hope that the control measures are working.\n",
      "BLOCK: But the challenge continues to be people who have been identified as contacts of confirmed cases who then travel without notifying health workers.\n",
      "BLOCK: The outbreaks in Jinja and Masaka were triggered by two infected people who travelled separately out of Kampala. \n",
      "BLOCK: Critics feel this is an indication that the health ministry does not have the capacity to deal with containment - and worry about the thoroughness of the contact tracing.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I think the data that has been put out there is confirmed data, but I do not believe it's exhaustive,\" ActionAid's Xavier Ejoyi told the BBC.\n",
      "BLOCK: In response, the health minister acknowledged that she could not say their quarantine or identification of cases was \"100% watertight\", but expressed confidence that surveillance teams could quickly identify any cases that had been missed.\n",
      "BLOCK: Lt Col Dr Henry Bosa, the country's Ebola incident commander agreed, telling the BBC: \"If we were hiding any data, the evidence would be out - we'd be seeing people dying en masse.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: However, he conceded that listing contacts in urban settings was complex and speed was important.\n",
      "BLOCK: Pupils are due to go back to class for the new school year in January.\n",
      "BLOCK: The health ministry estimates that the outbreak could end in February or March - though Dr Aceng had a stark warning that this would only be the case if people obeyed prevention measures.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"The end of this epidemic much depends on the communities,\" she said.\n",

      "BLOCK: On Christmas Day 2017, a traffic police officer's life began slowly to unravel after he was injured during a pursuit. Two years later he underwent surgery and was told he could no longer do the job he loved. His mental health took a nosedive but he found solace in his long-time hobby - photography.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"As a traffic officer I saw things no-one should see,\" Det Sgt Colin Shead says.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"Now I see things I want everyone to see.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Here, he speaks candidly about his mental health, and shares some of the images that have helped him cope. \n",
      "BLOCK: The 51-year-old officer has clocked up more than 30 years on the force, joining Essex Police's roads policing unit (RPU) in 2010.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I'd always wanted to do traffic work, because I wanted to protect people from harm on the roads,\" he says.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"When you start, there's the great thrill and excitement of flying around all over the place - then you get the serious side - and the fatalities.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"You're the first at the scene when someone's been killed - you see that first-hand and it takes its toll.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: After his knee was injured in 2017, he kept working, afraid he might lose the job he loved. \n",
      "BLOCK: But after surgery in March 2019 he was told he could no longer be operational - he would have to take a desk job.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"In June that year, everything came to a head. It was breaking point,\" he says.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"Everything came out - everything I had held inside.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Det Sgt Shead was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n",
      "BLOCK: His PTSD was the result of a combination of factors - losing his role in roads policing and the traumatic things he had witnessed and experienced on that job, he says.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I would get intrusive thoughts, and flashbacks.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"There was a particular scene from a fatal accident where a teenage boy came off his motorbike, hit a tree and he died.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"The boy's father lived nearby and came running over - he fell to his knees in front of me - and then he just picked up his son's crash helmet and threw it away.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: The scene would \"play over and over again in my head\", he recalls.\n",
      "BLOCK: He credits his friend and mentor, wildlife photographer Russell Savory, with \"saving\" him.\n",
      "BLOCK: Photography and filming became \"like a lifeline\".                          \n",
      "BLOCK: \"When you're out there, it's a complete focus, you concentrate on the subject matter - you can spend four or six hours on a subject for just one minute of film.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Photography has become more important as the years have gone on.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"There is no life outside of your lens. There isn't. Your focus is on what you are looking at or looking for.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: The death of his grandfather in 2016 was one of a number of tipping points he had been pushing to the back of his mind.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I was with him in hospital when he died.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I was in my uniform - I saw my uniform as something that protected people - but it couldn't protect him.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I lost faith in my uniform - it was like a wake-up call that we're not superheroes.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Looking back, Det Sgt Shead says his illness was almost inevitable.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I remember back in 2018 hearing about a fatal [accident] on the A12, and just thinking, 'please, not another one'.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I had to have my uniform burned after attending. I couldn't get the stench of death - from the scene - out of it.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I thought I'd put this to bed, but it was one after another, after another, it was becoming endless.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I became aware of my own mortality - driving at high speeds.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Taking pictures is the complete opposite, he says.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"It's about sitting and waiting for things - nothing but you and the elements and nature.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"No distraction. Nothing.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Det Sgt Shead is far from alone as an officer with PTSD.\n",
      "BLOCK: The Police Federation - which represents more than 130,000 rank and file officers in the UK - says the numbers suffering with mental health conditions have soared.   \n",
      "BLOCK: Figures published last month show 13,263 officers were absent due to stress, depression, anxiety, or PTSD in the past financial year, compared with 8,450 the year before - an increase of 57%. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"One in five officers have PTSD, and an overwhelming majority have experienced a traumatic incident at some point during their career which undoubtedly has a significant impact on their mental health,\" the federation's head of wellbeing, Sue Honeywill, says.\n",
      "BLOCK: The numbers are likely to be higher as the figures do not include civilian police staff such as crime scene investigators.\n",
      "BLOCK: Essex Police says providing support to its staff is \"a responsibility we take very seriously\".\n",
      "BLOCK: Its Trauma Risk Management (TRiM) practitioners provide help to officers and staff following a traumatic event and identify those who may be at risk.\n",
      "BLOCK: Managers, the force says, are trained to identify when an officer or staff member may need help and an occupational health team and employee assistance programme give access to support, counselling and other services.\n",
      "BLOCK: Officers and staff returning to work following a period of absence are supported through recuperative duties and ensuring reasonable adjustments are in place, so their working environment reflects their needs.\n",
      "BLOCK: Figures for Essex Police at the end of March this year show 180 staff were on recuperative duties and 211 on adjusted roles.\n",
      "BLOCK: After surgery in 2019 Det Sgt Shead had some time off.\n",
      "BLOCK: It gave him, he says, \"time to reflect, to stop and think and unwind\".\n",
      "BLOCK: \"The trigger came during this time,\" he says.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"On 15 June 2019, I just found myself shaking - holding onto the bathroom sink, looking in the mirror and thinking, 'this isn't right'.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Essex Police's counselling and wellbeing team stepped in, and he was diagnosed with PTSD.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I went through a period of counselling, therapy and medication - it was really painful for me.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: He had six months off work.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I was told it was classic PTSD and in a way it was a relief having it labelled.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I was burning myself out, and I hadn't realised.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: To be told he could no longer function as an operational roads policing officer was a shock.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"My world collapsed,\" he says. \"I didn't join to be behind a desk. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"This has taken what I thought was my lifetime career, away from me.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"My mind says that at the drop of a hat I'd do [roads policing] again, but, being honest, enough is enough.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: For the past three years he has had a desk-based position working with the case investigation team dealing with anything from road rage to theft.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I do enjoy what I do. I learnt a lot in those six months off - that you have to look after yourself, or you're no good to anyone.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I think I'm now honest with myself.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Det Sgt Shead appealed against restrictions placed upon him by the force's medical advisor that took him off operational work. \n",
      "BLOCK: He was successful and went on to pass his job-related fitness test.\n",
      "BLOCK: In September this year he was deployed to Operation London Bridge, on duty as the Queen's coffin was taken from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"Knowing I could go back out there if I wanted to, has made a huge difference,\" he says.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"But I'm happy - genuinely happy - and mentally, I'm good.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Getting out and about with his camera has played a large part in that.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"If you're prepared to wait, then eventually everything will fall into place when it comes to wildlife. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"It may take a few years but you'll get there eventually.\"\n",
      "BLOCK: Speaking about one of his photographs of the sun rising over the sea at Dovercourt, taken in April, he says: \"One thing Russell [Savory] taught me is that if you want to get that shot, you have to get up early. \n",
      "BLOCK: \"Some days I'm up at 03:00 to photograph the sunrise, or take pictures of beavers. \n",

      "BLOCK: Amateur historian Fiona Kay spent three years scouring and scanning thousands of pictures from a library archive covering the history of Newcastle and North East England. Ahead of a book festival talk on her findings, she has shared some of her favourite images with the BBC.\n",
      "BLOCK: Deep in the bowels of Newcastle's City Library is a cold storage room brimming with boxes. \n",
      "BLOCK: Some contain negatives on plastic film, others large glass plates dating back to the mid-1800s when photography was in its infancy.\n",
      "BLOCK: All were of interest to Fiona Kay, who works in admin for a company by day and is a keen historian by night (well, at the weekends).\n",

      "BLOCK: Before the coronavirus pandemic curtailed her efforts in 2020, Ms Kay had scanned some 5,000 pictures, properly cataloguing many of them for the first time.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"There is just so much history squirrelled away that does not see the light of day,\" Ms Kay from Cramlington said.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"I was especially interested in the social history, seeing the people and what they were wearing and doing, looking at the cars and carriages, the shops and how they have changed.\"\n",

      "BLOCK: \"It's both daunting and exciting,\" Ms Kay said.\n",

      "BLOCK: \"In those days the river was lined with working factories, wharves and warehouses and the industries caused smog to hang in the air over the city,\" Ms Kay said.\n",
      "BLOCK: Ms Kay's second picture shows a view of Castle Garth and Dog Leap Stairs also taken in about 1890.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"Although there was a certain Dickensian charm about it, the living conditions within these old buildings were often squalid and unsanitary and many folks simply did not have the money to move out from them,\" she said.\n",
      "BLOCK: Ms Kay said she especially liked finding pictures of people, such as the above image showing a line of \"hard-up folks\" waiting for free food from the St Ann's soup kitchen in 1912.\n",
      "BLOCK: Visitors to Eldon Square today will find a busy shopping area, but in 1933 it was still surrounded by Georgian houses.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"It was an area of tranquil calm in the city centre,\" Ms Kay said.\n",
      "BLOCK: Northumberland Street, as seen in the above picture in 1925, formed the \"shopping heartland\" of Newcastle along with Grainger Street, Ms Kay said.\n",
      "BLOCK: The Bigg Market is perhaps best known now for its varied bars and nightlife, but in 1930 it was a popular market.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"This area always seemed to be bustling with small crowds, not only visiting its shops or as visitors to events held at the old town hall, but they were also drawn to the market stalls, notably Risi's and Mark Toney's ice creams,\" Ms Kay said.\n",
      "BLOCK: Ms Kay said she liked pictures showing people going about their business, as seen in the above picture of Sandhill in about 1895.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"In the foreground are the carriers horses, carts and shelters but it was a stiff old climb for the hand barrow carters who transported goods from Quayside to Toon,\" she said.\n",
      "BLOCK: The above picture showed Newcastle advancing into the modern age in the 1950s, Ms Kay said, with Hadrian grocery shop in Wallsend offering the revolutionary idea of self-service.\n",
      "BLOCK: \"The concept of a self-service shop was still new to the British public who were used to asking at a counter and being served with goods they wished to purchase,\" Ms Kay said.\n",
