0,Women’s Super League: talking points from the weekend’s action,The Guardian,"Suzanne Wrack, Sophie Downey and Sarah Rendell",2022-11-21,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/21/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action,"Arsenal’s winning run was ended in dramatic style at the Emirates while Brighton and Liverpool also produced a thrillerManchester United’s second win against one of Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City, and first away win against any of the traditional top three, was significant. The 3-2 defeat of Arsenal at the Emirates spoke to a real shift in the resilience of Marc Skinner’s side. Having taken the lead, United’s collapse early in the second half, conceding twice, looked to be following a familiar pattern. Instead, in front of an impressive away end, United roared back to equalise and then win it in injury time. Skinner called it a full Manchester United performance. “Our job is to bring the women under that same banner of: we might go down but we’re never beaten,” he said. They were helped by some poor defending for Katie Zelem’s lethal set-pieces, which provided goals two and three, but there is little doubt that United, after a bruising 3-1 defeat to Chelsea, are serious contenders. SWWhat a way to get your first #BarclaysWSL goal!@ArsenalWFC 🙌 pic.twitter.com/wgHYEVHZbsPerhaps the biggest winners following Manchester United’s 3-2 defeat of Arsenal were Chelsea. Having beaten United 3-1 before the international break, the Blues pounced on the opportunity to go top of the table, albeit with an extra game played, with a 3-0 home win over Tottenham. Emma Hayes returned to the touchline following her emergency hysterectomy, but the team had gone unbeaten in her absence and, in many ways, transition in and out had been seamless. “There is often this sense that coaching has to be done from coaches to players,” she mused after. “Instead I want players to be coaches on the pitch. So Sam Kerr said to me that when she scored against Manchester United the other day – when her touch had been all over the place in maybe three or four subsequent moves –just before that Guro [Reiten] had told her ‘Sam, the next time the ball comes, turn and shoot.’ It just made me feel so confident.” SWStill thinking about this strike from @erincuthbert_ 🤩#BarclaysWSL @ChelseaFCW pic.twitter.com/gXLsKiRmatIf you are looking for pure drama, a Brighton game is the place to be these days. A fortnight ago, they had clung on to victory in a nine-goal thriller. On Sunday, they surrendered a lead once more, leaving interim manager, Amy Merricks, lamenting her side’s tendency to concede. It was deja-vu as the Seagulls found themselves 3-1 up at the break. A capitulation followed, however, as Liverpool produced an inspired comeback. Despite a tough run of form, Matt Beard’s side have shown character and they took their opportunities with Shanice van de Sanden as the catalyst. The substitute pulled one back before providing the assist for a dramatic equaliser. Rachel Furness was the player of the hour, bravely diving in with her head – as she so often does – at a cross in the 91st minute to send her team home with a valuable point. SDLiverpool equalise in extra-time 👀 What a goal from @RachelFurness10 🚀 #BarclaysWSL @LiverpoolFCW pic.twitter.com/Sy1lFLwvnnWhen your luck is out in football, it really is out. An 87th-minute winner from West Ham’s Izzy Atkinson – her first goal for the club – struck a dagger through Leicester hearts. Having what looked an equaliser disallowed minutes later only added to the pain. The Foxes, propping up the table, produced a solid performance on Sunday against an out-of-sorts West Ham. For the most part, they were brave and compact, controlling possession and tenacious with it. Their inability to convert chances, however, made them pay once more. Before the game, Willie Kirk’s side had the lowest shot conversion rate in the league at 3.5% and that problem was highlighted in this encounter: they created 17 shots to West Ham’s eight but only managed three on target. Kirk was keen to emphasise the positives post-match but he will know how valuable even a point would have been. With Chelsea next things do not get any easier for this Leicester side as they try to find a way to turn their fortunes around. SDSign up to Moving the GoalpostsInformative, passionate, entertaining.

On Sunday, at Villa Park, they took the lead in the seventh minute but once again defensive errors let them down and they ended up losing 3-1. It went wrong late in the first half with Rachel Daly being left unmarked to head in the equaliser. True, it was a superb header but she had far too much room to execute it. Daly then made it 2-1 from a corner and it could even have been 3-1 early in the second half but Kirsty Hanson missed a glorious oppotunity. The Reading goalkeeper, Jacqueline Burns, was then sent off for a challenge on Daly and the England international completed her hat-trick from the spot. Reading have conceded 17 goals in seven games; that ratio needs to improve if they are to avoid a relegation scrap. SRThe composure from @izzyatkinson_ 🧊#BarclaysWSL @westhamwomen pic.twitter.com/YUY3MyYNaeStriker Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw has become the linchpin of Manchester City’s team this season and scored another vital goal at the weekend, this one giving her side a 2-1 win at Everton. The goal, coming in the 49th minute from a rebound, was her eighth in the league this season and handed City their fifth consecutive WSL victory, ensuring they keep the pressure up on the top three. Shaw set up the other goal for her side but the City manager, Gareth Taylor, was at pains to point out her overall contribution. “She does so much more than score goals, the way she takes the hits as well as giving the hits out,” he told the BBC. “She’s also very strong and she’s looking a lot fitter. She’s found a rhythm now in knowing she’s the focal point of the team.” SR",[]
1,Moving the Goalposts | ‘We want to keep dreaming’ – the rise and rise of Roma Women,The Guardian,Sophie Downey,2022-12-07,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/07/we-want-to-keep-dreaming-the-rise-and-rise-of-roma-women,"Club has soared since acquiring the Serie A licence from Res Roma in 2018 – and is now targeting European successWelcome to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian’s free women’s football newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below:“Un Pari Che Sa Di Gloria” read the headline of il Romanista a fortnight ago: “A draw which has the taste of glory”. Champions League debutants Roma had just held Wolfsburg, one of the European greats, to a draw at home. It was a result that put progression into the knockout stages firmly in the Giallorosse’s grasp, sending a signal around the continent that there is very much a new kid in town.Since acquiring the Serie A licence from Res Roma in 2018, Roma have made solid progress. Last season – Alessandro Spugna’s first in charge – they finished second and qualified for Europe for the first time. The ambition to be among the European elite is clear and their form has backed it up. Unbeaten in 15, they have leapt to the top of Serie A, leading Juventus by a comfortable six-point margin. They won the Coppa Italia in 2021 and that was followed by the Supercoppa Italia last month.“We are a very ambitious club, and we want to try to win as many titles as possible,” Spugna tells Moving the Goalposts. “We know that to do this we need to improve. We already managed to get one trophy this season, the Super Cup, to which we attached a great importance. We are doing very well in the Italian league … as far as the Champions League is concerned, this is a dream. We want to keep dreaming. It’s very hard but it allows you to get better because you have to measure yourself against very big teams.”Much of his side’s success has been down to the personnel acquired. The Giallorosse are an eclectic mix, blending some of Italy’s best with stars from abroad. The striker Valentina Giacinti arrived from Milan in the summer and has already made an impact. Rome has been home to Brazil’s centurion, Andressa, since 2019 while the experienced Austrian defender, Carina Wenninger, arrived on loan in the summer.“There has been great work since the foundation of this club,” Spugna says. “Every year, we’ve been adding bits. This is a club made up of ambitious people with a great desire to improve.”“The level has increased in Italy thanks to the advent of professional women’s teams. In the last two years, big international players landed in the Italian league and we are one of the clubs who have invested a lot in important players. The league continues to grow, but of course to get to the level of Lyon, Wolfsburg, Barcelona, Chelsea … it will still take time because they are ahead of us. We are trying to bridge this gap and I believe we are on the right track.”As the women’s game continues to develop, a historic club such as Roma having a notable women’s side is key. They are a team that like to play on the front foot, but their manager is pragmatic about his side’s approach: “I like a team that dominates teams,” he says. “Domestically, we are managing to do this because we have a lot of quality … that’s what we are also trying to do in the Champions League. But of course, at this level, which is much higher, it’s not always possible and sometimes you have to defend.”They are unbeaten in Europe this season, winning five of their seven matches. The highlight was that confidence-inducing draw with Wolfsburg, who they meet again on Thursday evening. “It meant a lot to us,” reflects Spugna. “Not only because of the final score, but because of the performance. We were brave on the pitch. We not only defended the result, but we tried to win the game.”The pride Spugna feels is evident. However, he is not one to rest on his laurels with a clear focus to push Roma to the next level. “I landed in this big club and city, living a dream,” he says. “But now I’m here, I’m very happy and very proud. I’m happy that we’re doing good work, which is the most important thing. You need to keep doing this because in football, you need to forget what you did yesterday, and you need to focus on the future.”All change in Canada Legends of the game Christine Sinclair and Diane Matheson have announced the formation of a first professional domestic league in Canada. Project 8, co-founded by Matheson alongside Thomas Gilbert, intend for its inaugural campaign to start in 2025. It will be composed of eight teams, spanning the country. Vancouver Whitecaps FC and Calgary Foothills Soccer Club have been revealed as the first two founding members.Frappart’s debut History was written last week as France’s Stéphanie Frappart became the first woman to referee at a men’s World Cup. She was the official in the centre of the action as Germany took on Costa Rica in the group stages.

More than 30,000 supporters turned out at Old Trafford to enjoy their side’s thumping win over Aston Villa. All eyes will be on Manchester again next weekend. Over 40,000 tickets have been sold for the highly anticipated Manchester derby at the Etihad. With both sides in good form and mounting a title chase, could it be a significant game for the direction of the WSL?The Theatre of Dreams has seen many a special goal in its time. Another was added to the list on Saturday as Ona Batlle brought the flair to Old Trafford in Manchester United’s 5-0 victory. Her thunderous effort from close range went in off the crossbar, giving Hannah Hampton no chance in the Aston Villa goal.“One thing that is clear is that you have to have some time off in football. That is important for any job, even if you love your job and it’s your passion and it’s what you want to do … it’s a deeply human thing where you need to switch off and reconnect …that is important in any workplace, and we need to acknowledge that” – Arsenal’s Jonas Eidevall on the importance of giving his players time off.Got a question for our writers – or want to suggest a topic to cover?

2,Leicester’s Ashleigh Plumptre: ‘I love everything about being in Nigeria’,The Guardian,Ella Braidwood,2022-11-17,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/17/leicester-ashleigh-plumptre-nigeria,"The defender on playing for the club in her heart and learning of her heritage through representing the country of her grandfatherRight to her core, Ashleigh Plumptre is a Leicester City player. Growing up in Melton Mowbray, about a 30 minutes’ drive from the city, the 24-year-old defender played for the club’s centre of excellence from the age of eight to 14, having started playing a few years earlier for a local girls’ side.“I was one of those kids that just always wanted to be active,” Plumptre says. She recalls getting home from school, dropping off her bags before playing football outside until “my mum would say I had to be home for dinner”.As a teenager she temporarily left her hometown club, where she would later sign her first professional contract. As Leicester’s senior women were relegated from the third tier in 2013, Plumptre was tempted by Birmingham, a founding member of the Women’s Super League, where she joined their under-17 squad. After that followed a brief period at Derby, before she joined Notts County, who were then a WSL side.In 2016, Plumptre moved to the US on a scholarship at the University of Southern California, where she majored in human biology. Her college side won the National Championship that year and were invited to the White House. Of that time, she says: “It influenced so many things in my life, and not just football, I found out more about myself, what I’m passionate about.”But her ambitions never strayed far from returning to Leicester. By this point, the club had risen through the ranks to the Championship. After graduating in 2019 and despite interest from a few WSL sides, Plumptre was set on Leicester. Her father, also her agent, approached the club directly. The deal she signed has since extended it until at least next June.“[It] meant a lot to me to sign for Leicester because it was the club I’ve always supported and I grew up here,” she says. “I felt valued here, and I felt like I had a purpose here in trying to bring success to the club.”After joining, Plumptre played a key role in securing Leicester’s promotion to the WSL for the 2021-22 season. Money likely helped, too: her team went fully professional in August 2020, after it was bought by King Power. “All the investment … it showed in the players that we brought in, and [promotion] was everybody’s mindset from the beginning,” she says.Football, though, is far more than just a sport to Plumptre. “I have to have a purpose in it,” she says. “I struggle just to play it.” Case in point: she is an ambassador for Menphys, a local charity supporting young people with disabilities, which has supported her brother, who is autistic. (Plumptre has two younger brothers and a sister, all half-siblings.)It was also in this mindset that, during the coronavirus lockdowns, Plumptre began thinking more about her Nigerian heritage: her paternal grandfather was born in Lagos.Soon, she was talking to her 12-year-old sister about it. “Even though we have the same dad, we both have a Nigerian dad and a white mum, she looks a little different to me and has experienced things in school that I never had,” she says. “Most people just assume that I’m white. I identify as being mixed heritage. But my sister … she identifies as being black.”“I felt a bit helpless in that,” she says of learning about her sister’s experiences. Plumptre had played for England’s youth squads, including at Under-23 level but this year switched her allegiance to Nigeria, making her official debut in February. She says: “That’s where I’m like: ‘OK, Nigeria would be good for me to do because then I can experience the culture more, I can come back and teach her about our heritage.’ That was the trigger for me.”Sign up to Moving the GoalpostsInformative, passionate, entertaining. Sign up to our weekly round-up of women’s football now.Having not visited Nigeria until last year, Plumptre has embraced playing for the west African country. “I love the culture, I honestly love everything about being in Nigeria,” she says. She has also “realised how lucky I’ve been to just have been born in this country, the opportunities that I’ve been blessed with”. She adds: “My Nigerian teammates, for example, they’ve worked so hard but sometimes they don’t get the same opportunities based upon the teams that they’re playing in, the lack of exposure that they have. It’s a privilege to play with them.” Next year, she hopes to make the squad to represent Nigeria at the World Cup.Back at Leicester, Plumptre faces a turbulent season ahead. With her side having lost their first seven matches, a relegation battle looks likely. But after fighting off the drop last season, she’s hopeful. “We know how it feels and we know how to get out of it so ultimately everybody is pretty much keeping the faith,” she says. “We know we can get results.”What else does she want to achieve? “I just want to have an impact by being myself, I don’t really know what that looks like yet,” she says. “I want to help people, that’s all.”Get to know the players in England’s top flight better with our WSL player in focus series.

3,Man City win keeps pressure on WSL top three,BBC News,,2022-12-04,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63771047,"Last updated on 4 December 20224 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballManchester City kept up the pressure on the top three in the Women's Super League with a comfortable home win over Brighton.All three goals for the hosts came inside the first 26 minutes as Gareth Taylor's fourth-placed side made a blistering start at the Academy Stadium.City were imperious in the first half with England forward Chloe Kelly at the heart of everything.Kelly's in-swinging corner led to the opening goal as Brighton goalkeeper Megan Walsh fumbled a regulation take and the ball went in off Seagulls' midfielder Veatriki Sarri in the 11th minute.Julie Blakstad doubled the lead eight minutes later with a superb diving header to divert Kelly's left-footed cross-cum-shot into the bottom corner.Then, with Brighton reeling, Laura Coombs added a third on 26 minutes with a fierce strike from 20 yards out that gave Walsh no chance.City could have added to their lead before the break and would have done were it not for a fine save from Walsh to deny Coombs in stoppage time, while Deyna Castellanos hit the post early in the second half.Brighton were much improved after the restart, though, and were rewarded for their efforts by Lee Geum-min's scrambled consolation in the final minute.Victory took City back to within three points of Manchester United and Arsenal in second and third place, while Brighton drop to second bottom.It is highly likely Lionesses forward Kelly has already lived the moment for which she will most be remembered.Scoring to win England the Euros in extra-time at Wembley really was the stuff of dreams.But at 24, Kelly has time to create many more memorable moments and, on this showing, you expect they won't be too far away.Super sub in that famous triumph against Germany, everything she did against Brighton suggests Kelly can shine further on the international stage.You had to feel for Brighton left-back Poppy Pattinson with the way Kelly seemed to toy with her throughout the opening half, cutting inside one minute before bursting past her on the outside the next.One particular jinking run early in the game had Pattinson in such a tangle it was impressive she even managed to stay on her feet.With the game won, Kelly was withdrawn on the hour mark, but still created seven chances in the game - four more than anyone else.She might not have been able to cap her performance with a goal but she was the creator supreme, both for herself and others.Formation  4-3-3Formation  4-4-2Match ends, Manchester City Women 3, Brighton and Hove Albion Women 1.Second Half ends, Manchester City Women 3, Brighton and Hove Albion Women 1.Goal!

4,Shaw stars for Man City in WSL win at Everton,BBC News,,2022-11-19,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63606404,"Last updated on 19 November 202219 November 2022.From the section Women's FootballKhadija Shaw is the ""focal point"" of the Manchester City team, said manager Gareth Taylor after the forward bagged her eighth goal of the Women's Super League campaign City's victory over Everton.Julie Blakstad opened the scoring but it was a good piece of work from Shaw, who picked up a looped ball from Leila Ouahabi as Everton goalkeeper Emily Ramsey came out of her goal to meet Shaw, leaving an empty net for the Jamaican to square the ball to Blakstad who slotted home.""She does so much more than score goals, the way she takes the hits as well as giving the hits out,"" said Taylor.""She's also very strong and she's looking a lot fitter. She's found a rhythm now in knowing she's the focal point of the team.""Everton equalised from a corner when a scramble in the box saw former Toffees keeper Sandy MacIver try to punch the ball away, but it fell straight to Rikke Sevecke who powered a header into the back of the net.But Shaw was there again to tap in the rebound and restore City's lead just after half-time when Laura Coombs fired an ambitious shot which smacked off the post.This is City's fifth consecutive victory in the Women's Super League and moves them fourth, level on points with Manchester United in third.Meanwhile, the loss was Everton's third consecutive home defeat of the season and leaves them seventh in the WSL.Arsenal host Manchester United at Emirates Stadium in Saturday's late kick-off.Replacing England's top goalscorer Ellen White, who retired after the summer Euros, as the starting number nine at City is no mean feat but it is a mantle Shaw has taken on with ease.The 25-year-old's goalscoring form continues to devastate WSL teams as she notched her eighth goal in seven games, the most in the WSL, and caused Everton trouble throughout.She sent in a cross for Blakstad whose header went over the bar but, with four of Shaw's goals this season coming from headers, City would have preferred a role reversal.Shaw also had a goal ruled out for offside when she made a run deep into the Everton half and her shot from near the byeline found the back of the net.""A lot of her play was very high standard today,"" said boss Taylor. ""She was always there, she probably could've had a hat-trick today. It's great she scored but we're always thinking about how do we support and help her to play more consistently.""City, whose brilliance has gone somewhat under the radar this season with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United dominating the headlines, have won their past five consecutive league games after back-to-back losses at the start of the campaign.""We believe we can win the league still. We want to pick off the games one by one,"" said Taylor.""Having spent more time with players you can see the rhythm we're gaining, the communication is improving, the players are understanding the style more and more.""They had the chance to extend their lead when a cross ricocheted off the post to Kelly, who attempted an overhead kick which was helped along by Blakstad but her header hit the post.Unlike last season when City struggled for depth because of injuries, they seem to be clicking with a strong starting line-up and options on the bench.City will however be without winger Lauren Hemp until at least the derby, Taylor confirmed, after she picked up a knock in the 3-0 win over Reading last time out and was left out of the England squad for the Lionesses' recent international friendlies.Everton have now lost all 13 WSL matches against City - the worst record one team has against another in the competition.The Toffees have also not managed to win a game this season when conceding the first goal.They did have chances to get something from the match and the additions of Aggie Beever-Jones and Gio made an impact late on while the Toffees were fairly solid defensively.With just one goal separating the two sides Everton had chances to level proceedings when Gio was through on goal but opted to square instead where Ouahabi blocked, before Beever-Jones smashed a shot into the side-netting.A frantic final 10 minutes saw both sides go close as Ramsey was called upon to save a Kelly shot heading for the top corner, after Beever-Jones had another chance to level but her shot was weak.They were missing perhaps a moment of brilliance from someone like Jess Park, who, after scoring on her England debut last week, was unable to play against her parent club.Formation  5-3-2Formation  4-3-3Match ends, Everton Women 1, Manchester City Women 2.Second Half ends, Everton Women 1, Manchester City Women 2.Julie Blakstad (Manchester City Women) wins a free kick on the right wing.Foul by Gio (Everton Women).Corner,  Manchester City Women.

5,Chelsea survive scare to move clear at top of WSL,BBC News,,2022-12-11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63849450,"Last updated on 11 December 202211 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballChelsea ensured they will spend the winter break three points clear at the Women's Super League summit by holding off Reading at a snowy Kingsmeadow.Fran Kirby's early finish set the tone as the hosts dominated the first half, with Jelena Cankovic scoring twice.Cankovic stroked in after Johanna Rytting Kaneryd struck a post and headed in a cross four minutes later.But Reading then struck twice in two second-half minutes, through Sanne Troelsgaard and Amalie Eikeland.Troelsgaard's low shot squirmed under Ann-Katrin Berger following some uncertain defending before Eikeland fired in off a post as their side threatened to end Chelsea's eight-match winning league run.Chelsea manager Emma Hayes defended Berger but said her side had let their standards slip after surging into a commanding lead.""I'm not going to target individuals,"" said Hayes. ""As a team, I felt we were complacent and Ann has been a top goalkeeper for a long time.""While she will have wanted to do better, we did not do well enough as a team in the second half.""The reigning champions had seen Arsenal draw level with them at the top of the table by beating Aston Villa earlier on Sunday.Reading were aggrieved by Kirby's opener, as provider Kaneryd appeared to be offside when she collected the ball.The third-bottom Royals remain seven points clear of trouble after an 11th away game without victory.Reading head coach Phil Cousins was booked for protesting - with some justification - about Kirby's goal being permitted, although it is unlikely Chelsea's spirited opponents would have held them at bay for much longer even if it had been ruled out.Despite the testing conditions, Reading's determination to press paid off when Millie Bright failed to deal convincingly with a cross and Berger allowed Troelsgaard's low shot to roll under her.The team who had been beaten 5-0 on their previous two trips to Chelsea could not complete what would have been a remarkable comeback to claim an unlikely point.Captain Emma Harries said the strugglers were ""gutted"" to have lost. ""People didn't even expect us to come here and contend with the likes of Chelsea but it shows that we can compete with the best teams,"" she added.On this form, though, Reading can look forward to their return to WSL action in January - and Chelsea's challengers for the title will have watched on encouraged as the leaders laboured to victory.Chelsea goalscorer Kirby - born in Reading, and a graduate of their youth system - has rarely shown mercy to her hometown club, playing a direct role in 11 goals in eight appearances against them.The England livewire averaged comfortably more than a goal a game during her three years as a first-teamer with the Royals, and her eighth against them relied on a piece of quick thinking from a free-kick and a failure from the officials to spot an apparent clear offside.The early first goal was reward for a crowd of 1,184 who sang Always Look on the Bright Side of Life during the early stages as they braved freezing conditions to watch the final game of the calendar year at Kingsmeadow.Formation  3-4-1-2Formation  4-1-3-2Match ends, Chelsea Women 3, Reading Women 2.Second Half ends, Chelsea Women 3, Reading Women 2.Corner,  Chelsea Women.

6,Liverpool claim last-gasp WSL draw at Brighton,BBC News,,2022-11-20,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63612799,"Last updated on 20 November 202220 November 2022.From the section Women's Footballcomments32Rachel Furness headed a 92nd-minute equaliser as Liverpool ended their six-match losing run in a thriller at Brighton.England newcomer Katie Robinson's stunning long-range strike for the hosts was the pick of the goals as Elisabeth Terland and Danielle Carter also netted after Missy Bo Kearns' opener for Liverpool during the first half.Shanice van de Sanden's half-time introduction proved a turning point for Liverpool, nodding in with 14 minutes remaining and setting up Furness' last-gasp leveller.In the 42nd match of the campaign, the first top-flight game of 2022-23 to end without a victory leaves Liverpool in 10th place, three points above bottom side Leicester.Brighton are three points further clear in ninth and remain unbeaten in two matches under interim head coach Amy Merricks.With only one more goal than lowest WSL scorers Leicester at the start of the afternoon, Liverpool's surrender of their lead within four minutes was a worrying blow for a team in search of their first points since their opening-day win over Chelsea.Melissa Lawley showed vision and speed to break free inside the penalty area and fizz in an inviting delivery for Kearns to finish, providing a welcome addition to their total of three goals this season.That meagre tally made it seem unlikely the visitors would find the firepower to end their miserable run once they had fallen two goals behind. But the entrance of substitute Van de Sanden proved pivotal on the Netherlands legend's return from an achilles problem.Former Brighton regular Emma Koivisto also went close for the Reds, who were denied by the crossbar as they avoided a third consecutive defeat in this fixture in dramatic fashion.Matt Beard's side now have the chance to move away from trouble when they visit Reading, who are level on points with them, on Thursday.Robinson, 20, will not forget the most memorable week of her career so far, playing a starring role as the Seagulls made it eight goals in two games since the 8-0 defeat to Tottenham that signalled the end of former manager Hope Powell's reign in their previous home match.Robinson's impressive performances were rewarded by an England debut against Norway on Tuesday.Merricks said in the build-up to this game that Robinson would be buoyed rather than distracted by her Lionesses bow, and the youngster's challenging start to her senior career will surely enhance her mood.After an ACL injury kept her out of the 2020-21 season, the former England youth international signed a new contract at Brighton, made her WSL debut and also had a loan spell at Charlton earlier this year.The patience Robinson and her club showed has paid off, and her shot that looped over Eartha Cumings' outstretched arm was as destined for the highlights reels as it was for the roof of the net.Formation  4-4-2Formation  3-4-3Match ends, Brighton and Hove Albion Women 3, Liverpool Women 3.Second Half ends, Brighton and Hove Albion Women 3, Liverpool Women 3.Attempt missed.

7,Miedema strikes as Arsenal keep pace at top of WSL,BBC News,,2022-12-03,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63765147,"Last updated on 3 December 20223 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballVivianne Miedema's goal ensured Arsenal kept pace in the Women's Super League title race as the Gunners returned to winning ways at home to Everton.Miedema produced a superb finish after 24 minutes, creating space for herself in the penalty area before firing spectacularly past Emily Ramsey.The Dutch striker was left with her hands on her head after she was denied by last-ditch Everton defending following a second-half corner at Meadow Park.But the single goal proved enough for Jonas Eidevall's side to respond positively to seeing their 14-match winning run ended by Manchester United a fortnight ago.  Arsenal were able to welcome back England captain Leah Williamson following a two-month absence because of a foot injury, with the 25-year-old coming on as a second-half-substitute.But Everton goalkeeper Emily Ramsey, who denied Caitlin Foord late on among her 12 saves, prevented the Gunners being assured of victory up until the final whistle.A 14th successive win over Everton moved Arsenal level with Manchester United, who earlier thrashed Aston Villa 5-0, and Chelsea after eight games - before the Blues' match against Leicester City concludes.Arsenal have not lost consecutive league games since February 2021, while they last lost back-to-back home games in the competition in September 2016. Following the excellent Miedema's classy opener midway through the first half they rarely appeared in danger of suffering such a fate - although they could not put the game completely out of reach of a determined Everton.A dramatic 3-2 loss to Manchester United in their last league outing ended an 18-game unbeaten run for the Gunners - and suggested a four-team title race is a very real possibility this season.Manager Eidevall will be satisfied with this response after Miedema delivered the moment of quality required to clinch the points in Borehamwood.Having ended a seven-game wait for a goal last week with an equaliser against Juventus that keeps Arsenal in control of their Champions League group, the 26-year-old collected Caitlin Foord's pass and wrongfooted two defenders as she cut back on to her right foot before slamming the ball into the top corner.Miedema looked full of confidence after that spectacular finish, frequently dropping back to help her team and playing a key role in her side's most threatening attacks.She attempted seven shots - a tally matched only by team-mate Frida Maanum - but was left in disbelief as she was twice prevented from stabbing in at close-range as the Everton defence put their bodies on the line.Everton, for whom Jessica Park proved an exciting influence, struggled to manoeuvre themselves into promising positions but Nicoline Sorensen and Karen Holmgaard went close to snatching a late equaliser amid a flurry of late attempts.Lotte Wubben-Moy and Foord went close as they hosts pushed to seal the points, but victory accompanied by a 200th club appearance for the returning Williamson represented a pleasing afternoon for Arsenal.Formation  4-3-3Formation  4-3-3Match ends, Arsenal Women 1, Everton Women 0.Second Half ends, Arsenal Women 1, Everton Women 0.Caitlin Foord (Arsenal Women) wins a free kick on the left wing.Foul by Rikke Sevecke (Everton Women).Offside, Arsenal Women.

8,West Ham secure derby win at Tottenham in WSL,BBC News,,2022-12-11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63849444,"Last updated on 11 December 202211 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballDagny Brynjarsdottir and Hawa Cissoko scored second-half goals as West Ham secured a London derby win at Tottenham in the Women's Super League.Having missed a first-half penalty, Brynjarsdottir collected a loose ball and fired the visitors in front after 49 minutes.Cissoko struck on a late counter attack for the Hammers, who look set to end the calendar year fifth in the WSL.Defeat was Spurs' third in a row as they stayed seventh.The Hammers went three points ahead of Aston Villa, in sixth, who lost 4-1 to Arsenal on Sunday.Victory means West Ham have now won three of their past four matches, bouncing back from last weekend's loss to out-of-form Liverpool.They were the better side at the Breyer Group Stadium in Leyton and were awarded a penalty when Spurs defender Kerys Harrop took out Kate Longhurst on the edge of the box on the stroke of half-time.Brynjarsdottir's spot-kick was poor, well wide of the target, although she would make amends with her goal shortly after the restart, her fifth in 10 WSL matches this season.Spurs piled on the pressure late on, only to leave space at the back for Hammers centre-half Cissoko to burst forward and chip the ball over onrushing goalkeeper Rebecca Spencer in the 83rd minute.It was to be the last meaningful piece of action as the defender marked her first start since returning from a five-match suspension with her first league goal for West Ham.The Hammers have never finished higher than seventh in their two WSL campaigns.But, after a fifth league win from 10 games, they remain set to make club history in manager Paul Konchesky's first season in charge.While Tottenham, who have now lost five of their eight WSL matches this term, are in mid-table, closer in points to bottom club Leicester than they are to the top three.Formation  3-4-3Formation  4-3-3Match ends, Tottenham Hotspur Women 0, West Ham United Women 2.Second Half ends, Tottenham Hotspur Women 0, West Ham United Women 2.Attempt missed.

9,Bumper weekend shows WSL must grow to keep up,BBC News,,2022-11-20,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63697262,"Last updated on 20 November 202220 November 2022.From the section Women's FootballElsie, nine, had travelled up from near Brighton with her parents Rob and Vicky and big brother Olly. She clutched a sign asking her favourite player Lauren James for her shirt, and couldn't wait to watch her first football match.Speaking to BBC Sport outside Stamford Bridge before Chelsea and Tottenham's Women's Super League match on Sunday, Vicky said: ""We watched all the women's matches through the Euros, they're both into football a lot.""I just think it's a great day out, the women's game is really escalating and we want to be a part of that. We thought it would be a great occasion.""We just went to the [club] museum, saw the pictures of all the Champions League matches - we'll definitely be coming for more whether here or at their usual playing ground.""What Chelsea - and English women's football at large - will hope for is that fans like Vicky and Elsie will come back for more, and that it is not just a great day out.This weekend saw the WSL take the spotlight in English football, between the Premier League taking a break for the 2022 World Cup and Gareth Southgate's men beginning their campaign on Monday lunchtime.It produced some great spectacle - Manchester United's thrilling late comeback at Arsenal, the breathless 3-3 draw between Liverpool and Brighton, Erin Cuthbert's sumptuous volley as Chelsea bet Spurs 3-0.It also drew in impressive crowds. Chelsea women broke their home attendance record as they played at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2019. More than 40,000 supporters were at Emirates Stadium on Saturday evening.Good attendances reached into the Championship too. Sheffield United Women drew a record crowd of 11,137 to Bramall Lane for their 2-0 defeat to London City Lionesses.The question now is how to do this on a consistent basis, and turn fans from occasional day trippers to dedicated supporters who follow the WSL and its clubs week in, week out. As Manchester United manager Marc Skinner put it last week, getting ""brains on seats"".Things are heading in the right direction. WSL average attendance in August 2020 was 3,092; in November 2022 it is 5,099. The aim is for 6,000 by 2024.There are growing pains, however. Chelsea's regular home, Kingsmeadow, only has a capacity of 4,850. Arsenal usually play at Meadow Park, which can hold 4,500 at most.Women's football in England, super-charged by the success of the Lionesses at Euro 2022, is starting to outgrow its usual surroundings. Which raises the question of what comes next.Reading boss Kelly Chambers believes it is an opportunity the women's game needs to seize.Speaking before their 3-1 defeat to Aston Villa, played at Villa Park, she said: ""Off the back of the Euros, we knew the biggest change we wanted to see happen this year was getting more fans in the door, watching the games, but not only that, grow the fanbase too.""It's all well and good having fans turn up to the stadium every so often, but what we want to is ensure they are embedded into our experience, and leave them wanting more.""Chelsea manager Emma Hayes wants more games at Stamford Bridge, but feels there also has to be a middle ground found between the Champions League arena and the stadium they used to share with AFC Wimbledon.At her post-match press conference on Sunday, she said: ""I'd like to be here [at Stamford Bridge] more. I think we all know that solving the conundrum in the women's game around what do we do from small stadia, is there a medium-term plan to go to medium-size stadiums before eventually everyone comes home to the large stadium?""I don't know, but I'm absolutely certain we're all outgrowing our small stadiums, that I'm sure of.""Hayes feels the domestic women's game needs to be braver, starting with raising ticket prices to capitalise on its sky-high popularity - albeit without reaching the often exorbitant prices of the men's game.Adult tickets for Chelsea v Tottenham  cost as little as £9external-link, with under-20s and over-65s able to attend for as little as a pound.When the Blues host Paris St-Germain in the Champions League in December - a meeting between two titans of women's European football - everyone will again be able to go for less than a tenner.external-link""I think one of the biggest things that perhaps we don't talk enough about is how cheap women's football is,"" Hayes said. ""I really believe we have to increase the overall pricing structure if we're to play more in these places, because there is a cost implication to it.""I think the audiences are there, not for every game, but certainly for maybe eight games, 12 games a year. We have to be more ambitious for ourselves. Is it too cheap to watch women's football? I think it is, especially for the top games.""As well as Manchester United on Saturday, Arsenal play their home Champions League matches at Emirates Stadium this season. While these games have drawn much lower crowds, they are ensuring the women's club game at England's biggest stadia is becoming normal.They also faced Tottenham at the men's ground earlier this campaign, winning 4-0 in September in front of a club record 47,367.Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall said of the Emirates: ""I think it's one of our two homes. And from the time I've been here, we feel more and more that this is our home.""A notable addition for this weekend's big stadium matches was away ends. Usually WSL crowds are mixed, which can lead to a competitive atmosphere being nixed.There was no risk of this on Saturday night, as the Manchester United players celebrated wildly with their travelling fans following Alessia Russo's late winner.They then went straight to the fans at the final whistle, something Skinner said they made a point of doing rather than entering their usual full-time on-pitch conference.He said of away ends after the match: ""Whether it's concrete proof or not, if you give us away ends you will get a lot of fans through the door. Tonight was a good indicator of that.""We just had to go to them at the end, usually we just go into a huddle, it was good to know where they were."" The WSL is in a unique place, boosted over the summer like never before and continuing through until Christmas as the Premier League sits on pause until Qatar 2022 concludes.It must now capitalise - to ensure Elsie, and the thousands of others like her with their home-made signs, come back for more.Match of the Day: Top 10 ranks the best of the bestThey sat down for a revelatory chat during the rock star's whirlwind tourMouth-watering recipes which will make everyone happy regardless of the result on the pitch    Watch all of Lionel Messi's World Cup goals so far as he prepares to lead Argentina against Croatia in the semi-finals at Qatar 2022.There may be an air of disappointment after England's World Cup exit but here is why fans of the Three Lions have reason to feel optimistic.See every card from Argentina's intense quarter-final match with the Netherlands, which set a World Cup record of 18 yellow cards shown in a single match.

11,Late Man Utd double ends Arsenal's perfect WSL start,BBC News,,2022-11-19,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63606405,"Last updated on 19 November 202219 November 2022.From the section Women's FootballManchester United produced a stunning late comeback to end Arsenal's 100% start in the Women's Super League.In front of more than 40,000 fans at Emirates Stadium, Arsenal trailed to an Ella Toone goal at half-time.They equalised when Frida Maanum's shot took a deflection off Maya Le Tissier, before Laura Wienroither looked to have earned a 15th straight league win.But headers by Millie Turner and Alessia Russo in the final five minutes completed a sensational turnaround.It ends a 14-game league winning run for Arsenal, while United showed why they could be real title contenders under boss Marc Skinner.Inspired by Toone from midfield, they secured a win which moved them level on 18 points with Arsenal and Chelsea at the top of the WSL.With no men's Premier League action this weekend and the World Cup yet to start, the WSL was in the spotlight on Saturday - and an extraordinary end to this game ensured that focus was not wasted.After an inert first half, Arsenal were sparked into life 37 seconds after half-time.Maanum ran with the ball from inside her own half, and the Norwegian's shot was heading off target until it flew off the back heel of Le Tissier and into the opposite corner over the helpless Mary Earps.Vivianne Miedema was introduced to huge cheers with just over half an hour left to play, but it was the much less heralded Wienroither who looked to have scored the winner with 17 minutes left, racing on to a deep cross from full-back partner Katie McCabe and brilliantly half-volleying home from 10 yards.However United battled all night and took the win with two headers from set-pieces.On 85 minutes, Katie Zelem put a free-kick on a six pence and Turner thumped a header against the crossbar and over the line.The turnaround was then completed in stoppage time as Russo turned the ball into the corner of the net, sparking celebrations in a packed away end.Both Arsenal men and women were top of their respective leagues going into this weekend, and the buzz around Emirates Stadium pre-match was about the possibility of a unique double this season.Arsenal had won 14 consecutive league games going into this match, but in an inert opening 45 minutes they were completely stifled by United.England's Beth Mead, Jordan Nobbs and Lotte Wubben-Moy all started, but the Lionesses failed to roar as United dominated possession and took a deserved lead following a goalkeeper error.Arsenal's Manuela Zinsberger had made a fine early save to palm away a Leah Galton effort, but she had already skewed one punch before she flapped at Hayley Ladd's 39th-minute cross from the byline, allowing Toone to side-foot home.So poor were Arsenal in the first half, the brightest moment came when the home fans put on a light show with their mobile phone torches.They improved markedly in the second half, however were ultimately outfought by a United side who had won their opening five games before a 3-1 home defeat to Chelsea a fortnight ago saw them slip to third in the table.This time they kept their belief as they prevented Arsenal's silky front three from getting into any sort of groove, before earning three points in truly dramatic circumstances.And there were worrying scenes at the end for the Gunners as Mead was seen in tears after being substituted with an injury. Skinner had called for ""brains on seats"" before the game, meaning that women's football has to attract dedicated fans rather than day trippers.If the 40,064 spectators at this game have some sense, they will surely think to come back for more after that spectacular conclusion.Formation  4-3-3Formation  4-1-4-1Match ends, Arsenal Women 2, Manchester United Women 3.Second Half ends, Arsenal Women 2, Manchester United Women 3.Substitution, Arsenal Women.

12,Leaders Chelsea hit eight at bottom club Leicester,BBC News,,2022-12-03,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63765142,"Last updated on 3 December 20223 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballChelsea made light work of bottom side Leicester to maintain their impressive Women's Super League title defence at the King Power Stadium.The Blues were five goals up at the break thanks to Guro Reiten, Fran Kirby, Jessie Fleming, Niamh Charles and Sam Kerr.Fleming then grabbed her second and substitute Beth England headed home number seven.Kirby added an eighth on a ruthless afternoon for the leaders.It took just four minutes for Chelsea to take the lead through Reiten, who slid the ball into the bottom corner after clever link-up play with Kirby.Reiten then got the first of four assists eight minutes later, slotting the ball into Fleming and leaving her with a simple finish from close range.Fully in control, Chelsea began to exert themselves further, scoring three times in the final six minutes of the opening half.Kirby got in on the act with a classy outside-of-the-boot finish, before Charles headed home from a Reiten corner.Not to be left out, Kerr added a fifth as Reiten's assist stole the show again. Her searching ball left the Australian with an easy task, but her finish was typically emphatic.Five minutes after the break, Fleming added to Leicester's misery. Jemma Purfield's weak clearance from Charles' cross fell to her, and she dispatched with confidence.Moments after their introduction, Alsu Abdullina and England linked up for the latter to head home a seventh 15 minutes from time.There was still time for Kirby to bundle home late on, with Abdullina involved again.This result is hardly a surprise. Leicester, albeit improving in terms of performances under Willie Kirk, came into this game bottom of the table without a point from their first eight games.By contrast, the champions kicked off knowing they'd need a victory to stay there after Manchester United's thumping win over Aston Villa at Old Trafford.Although they couldn't match or surpass their numerical dominance from their last visit to the King Power back in March when they won 9-0, their dominance here was just as evident.It was the Reiten show in the first half, and her ball for Kerr was particularly eye-catching as she enjoyed a record-equalling four assists in the WSL. But the difference in quality was so great that almost everybody had their moment on the occasion of coach Emma Hayes' 300th match in charge.Leicester battled well, but will be relieved their season will not be defined by tough games like this as they remain four points adrift of 11th-placed Reading.Formation  4-3-3Formation  3-4-3Match ends, Leicester City Women 0, Chelsea Women 8.Second Half ends, Leicester City Women 0, Chelsea Women 8.Attempt saved.

13,Title-chasing Arsenal enjoy comeback win at Villa,BBC News,,2022-12-11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63849447,"Last updated on 11 December 202211 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballBoss Jonas Eidevall says Arsenal ""are in a great position"" in the Women's Super League after coming from behind to brush aside Aston Villa.Kirsty Hanson's 20-yard strike gave the hosts a shock early lead but Rachel Corsie's own goal drew Arsenal level.Vivianne Miedema, Katie McCabe and Jordan Nobbs struck to take Arsenal above Manchester United into second.""It's important we are professional and get the job done - the team maturity pleased me,"" Eidevall told Sky Sports.""It was very good to keep our patience and composure even if we conceded a goal at the beginning,"" he added.""It's five or six minutes into the game, we don't need to respond in any drastic way in that moment. ""It's about having belief in our gameplan and not changing or letting the emotions take over at that point. It was good to see we continued to create a lot of scoring opportunities. ""We have had three games in a row where we have only, by our high standards, scored one goal in each game. That's why I think it was important from a self-confidence perspective to put a few more of the opportunities away today.""Victory briefly took Arsenal level on points with leaders Chelsea but the Blues re-established a three-point cushion by beating Reading 3-2 later on Sunday.Eidevall's side still hold a game in hand over their London rivals - and the two sides meet in their first game of 2023 when Arsenal host Chelsea on 15 January.This win was an eighth successive away triumph in the WSL for Arsenal, who always looked in control after cancelling out the early deficit, even if sixth-placed Villa did provide spirited opposition throughout.""All in all, I think we're in a great position in the league and now we need to focus on the Champions League,"" added Eidevall, whose side face Lyon and Zurich in their final two group games before Christmas.At the final whistle at Villa Park, both Arsenal and Chelsea had identical records of eight wins and just one defeat from nine WSL matches this term.That suggests this season's title race will be just as tight as last year when Chelsea pipped the Gunners by just a point. Perhaps it will be even tighter this time, with the two Manchester clubs not far behind.Last season, Arsenal were left to rue a surprise defeat at relegated Birmingham City that was construed by many to have cost them the title - and they looked in danger of suffering more 'second city' misery after Hanson's sixth-minute opener.The on-loan Manchester United forward took Kenza Dali's pass in her stride before firing a fine finish across Manuela Zinsberger into the far corner from the left-hand edge of the penalty area.Arsenal continued to look nervy at the back as Laura Blindkilde Brown's mis-hit cross struck Zinsberger's crossbar, but the Gunners retained their own threat going forward.Hannah Hampton saved well from Miedema before Hanson's opener, while Caitlin Foord blazed off target when well placed and McCabe's 25-yard free-kick whistled inches over.There was a slice of fortune about Arsenal's 26th-minute equaliser as Hampton's attempt to palm out McCabe's cross struck Corsie and ricocheted in, despite Danielle Turner's effort to clear it off the line.Arsenal led four minutes later as the luckless Hampton punched a corner straight to Miedema, who volleyed home through a crowd of bodies.After finishes of ninth and 10th in their first two WSL seasons, Carla Ward's Villa are progressing despite a raft of injuries and had won four of their past five games in league and cup.After the break, Alisha Lehmann and Dali both tested Zinsberger, but Arsenal possessed the greater quality in the attacking third, evidenced by incisive moves for their third and fourth goals.Lia Walti sent Steph Catley away and her cross was parried for Hampton for McCabe to slot home before Foord's low ball was expertly swept home by substitute Nobbs with six minutes left.Both teams now have more than a month off before their next game and Villa boss Ward is grateful for the break.""Now is the right time - I think everybody needs it mentally and physically,"" she said.""I think this next three or four weeks is a chance to not only get players back but also to bring three or four more faces into the building. That always lifts spirits.""Formation  4-3-3Formation  4-2-3-1Match ends, Aston Villa Women 1, Arsenal Women 4.Second Half ends, Aston Villa Women 1, Arsenal Women 4.Attempt blocked.

""This club know how to do football,"" says Manchester United's new Head of Women’s Football, Polly Bancroft, in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports; watch Arsenal vs Man Utd live on Sky Sports Main Event on Saturday; kick-off 5.30pm By Lynsey Hooper, Sky Sports' lead WSL reporter Saturday 19 November 2022 07:16, UKThe appointment of Polly Bancroft as Head of Women’s Football at Manchester United has positioned her as one of the most powerful executives within the English women's game. In this unique, brand-new role, Bancroft will be responsible for helping take United to the very top of European football.Bancroft started the process to become Manchester United's first Head of Women's Football much like any other job application.""I saw the advert!"" she told Sky Sports in an exclusive interview. ""I was immediately interested in the scale of the role and the opportunity that this brand has, both in terms of women's first team participation in the Women's Super League, but more broadly than that, the power of the brand internationally as well, and the power for good that it brings.""Bancroft had spent the past two years as the general manager for Brighton Women's team, having previously worked for UEFA and The FA.""Bringing integration and collaboration was how I worked [at Brighton],"" she explains. ""There's certainly an appetite to do that at Manchester United as well.""There's so much knowledge and experience within the club. This club know how to do football.

            ""And yet it's balancing that understanding of female athletes and the female game with the understanding and learning on the men's side. [It's about] those two blends of specialism and experience and bringing them together.""The role, 'Head of Women's Football', is quite unique within the women's game but it is a position that Bancroft thinks we will see more clubs in the WSL adopting, as they realise they cannot necessarily translate their understanding of the men's game neatly to the women's.""There are certain nuances in terms of working with female athletes. We're in a different league so there are certain different rules and regulations that need to be met. So it's not using a copy and paste model, but it is understanding the needs of the game, and being able to navigate through that.""At United, the position will be a board role that combines both business and football elements.""I think the role has got various different layers,"" says Bancroft. ""Clearly it's to work really closely with Marc [Skinner], the players and the staff with the women's first team. But also throughout the pathway as well.""We've got eight female teams within the club and we've also just started up an Emerging Talent Centre as well.""So it's supporting all those women and girls within the pathway, then further integrating women's football within the club. It is working with the recruitment department, the club secretaries, commercial, the legal department.""And then I suppose the third layer is working with key stakeholders in the game. Working with the FA, broadcasters, and our supporters' club to further develop the women's game.""Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe fact that women's football is only growing with every passing season means that many of the challenges Bancroft might face in her new role are not even obvious yet.One such change that is likely to come is the WSL transitioning away from being managed by the FA, something that Chelsea manager Emma Hayes has called for.""[We're] looking internally in terms of our role in those conversations. We have members across the club that are heavily involved in various different committees within the FA, and I think we've got an excellent role and a good voice… in those conversations.""There's a lot of dialogue between the clubs and with the FA into the best future for the women's game. Everybody is committed to finding the best home for the women's game in the long term.""That is just one potential development that Bancroft will be looking to navigate in her new role. There are certainly other challenges on a more day-to-day level.""I think because the breadth of the role is so large - it's football and non-football, it's working out the priorities to make the biggest impact.""I think [it's about] being able to be mindful of the different requests that come through, whether that's in marketing, in recruitment, and working with staff.""So I think it's just being able to be really clear what the priorities are, and then sticking to your guns and using your knowledge and experience but doing it in a good way.""Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerObviously with a club the size of Manchester United, it will still come back first and foremost to what happens on the pitch.There have been three consecutive fourth-placed finishes in the WSL but there are now also three Euro 2022 winners in the squad in Mary Earps, Alessia Russo and Ella Toone. The expectations are only going to get higher.""There's been rapid growth. This is the fifth season in the new era.""We're ambitious and we want to win every game. We want to compete in the latter stages of every competition that we're in. And everyone's really rallying behind Marc and the team from across the club to help us achieve.""In Bancroft, Manchester United might have found the final piece in their puzzle.Watch Arsenal Women vs Man United Women live on Sky Sports Main Event on Saturday from 5.15pm; kick-off 5.30pm.

15,Man City held by Man Utd in entertaining WSL derby,BBC News,,2022-12-11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63849445,"Last updated on 11 December 202211 December 2022.From the section Women's FootballManchester City played out a thrilling draw against neighbours and top-three rivals Manchester United at Etihad Stadium in front of the second-largest crowd in Women's Super League history.After a positive start from the hosts, their momentum took a knock when Leah Galton skipped past City defender Laia Aleixandri and played a one-two with Ella Toone before driving through the legs of Alex Greenwood in the 27th minute.City's first-half response was not encouraging for the subdued crowd of 44,259 - a record attendance for the hosts - and the opening exchanges of the second period did not make for better viewing.But Laura Coombs' header from Chloe Kelly's cross - which had evaded United defender Millie Turner, who was distracted by the presence of the WSL's top goal scorer Khadija Shaw - drew City level and sparked them and the home crowd into life.What ensued was an entertaining, end-to-end encounter, with both sides knowing a point - even though it was probably a fair result - would be no good to them if the title race and push for third-place goes down to the wire.City are fourth in the table, three points behind third-placed United after nine games. They trail leaders Chelsea by five points following the Blues' win over Reading on Sunday evening, but United have played one game fewer.The result means United have still never beaten their city rivals in the WSL. The hosts started the game well and for 20 minutes United struggled to deal with City's high press as the Blues limited their only chance to a Katie Zelem set-piece, smothered by goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck.But as the first half went on and the visitors managed to break through that press, City struggled to create any meaningful chances and momentary flashes of brilliance from Lauren Hemp, who did not see enough of the ball, were the only thing a subdued crowd could find to cheer about.City's frustrations came to a head when Leila Ouahabi's diving tackle cut out a superb driving run from Hannah Blundell and the former Barcelona defender screamed at her City team-mates, furious that Blundell had been able to make the run.The home side started the second half much the same and Coombs' headed goal came out of nowhere but it was the catalyst City needed to raise their game.Kelly sent in a dangerous ball that looked set for the back of the net before firing over the bar on the volley, while Hemp's low cross was skewed over the bar before it could reach the arriving Shaw.Earps twice denied the head of Shaw and the Jamaican striker almost had the chance to volley home after a scramble in the box as the crowd sensed something could be brewing.City manager Gareth Taylor paced his technical area, while United counterpart Marc Skinner opted for a more controlled position on the bench, as the crowd inside the Etihad willed the home side to find an elusive winner.After what started as a dispiriting City performance, Taylor will probably be disappointed his side could not wrap up the victory and firmly put his side among the title contenders.This is the third WSL match in a row that United have played inside the bigger men's stadium and the players seem to be thriving on the big occasion.After a tricky start, where United goalkeeper Earps brilliantly punched Greenwood's deep corner away from the mouth of the goal, Galton and Blundell's link-up play down the left flank paid off.Galton's smash was the first goal United have scored in a Manchester derby at City's ground in the WSL.After the equaliser, United looked fired up and Ella Toone fired over the bar before the game settled but into something more intense than the first half, with Russo going close with her head before Roebuck produced a sensational save from a Martha Thomas header.United had chances to steal the points in the dying seconds as Toone shot over the bar before a mistake from Roebuck afforded Lucia Garcia an opportunity which was superbly blocked by Greenwood.Formation  4-3-3Formation  4-2-3-1Match ends, Manchester City Women 1, Manchester United Women 1.Second Half ends, Manchester City Women 1, Manchester United Women 1.Attempt blocked.

16,'Man Utd have blown the WSL title race wide open',BBC News,,2022-11-19,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63691567,"Last updated on 19 November 202219 November 2022.From the section Women's FootballIt's not how you start, it's how you finish.Few who watched Arsenal's record 14-game winning run in the Women's Super League end on Saturday night at the hands of Manchester United will remember the direct, defensive and error-strewn football which made up the first 75 minutes or so.They will remember the ecstatic celebrations of United manager Marc Skinner, his players and the fans after Millie Turner and Alessia Russo's late headers.On the final day of the dry period between the Premier League ending and the World Cup starting, this WSL game provided a conclusion that will stick in the mind for a long time to come.As Helen Ward said on BBC 5 Live Sports Extra: ""What an advert for the game at a time when there's no Premier League football, two fantastic teams and it blows the title race wide open which is what we all want to see. ""As the dust settles, it becomes clear how right Ward is about the realistic title race expanding from three to four clubs. Manchester United are now part a conversation that has usually been restricted to Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City.With both Arsenal men and women top of their respective leagues going into this weekend, the buzz around Emirates Stadium pre-match was about the possibility of a unique double this season.That buzz is now much more of a murmur after a 15th consecutive league win was turned into a first WSL loss of 2022-23 in the space of five minutes, leaving Skinner dancing and pirouetting on the sidelines.Speaking to Sky Sports, Skinner said: ""I asked them before the game to show personality in these bigger games and I've had that in abundance tonight so I'm the happiest manager on the planet. ""What we probably lose out on with the other teams is the experience we have, but nights like this give us that. When you become autonomous on the football field and make your own decisions, you become a ruthless team and that is what we saw in the performance tonight.""There was plenty of focus pre-match on Arsenal's Lionesses, with Beth Mead, Jordan Nobbs and Lotte Wubben-Moy all starting despite withdrawing from England duty last week.However it was United's England players who stole the show - Russo scoring the winner, Katie Zelem providing assists for both late headers, and Ella Toone scoring the opener and running the midfield show. Russo told Sky Sports: ""The result reflects that belief, the moment we'd conceded we came in as a group and we had an honest conversation.""When we're on the pitch, especially in front of 40,000 people, we can't hear what's coming from the side so we have to take ownership as players and that's what we did tonight.""Russo once again showed she was the player for the big occasion and was named player of the match but Skinner also reserved special praise for Toone in his post-match press conference.""Her ability to find space I've always admired. My job is to keep her on her toes, keep her doing what she does better than most in women's football, finding space. She is mesmeric. She has had a great summer, now I need to manage the next phase.""United won their opening five WSL games, including three out of three in October earning Skinner the manager of the month award.However they suffered a 3-1 home defeat to Chelsea a fortnight ago that saw United slip to third in the table, and seemed to indicate they would once again have to settle for being the best of the rest.This win, and the manner in which they fought for it, suggests otherwise.Former England midfielder Karen Carney said the victory came down to a change in ""mentality"" from the United players, who showed they really believed they could win.""That's the shift Marc Skinner has wanted in this side. They can do it, he has always believed it - and they needed to show it,"" she told Sky Sports.Arsenal, United and Chelsea on Saturday night all sat level at the top with identical records of six wins and a defeat from their opening seven games.Chelsea can strike ahead on Sunday if they beat Tottenham, in another game played at the home club's main stadium - Stamford Bridge.If that game has anything like the conclusion the 40,064 fans witnessed at Emirates Stadium, it will seal a brilliant weekend of advertisement for the WSL - and whip up further excitement for the title race we have to come.","[""What an advert for the game at a time when there's no Premier League football, two fantastic teams and it blows the title race wide open which is what we all want to see.

Liverpool, in 10th place, are now five points clear of the Foxes, while second-bottom Reading have a four-point advantage.But they will feel like they could have won this match, having each gone in front in the second half.The Reds dominated the opening exchanges and deservedly went ahead when Stengel headed in Melissa Lawley's cross, only for teenager Primmer to equalise with a looping shot in first-half injury-time.Reading, whose only league win this season has come against Leicester, were much improved after the break and went 2-1 up through former Liverpool forward Dowie's close-range effort.The visitors, though, bounced back in an entertaining affair, with Stengal adding her fifth of the season and Roberts putting them on course for victory with 17 minutes left.But Reading equalised a second time in the closing stages as Troelsgaard met Amalie Eikeland's cross to deny Liverpool a second league win of the season.It means Matt Beard's side have recorded back-to-back 3-3 draws after ending a six-match losing run against Brighton last weekend.Meanwhile, Reading have now won just one of their past 10 home matches in all competitions and remain a point behind Liverpool.Formation  3-5-2Formation  4-3-3Match ends, Reading Women 3, Liverpool Women 3.Second Half ends, Reading Women 3, Liverpool Women 3.Substitution, Reading Women.

Striker Khadija Shaw is from humble beginnings, but has used a gritty determination to climb to the top - is now her time to shine brighter than ever before?; watch Everton vs Manchester City live on Sky Sports Main Event on Saturday; kick-off 3pmBy Laura Hunter Saturday 19 November 2022 07:16, UK""I could be the one to change football in Jamaica,"" Khadija Shaw remembers thinking as a determined youngster.Bravely, she did not want to be defined by the constraints of Spanish Town, the Jamaican city she grew up in, rather preferring to challenge the narrative typically afforded to young women of the region.But there is nothing typical about Khadija, nicknamed 'Bunny' for her love of carrots. ""It was almost like a waste of time,"" she said in an interview to the BBC after sealing a move to Manchester City in 2021. She was referring to her parents' attitude towards football as a potential profession - not only was it unrealistic, it was viewed as dangerous.""My parents didn't allow me to play because of the lack of opportunities,"" she recalled.Yet Bunny, undeterred by various naysayers, was set on rewriting the script. She refused to be boxed into a stereotype. She wanted to prove that her desire to succeed could outweigh any external longing for her to conform to the regular mould of a young Jamaican female.""One day I was like 'let's strike a deal - I pass my exams and you allow me to play,'"" she said boldly to her hesitant family. Fast forward to 2022 and the forward is taking the scene by storm - both domestically and internationally.It's not a well-trodden pathway, but it's one that Shaw has forged with a combination of resolve, willpower and raw talent. There is a heartwarming sense of gratification about her journey.

No opportunity is wasted, certainly not this season.Shaw has stepped into the role vacated by outgoing striker Ellen White with plenty of promise. Thriving as the star markswoman, the striker has been involved in more goals than any other player in the Women's Super League this term. She's scored in all but one of her six appearances.Many questioned how City would cope when losing their all-time leading scorer over the summer, with White opting to call time on her playing career, but fears have been quickly assuaged. Shaw is the answer.Power, pace, and precision - she has it all. Stepping into the No.9 role at perhaps the perfect time, Shaw looks every bit the part, helped in no small measure by two of the league's deadliest wingers.Lauren Hemp and Chloe Kelly combine with Shaw to create a fearsome front three. With an average age of just 23-and-a-half, this trio have the potential to wreak havoc on opposition defences for many years to come.Hemp has assisted more of Shaw's WSL goals than any other player, including two this season. The England international also leads the WSL in several creative categories, including chances created, shot-creating actions and expected assists.Kelly, meanwhile, ranks marginally lower for creativity, but gets the ball into the box more consistently than any WSL player, which suits Shaw's considerable aerial ability. Indeed, no side has scored more headed goals than Man City this season (five). Four of those have been netted by Shaw.Her impressive two-goal haul against Tottenham in late October prompted manager Gareth Taylor to issue a warning about his striker's prolificacy - ""there's more to come,"" he said. Not what Everton will want to hear ahead of this weekend's WSL encounter, live on Sky Sports.""She had a good season last year, but people overlook that… She has taken on the responsibility of wearing the number nine for this club,"" Taylor added.It was the sense of community that initially drew Shaw to the game in her youth, yet now she's happy to tread a pathway which may well end up putting her in a league of her own. Her background is unique and so is her playing style, driven by boundless determination that translates on the pitch as a hatful of goals.Curbing Bunny's enthusiasm is something Everton are going to have to confront head on if they want any chance of triumphing over a side whom they've never beaten in league competition before.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerMan City have won all 12 of their meetings against the Toffees, the best 100 per cent record one team has against another in WSL history.""I will always keep encouraging and inspiring because it is not impossible,"" Shaw told mancity.com recently. Indeed, the outlook for the 25-year-old is quite the opposite - everything is possible. She is a trailblazer in her field and one that is going to take some stopping.Not many players can claim to have played for their country at the tender age of 13 - by the following year, she had represented Jamaica's Under-17s and Under-20s. Now, she is Jamaica's all-time leading goalscorer, male or female, with 56 goals in 38 appearances.There are a few names that spring to mind when evaluating the WSL's best current strike force. Chelsea has Sam Kerr. Arsenal has Vivianne Miedema. Yet, this year, the inevitability of Shaw's presence in the box is bound to stir things up as the campaign zig-zags in unpredictable directions. You sense her time is now.Will it be enough to power Man City to formal honours during 2022/23, despite a shaky start? Well, triumphing in the face of adversity is exactly what Shaw does best. This season is merely the latest chapter in her epic tale of defiance.Watch Everton vs Manchester City live on Sky Sports Main Event on Saturday from 2.30pm; kick-off 3pm.Super 6 is going International!

Scheuer is understood to have visited the club this week
Former Bayern Munich manager Jens Scheuer has emerged as a leading candidate for Women's Super League club Brighton & Hove Albion's vacant managerial post, Telegraph Sport can reveal.Multiple sources have confirmed that Brighton have spoken to Scheuer about the possibility of the 44-year-old replacing former England head coach Hope Powell, who left the club just over a month ago after five years at the helm.After multiple rounds of interviews, although a final decision has not yet been made, talks are said to be fairly advanced, and Scheuer is understood to have visited the club this week.The WSL side's search for a new manager has been extensive, with several candidates from across Europe also having been interviewed, including the current Linkopings head coach and former Finland manager Andree Jeglertz, who previously won the Uefa Women's Cup with Umea, while Brighton's interim head coach Amy Merricks – who was Powell's assistant – has also been considered for the job full-time amid a good run of form.Former Sweden international and ex-BK Hacken manager Mats Gren is also understood to have been among those under consideration earlier in the process, along with former Norway manager Martin Sjogren, who left the Norwegian national setup after Euro 2022, and the former Wales manager Jayne Ludlow, but Scheuer appears to be the most likely candidate to get the job at this stage, at the time of writing.Brighton's technical director, the former Scotland, Everton and Rangers defender David Weir, has been leading on the club's recruitment process to replace Powell, who stood down on 31 October following a heavy 8-0 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur.Scheuer spent three years in charge of Bayern – winning the German league title in 2021 and reaching the semi-finals of the Women's Champions League – before exiting in May at the end of last season.The Sussex club have been public about their ambitious aims for the women's team to establish themselves as a ""top-four WSL side"" in the long term, and recently formally opened their new, state-of-the-art £8.5 million training centre dedicated solely for their women's and girls' teams' use.They are currently ninth in the top flight with seven points from seven matches this term.We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions

          Senior football journalist
      Saturday 19 November 2022 18:59, UKPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerIt's hard not to enjoy any time spent with Manuela Zinsberger. One of Arsenal's bubbliest characters - across both men and women's teams - she speaks with passion, personality and expression on any question put to her.To top things off, she is having one of the best spells of her career, stretching back to the start of last season. Thirteen clean sheets in the Women's Super League saw her clinch the Golden Glove for the 2021/22 campaign, before setting a new league record when she kept 10 successive clean sheets this calendar year.However, Zinsberger is at pains to point out that anything related to clean sheets is not only down to her, but the entire team playing their part. Putting the team first is something she continually refers to during the interview.Ahead of Arsenal's match against Manchester United live on Sky Sports, the 27-year-old said: ""At the moment I got the Golden Glove, we figured out we hadn't won the title. How would you celebrate?""At the end, it's a really great achievement of an individual, but I don't take it as an individual award because it doesn't mean if I am getting a clean sheet, I have saved all the balls. No, you have to imagine that my 10 players in front of me are keeping the ball as far as possible so it's actually a team achievement.""It may be my name underneath it, but for me, it's totally a team achievement. It's how they put their bodies between the ball and the goal to defend as a unit and as Arsenal, you can see the passion.""At the end, the more clean sheets you have, the possibility keeps improving to win the title and that's where we want to go. If I have the title and not the Golden Glove, I've done everything right.

            ""Of course, I want to keep the clean sheet as often as possible. But we are there to win the big trophies and the little ones, they are part of the personality of the club as well. But we want to win the big ones and if we add on the little ones, we nailed it.""But a clean-sheet record is just the tip of the iceberg for Arsenal this season. They currently sit top of the WSL - level on points with Chelsea, but with a game in hand - and have set a new record for record consecutive league victories. They have won each of their last 14 games.""It's an incredible team achievement,"" Zinsberger reflected. ""Everyone thinks about scoring goals, but first of all, keep the zero, be compact.""It's so much about little things and I think with injuries and so on, you have to compromise so many things, but we have to put the team first and that's the most important thing.""How we defend on the pitch is like putting our passion in it and how we score, there are so many different ones. It's not only one [scorer], it's the team and that's what I love to see. We score as a team and we defend as a team.""It's about the little things, like your running back, and also in the 80th minute, to try and defend even when you're leading 4-0. It's about taking the last whistle of the ref, then you can take a deep breath and relax.""But before that, we are putting everything in for Arsenal and that's what I love to see and hopefully, we can keep progressing in the next couple of games.""One of Arsenal's standout performances this season actually came in the Champions League, when they beat eight-time winners Lyon 5-1 in their first group-stage match - a landmark victory that came on Zinsberger's 27th birthday.She said: ""I was shocked in a positive way. I was always believing in us, I knew it would be possible, but it would be tough against Lyon, who are such a great team.""Just seeing the performance of the team progressing from minute to minute then scoring one, scoring two, then conceding one but still keep going. It didn't impress us that they scored. We knew they were going to be brilliant at corners and free-kicks - they have such tall women in their team, of course they're going to be good. But just watching the team push forward, but still defending with all we have was amazing.""It was my birthday as well and Caitlin Foord, I have her jersey. She wears the No 19 and it was on October 19 and she scored the opening goal. Suddenly, in the game, I thought 'that's it' - not in the way that we should stop, but to keep going [after the first goal].""So my birthday was hilarious, I couldn't imagine winning 5-1 at Lyon.""It's not just Arsenal where Zinsberger shines. She is also No 1 for Austria, where she grew up in a small village 'of around 350 people', she estimates.Actually, the 27-year-old followed in the footsteps of her dad, who also played as a goalkeeper - apologising to him after joking that he was not as good as she is. Like female footballers in the UK, she grew up playing with boys in Austria, and a lack of goalkeeper on her team as a youngster saw her rotate into the position.However, it did not prove to be a popular choice with her parents, although they have of course since become her biggest supporters and cheerleaders.""I found out about my talent with football quite late, I was an outfield player at the beginning,"" she recalled.""I most likely played with boys, kicking a ball around in a small village and just having fun. Once, we were just playing on a soccer field and one of the mums said they had to leave for training and I was left out.""She said 'why are you not joining? Come with me, have a look and if you want to try it out, you can'. When we arrived there, the boys started practising and I was sitting with the mum on the bench and she said 'are you not interested to just try it out' and I wanted to.""After the training session, I had my little piece of paper [consent form] which you need to sign. My mum was not happy about it because she had two girls and one was playing football. But at the end, she was happy that I'd done it and she signed the paper.""I was an outfield player until I was nine and then the goalkeeper had to leave the club because of his parents' job so the coach said 'if no one is in goal, we can't play'. So at the beginning, we just swapped so I went in goal and then I started to like it. I liked the balance between being the hero and being the 'boo man' or 'boo woman'.""My dad wasn't happy about it, he said 'you have so much talent being an outfield player'. Then we had a small test on the asphalt, and we stood face to face and he said 'fall on your right side' and I did it because your dad is saying it.""There was no grass and I stood up and then did it on the other side. Then he was like 'OK, I'm fine, you can be a goalkeeper'.""I was running to my mum saying 'dad is going crazy, I had to fall down with no grass and I had no protection' and she asked him what he was doing. He said 'I was making sure she was falling in the right way otherwise she's going to get hurt and that's definitely what we do not want to happen'.""Since that time, he's been the best supporter and the best family I could ever imagine to have.""Now in her fourth season at Arsenal, Zinsberger is proving to be one of the best goalkeepers in the WSL. She feels that her calming presence behind the defence can help them do their job, and despite vast development since arriving from Bayern Munich in 2019, is still targeting improvements.""It's about my presence on the pitch,"" Zinsberger said. ""I'm giving the team calmness, I communicate with my defence as much as possible, how do we go on goal kicks, taking responsibility, trying to step up in hard situations in the game, like taking crosses. There, you can show in actions that you are taking responsibility.""I have grown and sometimes I'm a quiet leader and not talking that much, sometimes I'm just trying to read my players and figure out how they are doing and what we can take out of any situation.""I think it's also about my footwork. I'm trying to be active and help them, I'm not trying to hide myself, I'm there like 'you need me, I need you so we have to keep working together', so I think it's a mix of all of them. You need a real presence behind the team so they don't have to look back, they know they have a strong goalkeeper without even looking. That is what I've shown to them in the last few years and the team needs someone they can trust without looking.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player""When I joined Arsenal, I didn't even think about how much potential was left in myself. It's not even about being a football player on the pitch, it's also about the physical part, the psychology part, the personality, the mental health, the nutrition.""I made a plan for myself of how do I get better as quickly as possible, but still being patient. So I took my boxes and had one for 'football', 'mental health and 'nutrition' and got better and that made me the person I am today.""It's been incredible and I'm really happy with how my development has gone at Arsenal, but I'm still trying to work hard and I'm not done. I want to go until the end with Arsenal and we will see at the end of the season how my fourth year has been and we can summarise it in a better way.""Other than that, I'm quite satisfied - could have won more titles, but at least I got one, but at the end of the season, I might have another one.""This weekend sees Arsenal return to the Emirates Stadium as they take on Manchester United in the WSL, live on Sky Sports. The club's hierarchy is making a concerted effort to play more women's games at the men's ground - all of their Champions League group games are being played at the Emirates.For Zinsberger, she enjoys any opportunity to visit the impressive stadium, saying: ""I love the Emirates Stadium. I love it. I really love watching [football] there and also playing on the pitch.""It's still mind-blowing. I could never have imagined I would play at the Emirates. It's still a great achievement and a great appreciation of the club as well that we can keep pushing the women's game forward so we can play as many games as possible at the Emirates.""The atmosphere is great when it's filled up with fans and having the 12th player on the pitch. I can't wait to play on the pitch again and more often.""Man Utd have kept pace with the Gunners for much of the season, although defeat to Chelsea before the international break sees them sit three points behind in third place. Man Utd will have a point to prove as they look to be true title contenders this season, and Zinsberger is not underestimating the challenge.""They have done great since the beginning of the season,"" she said of this weekend's opponents. ""Never underestimate Manchester United, the whole team, it's impressive what they have achieved, how they work against the ball, with the ball.""Mary Earps, she has kept as many clean sheets as I have and she is having a great performance since the Euros, and also before, plus the team has done great. It'll be a really good game at the Emirates, and it's pushing the women's game forward.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player""But I don't want to focus too much on Man United. I'm not going to underestimate them, but it's about us. I can't influence Man United, I can only influence my part in the game, with the team, but also as individuals.""So we have to work hard, putting our [Arsenal] badge in front and saying we are working together, doing our things right and if we're doing that, Man Utd are going to be tough. But if we are doing our things right, hopefully I can keep a clean sheet and we are going to win the game, but it definitely won't be easy.""But this is the game you are waiting for and especially having it at Emirates, it makes it such a great environment. It's a great atmosphere, so many fans can come and watch and it's the next step of keeping women's football going. It's a great game on Saturday and everyone should come and watch!""Super 6 is going International! Could you win £100,000 for free? Entries by 1pm Monday.

Suddenly, in the game, I thought 'that's it' - not in the way that we should stop, but to keep going [after the first goal]."", ""It's not just Arsenal where Zinsberger shines. She is also No 1 for Austria, where she grew up in a small village 'of around 350 people', she estimates.Actually, the 27-year-old followed in the footsteps of her dad, who also played as a goalkeeper - apologising to him after joking that he was not as good as she is. Like female footballers in the UK, she grew up playing with boys in Austria, and a lack of goalkeeper on her team as a youngster saw her rotate into the position.However, it did not prove to be a popular choice with her parents, although they have of course since become her biggest supporters and cheerleaders."", ' she recalled.', ""She said 'why are you not joining? Come with me, have a look and if you want to try it out, you can'. When we arrived there, the boys started practising and I was sitting with the mum on the bench and she said 'are you not interested to just try it out' and I wanted to."", ""I was an outfield player until I was nine and then the goalkeeper had to leave the club because of his parents' job so the coach said 'if no one is in goal, we can't play'. So at the beginning, we just swapped so I went in goal and then I started to like it. I liked the balance between being the hero and being the 'boo man' or 'boo woman'."", ""There was no grass and I stood up and then did it on the other side.

21,WSL Preview: Aston Villa Women v Arsenal,Arsenal.com,,2022-12-10,https://www.arsenal.com/news/wsl-preview-aston-villa-women-v-arsenal,"This menu is keyboard accessible. To open a menu item's submenu, press the space bar. To close a submenu press the escape key.Our Gunners will be looking to bag our eighth win of the Women's Super League season as we travel to Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon. Boosted by our 1-0 victory over Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday evening, an in-form Vivianne Miedema joins a squad bouncing back from injuries on the journey to Villa Park. All the action kicks off at 4.15pm (UK time) and is available to watch live on Sky Sports. 






Currently sitting in fifth place in the WSL table, Carla Ward's side have made a considerable improvement to last season's form. Villa have already won two of their four home matches in the WSL this season, which is more victories than they managed at home for the entirety of the previous campaign (W1 D2 L8).Their opening day victory over Manchester City was followed by a win over struggling Leicester City and they have yet to record a draw in the league. More recently, however, the Villans lost 5-0 to Manchester United in front of an impressive crowd at Old Trafford.

Women: Aston Villa (h) - Highlights


Women: Aston Villa (h) - HighlightsThe last time we met Villa, we put seven past them at Meadow Park in May 2022. A brace from Vivianne Miedema, alongside goals from Beth Mead, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Stina Blackstenius, and Nikita Paris made it for one to forget for the Villans. We ran out 4-0 winners last time around at Villa Park, with Kim Little, Mana Iwabuchi, and Katie McCabe all on the scoresheet. Our captain scored her 150th and 151st club goals and McCabe memorably beat Hannah Hampton from 40 yards out to secure a win.






Rachel Daly made her return to the Women's Super League in style, bagging two goals against Manchester City on her debut for Aston Villa. With eight goals so far this season, Daly is tied for top scorer with City's Bunny Shaw.She has scored each of Villa’s last five goals in the league, with those strikes spread across their last four games.






Leah Williamson and Rafaelle Souza remain fit and both made appearances in our last game against Juventus.Lina Hurtig returned to full team training this week after an injury sustained against Leicester, but Eidevall did not suggest that the Swedish winger would be in the matchday squad at the weekend: ""Lina and Kim are progressing, but I think the Villa game will come a little too early for both.""






Eidevall on Villa: ""I think they were progressing [during] the whole spring. We played very well in that game when we won at home at Boreham Wood in the spring but, before that game, they were a really strong team and were really close to getting points at Chelsea. It went to the last minutes of that game before it was decided.""We have massive respect for Aston Villa. We see them as one of the teams developing most in the league and Carla Ward is doing a tremendous job there. We know that they will be motivated, they will be ready for Sunday and we need to match that.""

Lia Walti snapped into a tackle inside our half before feeding Miedema, who embarked on a fine solo run before stinging Hannah Hampton’s palms.We went close from the resulting corner, with Rafaelle nodding over after Hampton had misjudged the flight of the ball.Seconds later, though, we were behind. Impressive link play between Rachel Daly and Kenza Dali resulted in the latter freeing Hanson, whose powerful shot from the edge of the area found the far corner.We were straight back on the front foot after the early setback and almost went level when brilliant build-up play from Miedema created a chance for Caitlin Foord, who shot over.Both sides continued to threaten in an entertaining opening - McCabe’s 25-yard free-kick flew inches over at one end, Laura Blindkilde’s cross rattled our crossbar at the other.Having gone close to an equaliser, McCabe was instrumental in our equaliser. Our captain for the day was involved in neat interplay around the Villa box before seeing her low cross diverted just over the line following a double deflection, with Corsie getting the final touch.Soon after, we were in front. Hampton could only punch a corner out to Miedema, who volleyed home from eight yards.Stina Blackstenius went close with a header as we continued to look dangerous before the break.We didn't have to wait too long to extend our lead after half-time - McCabe firing home from close range after Steph Catley’s cross was touched into her path by Hampton.Carla Ward sent on Emily Gielnik as Villa searched for a route back into the game - but we continued to look the more threatening and almost extended our lead further when Blackstenius’ looping header from Williamson’s deep cross was hacked off the line.We added gloss to the scoreline late on - Foord driving towards goal before squaring to substitute Nobbs, who finished emphatically from close range to put the seal on a convincing display.The win saw us move level on points with Chelsea at the top of the WSL, ahead of Emma Hayes’ side’s match against Reading.Our next league match is against our title rivals, at Emirates Stadium on January 15 - but before then we have two Women’s Champions League matches, at home to Lyon on Thursday and away at FC Zurich on Wednesday, December 21.Arsenal: Zinsberger, Maritz (Wienroither 71), Wubben-Moy, Rafaelle (Williamson 60), Catley, Walti, Maanum, McCabe (c), Blackstenius, Foord (Iwabuchi 86), Miedema (Nobbs 72)Unused subs: Marckese, Beattie, AgyemangAston Villa: Hampton, Mayling, Corsie, Turner, Pacheco, McLoughlin (Gielnik 66), Blindkilde, Dali, Lehmann (Goodwin 86), Hanson, DalyUnused subs: Leat, KeitleyCopyright 2022 The Arsenal Football Club plc.

24,Grass-roots football craves more than a Euro boost,Telegraph.co.uk,"Tom Garry, Molly McElwee",2022-11-28,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2022/11/28/grass-roots-football-craves-euro-boost/,"
England’s win led to a flood of interest, but below the elite level, the game is battling
England’s Euros triumph at Wembley this summer provided a once-in-a generation chance to grow the women’s game. Four months on, the signs are that interest in women’s and girls’ football is continuing to soar, amid a flurry of record attendances across the pyramid. However, scratch beneath the surface and it is clear more needs to be done, with many issues still to be resolved, not least around facilities and accessibility.As the Government embarks on a review of the entire women’s game, chaired by England icon Karen Carney, we ask how the game can make the most of the surge in popularity.Women’s Super League crowds have soared to an average of 6,227, including a new WSL-best turnout of 47,367 for September’s north London derby. On Sunday, Sheffield United obliterated the record for the Women’s Championship, the second tier, with 11,137 at Bramall Lane.Kelly Chambers, manager of WSL club Reading, who play their home fixtures at the Select Car Leasing Stadium, which they share with Reading’s men, said: “All of us as clubs and the FA knew the biggest thing we wanted to try and change this year was getting [more] fans in the door and trying to build that fan base. It needs to keep growing.”Two-thirds of top-flight teams are averaging more than 3,400 fans this term, and Arsenal have averaged nearly 24,000, thanks to playing two league games at the Emirates Stadium.Speaking after her side’s loss to Chelsea in front of 38,350 at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, Tottehnam manager Rehanne Skinner said: “It’s great to have these one-off kind of hits but I think the most important thing is that everybody’s average attendance goes up, so still there’s a lot of work to do.”After removing the “big-stadium” matches, the WSL is averaging 2,770 this season, above last season’s figure, which was below 2,000. Chelsea manager Emma Hayes – who says women’s football tickets are “too cheap” – believes WSL clubs are “all outgrowing our small stadiums”, with the 46-year-old adding that she would like to see teams playing between eight and 12 games per year at their men’s team’s home.It is not just at the elite level where facilities are a key part of the discussion about how to grow the game. For some, access to a regular pitch of any kind is hard.Bex Francis-Jones, a former captain of Manchester United Women, knows that feeling well. She is involved in the heartbeat of the grass-roots level, as both player and chairperson at Northwich Vixens LFC. The club are run entirely by volunteers – with even former Wales international Dean Saunders among those to have offered coaching services. The Cheshire club play in the North West Women’s Regional League Division One South, the sixth tier of the pyramid. Players pay to play – £20 per month, as well as a £30 signing-on-fee – but have their kit provided, thanks to local sponsors.“We’re always wanting to progress, we’re just struggling to grow any bigger because of a lack of facilities,” Francis-Jones says. “In Northwich, there aren’t enough facilities for the teams.”Francis-Jones has been the club’s chair for around 10 years, and says extra interest since the Euros has enabled a new Wildcats – an FA participation scheme for five-to-11-year-old girls – group to set up in Northwich, and they have teams at all age groups.Meanwhile, their first and development teams have pitch-access problems. The Vixens play their home matches in the neighbouring village of Lostock Gralam, sharing the men’s team’s venue, but Francis-Jones says: “It’s a grass pitch and the draining system is diabolical – it’s waterlogged quite often. Then there’s our training pitch – we train on a Wednesday night but only on half a pitch, around 40 players on half a pitch, from 8-10pm. It’s the only slot we can get, but the development team has 16-to-17-year-olds with college, A levels, and some travelling from Altrincham, and they need to leave by 9pm to get to bed to catch college buses at 6am.” She adds that – together with local men’s side Northwich Victoria – they are “actively looking” for land to build on and talking to the Cheshire FA. She adds: “We’re looking to grow a disability team and a walking football team, but we can’t because we haven’t got the facilities.”Last year, when launching a new grass-roots strategy, the FA set a target of adding 5,000 pitches by 2024 and it is understood more than 3,000 have been built.Another concern for many lower-league clubs is the one-up, one-down promotion and relegation system, with more than a dozen coaches from tiers three, four and five saying there are bottlenecks in the pyramid, with teams that want to invest unable to do so without promotion.Fifth-tier Dulwich Hamlet are hosting Gillingham in the Women’s FA Cup second round on Sunday. Their head coach, Ryan Marvin Dempsey, says they have seen an increase in players contacting them for trials, but wants to see more funding trickling down to the grass roots and believes clubs should be rewarded for their investment. “Reshaping the pyramid needs to happen sooner rather than later to help growth,” he says. “In our league, there’s only one team that can get promoted and you’ve got us, Millwall, Fulham, Worthing, Dartford that are putting a lot of infrastructure and support in and only one team can go up. It stunts growth. There are lots of ways you could do it. You could have two go up from each region, and then a play-off from the top two teams in the region.” The FA is understood to be reviewing the structure, including promotion and relegation.Arguably the most important area. England named an entirely white squad of 23 for a friendly in 2021, and only around 10-15 per cent of WSL players represent black, Asian and minority ethnic communities compared with about a third in the Premier League. The issue is not just related to playing squads. Following former England manager Hope Powell’s resignation from Brighton, the managers at all 24 clubs across the top two English women’s divisions are white.Former England and Arsenal striker Ian Wright says: “It’s a systemic problem and we are just dealing with it in incidents. We really need to start dealing with the systemic problem.”The FA is increasing the number of centres of excellence – now known as “Emerging Talent Centres” – for girls’ football across the country to 70. The previous 30 centres were criticised for being predominantly in rural areas and hard to access from inner cities. The FA has also started an initiative called “Discover My Talent”, aiming to provide opportunities to girls from any communities to join the national pathway, and have had 1,622 referrals of school-age youngsters since July 2021.There are shoots of growth but challenges remain.Elsewhere, while big steps remain, shoots of growth are sprouting up around the country as careers in women’s football become more visible and attractive to young people, as Francis-Jones points out. “What the professional status of women’s football has also done is inspire some of our girls to become coaches and referees, because they’re seeing them out there now.”That comes while on television – according to data released by the Women’s Sport Trust this month – WSL television audiences are 1½ times higher than last season, 42 per cent of new viewers are female and young audiences are rising, too.That is partly why Tammy Parlour, the Women’s Sport Trust chief executive and co-founder, is optimistic that the game can thrive, but says it must not rest on its laurels. “I definitely feel that the success of the Euros [means] we’re entering this new era, but momentum is not guaranteed, there’s still lots that we need to do to drive progress and make sure we see those lasting changes and have an industry that is fully representative of society.”We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions

Arsenal chief executive Vinai Venkatesham says the club's long-term ambition is for the women's team to share Emirates Stadium permanently with the men's side.Speaking ahead of Saturday's Women's Super League match against Manchester United at the Emirates, for which Arsenal have sold approximately 40,000 tickets, Venkatesham told Telegraph Sport that the club feels a ""sense of responsibility"" to help grow the women's game.Arsenal Women's usual home is Boreham Wood FC's Meadow Park but they set a new WSL record when 47,367 fans watched the 4-0 derby win over Tottenham at the Emirates in September, with the game against United likely to be the division's second-highest ever attendance.""The long-term vision is for Emirates Stadium to be the home of Arsenal Women and the home of Arsenal men,"" Venkatesham said in an exclusive interview with Telegraph Sport. ""It's hard to put a timeline on it and it's hard to know for sure if and how we'll achieve it, but that has to be the vision.""I'm not going to pretend for a moment it's straightforward to get there – there are questions around 'how do you handle it operationally, how to deal with fixture clashes? How do you deal with making sure that pitch is in tip-top quality? How can you be sure the demand is there?' But that's the ambition, that's where we need to get to.""It won't be easy. There are challenges and it won't be linear. But when you you see the types of demand that we saw for Spurs [at home in September], the demand that we see for the Manchester United game, and we also see in Borehamwood that we increasingly sell out that stadium, it gives us more confidence that we can get there.""The quality of the sport is so fantastic at the moment and when you're able to put it on that platform, it's great for the players, it’s great for the broadcast product, it looks great on TV being played in full, big stadiums. ""And it’s great for commercial partners to drive their interest – that's really important because ultimately one of the things we need to do in women's football is to make the game more sustainable, because that will encourage more people to set up women's teams or more clubs to invest more in women's football and that's what will secure a stable and vibrant future for the women's game.""Jonas Eidevall's Arsenal side played at the Emirates four times last season and then – before England's Euros success – the club took the decision to increase that to a minimum of six games there this term.""The reason we wanted to do that is we think it's a great opportunity to just increase the number of people that get the opportunity to see Arsenal Women play live,"" said Venkatesham, who confirmed all tickets allocated for Saturday's game have been sold, with none given away for free as has sometimes been the case in the women's game in the past.""First and foremost, it's a massive game on Saturday, first plays third, both Arsenal and Manchester United have started the season really well,"" he added.""It's such an exciting time for women's football, and as a club we really feel like it's our responsibility, given our history and heritage and our standing in the game, to be on the forefront of this new era for women's football.""You can read the full, exclusive interview with Arsenal's CEO in November's edition of our monthly Women's Sport supplement, in Thursday's Daily Telegraph.We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions

Plus: Reading's start to the WSL season and Northern Ireland's landmark 2022 after Euro 2022 debut; Watch Chelsea Women vs Reading Women on Sunday from 6.30pm, live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event
          Senior football journalist
      Sunday 11 December 2022 11:04, UKSport has always been a part of Jacqueline Burns' life. At school, she played hockey, netball and athletics to a high level, competing internationally. In fact, football was one of the last activities she tried out.""I started football around eight years old with a boys team at a development centre,"" she said ahead of Reading's trip to Chelsea in the WSL on Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event.""We were doing a rotation game where you try out all the positions and I went in as goalkeeper and never came out.""But she soon reached a point where a decision had to be made on which sport to focus on. Many female players have made the same move to play at colleges in the USA, and Burns credits her time at Carson-Newman University in Tennessee for preparing her for a step up to the professional game.""When I was making the decision to go America, I was still playing hockey and netball and still doing a bit of the athletics,"" she explained.""So when I was given the opportunity to go America, it was like 'this is where you have to focus down on one sport'. I picked football and it gave me the chance to focus down on it and really want to be good at it and progress on with it.""Going to America got me prepared for the professional game because you always hear that going there, it's like being treated like a professional, especially at collegiate level.

            ""Going out there, you were treated like an athlete because you were training every day and revolving your time around the sport and the school just fell into place as well. So being able to have that mindset from 18 or 19, going into a professional environment, then bringing that back and building on it to now, it's really helped.""I was a young adult and I wanted to get my independence as well so moving away to America, I couldn't have thought of a further place to go. I wanted to see how I would develop as a person.""The first few months were hard because you're so used to being with your family and depending on them. That helped me be a better person and then being able to be more independent.""Just being able to experience different countries, it's something you want to experience when you're younger before you have to think about the bigger picture and where you want to end up. I think I've given myself a range of 'I'll be more comfortable here or there'.""After graduating in 2019, Burns trod another well-worn female footballer path as she returned to Northern Ireland, signing with Glentoran in the NI Football League Women's Premiership while working a full-time job.The time in Belfast allowed her to rest and reset before another year in the USA at Lee University, also in Tennessee, to complete her Masters degree.She said: ""When I moved back, I didn't really know what I wanted to do then. So I got an ordinary job and then started off with Glentoran in Belfast. Then I sort of thought there wasn't much fulfilment with that so I think the year being back was more of a recharge year and getting myself back to where I wanted to be.""I was fortunate to go back out to America for another year so having something to be able to prepare for, being back in Belfast, I was able to get myself mentally and physically in the right shape to then know what I was going back out to in America because I'd already experienced it.""Everyone always looks forward to playing the big names so I think it’s going to be great to go out and play against a big team like Chelsea for what they are.


""With every game, we’re going to go into it and prepare as much as we can , just play our own game and hopefully something comes out of it.""""But this time, it was more of a pinnacle point because I was going to fulfil my last year as a full-time athlete there. Then from there, I knew I was going to be in the right environment to push on and see where that would take me to the next level.""It was during a short spell at BK Hacken in Sweden that Reading approached Burns. The interest gave her a pre-Euros boost and she eventually signed with the club in August this year.""With any team, you're a bit shocked whenever you get told there is an interest because you don't really know how to take it,"" Burns recalled. ""I was coming out of kind of a tough time in Sweden because it was another challenge, but to have an interest you were like 'this is big'.""Reading have always been in the top league and were always a team that you knew and being able to have that interest was special.""Going into a big tournament that I had this year, it was reassuring to have that interest. That was something that really stood out to me, they had that interest before anything happened and they knew who I was and my capabilities.""It just so happens that the tournament went well and it made it so much better. Just having that actual focus from before the Euros, it made the choice easier.""Kelly [Chambers] has been around for a long time and I think just knowing her and the club, it's a club that's always consentient from where they're at during each year. That's been important for me to be involved with a team that shows development and shows consistency. That's what made the decision easy to come here at the end.""Reading have had a slow start to the 2022/23 campaign, but one of the club and Burns' highlights came against Tottenham last weekend. The Royals won 1-0, taking them to seven points, well clear of Leicester in 12th place.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player""The start has been a bit of a bump, a bit shaky but I think we've shown in every game that we've developed and we've improved,"" Burns reflected.""With every game, you can see an improvement in each player and a positive uplift in each player. It's something that you see with everyone and it's contagious because once one player starts to feel good, it passes onto another one and it's boosted the squad from having a bit of a slump. It's been something that's been good to see.""We played Tottenham in the Conti Cup and it was a bit more of a one-sided game at the start [Spurs were 3-1 winners], but we knew we weren't far off them.""We prepared well for the game at the weekend and we came into it maybe with a bit of hesitancy because of everything that went on in the squad that week with flu outbreaks and what not.""I talked about it with a couple of the girls after, I think the result came because of the togetherness of the team and the willingness to keep going, even if we maybe didn't have a fully healthy squad. If we show that there with an unhealthy squad and if everyone's together, I think that's going to push us on even more.""""Goalkeeping is really hard so it’s one of those positions where you’re down to the nitty-gritty kind of stuff.


""Even coming here, it’s been a big change in terms of how the goalkeepers are seen and that’s something that I’ve been striving towards, getting down to those small details because that can be the difference between a save and a goal.


""In terms of the bigger picture, it’s planning that future in terms of maybe coaching and going along that route, just to get myself prepared for the life outside of football.


""I know it’s easy to say in a few years, I could still be playing but you just don’t know what’s going to happen. Looking at the coaching aspect is something I really want to focus in on.""Not only has this year seen Burns make the move to Reading, but also taking part in Northern Ireland's first major tournament at Euro 2022. She started in every game as Kenny Shiels' side made their mark on the international stage.Despite being knocked out in the group stages, it was a celebratory atmosphere after the final match against England at St Mary's and Burns credited the travelling fans for helping the team.""I think we've still been reflecting on it,"" she said. ""We just loved the moment and being in the moment and that's something we all emphasised, that we don't want to overlook this because it's something that is special to everyone.""This was our first major tournament and maybe some girls might not be able to do that again in the future, but we just showed what we are. We go and celebrate with our fans because a few years ago, we wouldn't have had that. Even when we were in the play-offs, we didn't have that crowd behind us because of Covid.""So for us to actually have a crowd, it makes it extra special for us. There's such a small crowd of them, but they make such a big noise. We do take a lot of pride in our fans and we love every single one of them.""For us, as a team, we always like to show our appreciation to them after games because they've come out to support us and for them to be cheering for 90 minutes plus, it gets us through the game and to acknowledge them, it's the minimum we can do for them.""We have seen a positive impact of it because a lot of young girls are coming to more games. We played Italy at the previous camp and we had a great crowd at that again and it just shows we're having a positive impact with what's come from the Euros.""We're hoping it's not just a one-time thing for us and we're actually going to be able to build on it. Our manager now is looking at the bigger picture - what we're going to do in the future, how he wants to impact for planning ahead and for the younger generation coming through.""I think that's something that's been important for us is to plan for the future and we're doing a good job, I think.""Watch Chelsea Women vs Reading Women in the Women's Super League on Sunday from 6.30pm, live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event.Make yourself a millionaire with Super 6.

                                    Rachel Furness’ stoppage-time header salvaged a 3-3 draw for Liverpool FC Women at Brighton & Hove Albion Women.
                                Missy Bo Kearns put the Reds ahead in Sunday’s Barclays Women’s Super League contest at Broadfield Stadium, but Brighton responded strongly and led 3-1 at the break.Half-time substitute Shanice van de Sanden pulled one back for Matt Beard’s side and, as the clock ticked past 90 minutes, Taylor Hinds hit the crossbar from distance before Van de Sanden turned provider for Furness.The Dutch forward surged down the right and sent in an excellent cross, which a stooping Furness planted home firmly to snatch an important point for the visitors.Having absorbed an early spell of Brighton pressure, it was Liverpool who went in front thanks to Kearns.Melissa Lawley’s direct, incisive run down the left took her to the byline and Kearns had broken forward from midfield to convert the No.11’s delivery with a first-time finish.That advantage was quickly overturned, though, with the hosts striking twice in the space of four minutes.Elisabeth Terland’s glancing header from Katie Robinson’s cross drew Brighton level, before Danielle Carter sent WSL debutant Eartha Cumings – in goal with Rachael Laws out injured – the wrong way from the penalty spot after Jasmine Matthews had been penalised for handball. And, soon after the half-hour mark, Brighton got a third as Robinson’s attempted ball in from the right drifted over Cumings and into the net.Van de Sanden’s introduction at the break provided some additional attacking impetus and the Netherlands international’s first goal since her summer return to the club was just reward for the Reds’ best period of the match.Former Brighton defender Emma Koivisto had just forced Megan Walsh into an excellent, full-stretch stop and, a couple of minutes later, she hooked in a cross that Van de Sanden nodded in at the back post.Liverpool had a quarter of an hour plus stoppage time to find an equaliser and there was to be late, late drama, as first Hinds went agonisingly close before Furness snapped a five-game losing streak in the WSL in the 92nd minute.LFC Women: Cumings, Koivisto (Roberts, 90), Flaherty, Fahey (Wardlaw, 69), Campbell (Holland, 38), Hinds, Kearns (Furness, 69), Matthews, Lawley, Daniels (Van de Sanden, 46), Stengel.Unused subs: Kirby, Robe, Humphrey.",[]

Courtney Sweetman-Kirk challenges football to show a genuine desire to improve representation in elite girls' and women's football and describes England star Beth Mead's recent comments about the lack of diversity in the squad as ""probably a bit ill-informed and a bit uneducated.""By Dev Trehan & Anton Toloui Tuesday 15 November 2022 11:50, UKPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerCourtney Sweetman-Kirk says football must show ""a genuine desire for change"" to tackle the lack of diversity in elite girls' and women's football.Sweetman-Kirk's comments come after England manager Sarina Wiegman told Sky Sports News before Friday's 4-0 win over Japan she ""would love to see more Black players in the team"".England named three mixed-Black heritage players in their Women's Euros squad this summer but fielded an all-white starting XI in every match of their stunning tournament triumph, reigniting the debate over the lack of ethnic diversity in elite girls' and women's football. According to the PFA, just 9.7 per cent of footballers in the elite women's game are from diverse ethnic backgrounds, compared to 43 per cent of male players in the Premier League.Wiegman added on Friday: ""We need to do more and we are doing more. The FA is doing more to give access to anyone who wants to play football.""England Women's forward Ella Toone pointed to the open letter to the Government penned by the Lionesses after their Euro 2022 success, asking for girls to have equal access to football in PE lessons, as proof the squad are committed to creating a genuine legacy for women's football.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerToone told Sky Sports News on Sunday. ""A lot more can be done. We want to get as many people as we can involved in football and as many backgrounds as we can.""But Sweetman-Kirk has called for meaningful dialogue with football's stakeholders, insisting there needs to be much greater enthusiasm and energy to really focus on ethnic diversity in the women's game.

            The Sheffield United forward said: ""I think for young girls growing up and looking at that squad, there are a lot of young white girls, which is fine, but in terms of South Asian, mixed race and Black girls looking up and thinking 'I want to be like that', they've not got many role models to look up to.""There needs to be a desire for change and actually to open up a conversation.""There needs to be change. We need to have these discussions. People almost need to be allowed in a way to be wrong because it's easy to jump on people but sometimes to open yourself up to that conversation, you need to almost be a little bit wrong and have room to be educated.""So we need to have these conversations. We need to make sure that we want to do something about it.""But after that, whether it be the England Women, or whether we are talking about Kick It Out or taking the knee - we always see these sorts of things happening and these conversations had - but what is the action behind it?""We spoke about Yanks (Rachel Yankey), Anita Asante - these historic England females who have been involved in The Game. If I'm the FA, I'm getting them involved.""I'm talking to Alex Scott, talking to Rachel Yankey, talking to Anita Asante, Lianne Sanderson as well - who is a fantastic advocate for the game - to say 'Right, where are we going?

What do you think the barriers are facing those communities and how can we change that?'.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player""Hopefully, those discussions are being had.""The Football Association has been approached for comment but was unable to provide any ethnicity data on diverse representation within girls' and women's elite pathways when recently contacted by Sky Sports News.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe FA said its key aims are to provide greater access for more players while diversifying the talent pool, pointing to its Discover My Talent initiative and referring Sky Sports News to its Inspiring Positive Change strategy update Asian Inclusion Strategy update and wider Diversity and Inclusion strategy.England's Beth Mead defended herself after the win over Japan over comments attributed to her in an interview with The Guardian in which she was quoted as saying the lack of ethnic diversity in the England Women squad was ""a coincidence"".Mead, who won her 50th cap in the game and has since withdrawn from the squad due to family circumstances, told Sky Sports News the article was ""unfair"" and not a ""true reflection"" of herself.Prior to her response, Arsenal legend and ITV pundit Ian Wright said there is a systemic problem in the women's game, adding he had spoken with Mead about her comments, which were described by former England international and fellow pundit Eni Aluko as ""clumsy"".""I'm very fond of Beth,"" Wright said in the studio. ""Yes, it was a bit disappointing seeing that. What was said will obviously stay between us but I think it was a massive moment of reflection and learning for her.""Sweetman-Kirk said Mead's comments at best were ""probably a bit ill-informed and a bit uneducated"" because of the systemic racism and inequalities that plague the girls' and women's game.Sky Sports News pundit Clinton Morrison added: ""This always come up when a comment comes up. We should be talking about this nearly every day to try and change it.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player""It's always the same. This stuff has come up because of Beth Mead's comments.

                                    An impressive Liverpool FC Women performance delivered a 2-0 victory over West Ham United on Sunday afternoon.
                                Goals from Ceri Holland and Katie Stengel highlighted a dominant Reds display during a first half at Prenton Park in which they created a host of chances.A more even contest ensued past the break but Matt Beard’s charges saw it out to bag three points in the Barclays Women’s Super League.It was an especially notable day for Reds captain Niamh Fahey too, the centre-back reaching the milestone of 100 appearances for the club.Unbeaten in their last three matches coming into the game, Liverpool built on that recent momentum by taking a third-minute lead.Holland pounced on hesitancy inside the West Ham penalty area from Gilly Flaherty’s forward pass and beat the outrushing goalkeeper to the ball, which she prodded high inside the left post for 1-0.Beard’s team wasted little time in trying to build on the breakthrough and Megan Campbell’s trademark long throw-in created two chances in quick succession.From a right-flank launch into the area, the ball fell to Melissa Lawley, whose effort was dragged low across the goal, struck Flaherty and drifted over into the stands.Another chance swiftly followed, Fahey flicking on Campbell’s throw from the left touchline this time and Flaherty’s touch-and-shot looping too high to trouble the Hammers.Emma Koivisto’s finish was repelled by Mackenzie Arnold when Shanice van de Sanden’s low cross was only half-cleared, but a second Liverpool goal seemed inevitable.And it arrived on 20 minutes as Taylor Hinds’ drive from distance was deflected kindly into the path of Stengel. The striker controlled the loose ball with one touch and guided it into the bottom corner with another, her sixth WSL goal of 2022-23.They were close to a third before the break, with Arnold having to claw away a lovely, curling effort from Holland and Stengel hooking a shot over from Flaherty’s knockdown into a good position.It continued to be largely one-way traffic upon the restart for the second half and West Ham had to clear away a swerving strike by Lawley that was on course for the net.The No.11 turned provider soon after, swooping a right-to-left cross that teed up Van de Sanden, whose attempt fell the wrong side of the back post.The visitors began to enjoy more possession as the minutes ticked away and Rachael Laws had to be alert off her line to mop up when Lisa Evans got past Campbell and bore down on goal.Flaherty produced an excellent block inside the box to thwart the same Hammers player’s blast at goal after an incisive attack along their left-hand side.And Laws was called into action as Evans’ cross into the middle found Dagny Brynjarsdottir for a shot that took a touch off the recovering Hinds and was palmed out by the Liverpool goalkeeper.Substitute Yana Daniels saw a late diving header pushed off target, but the Reds saw out the 2-0 score and registered their second victory of the campaign in the Women’s Super League.LFC Women: Laws, Koivisto, Fahey, Flaherty, Campbell (Daniels, 80), Hinds (Roberts, 87), Matthews, Holland, Van de Sanden (Kearns, 62), Lawley, Stengel.Unused substitutes: Cumings, Robe, Wardlaw, Furness, Humphrey, Silcock.",[]

LFC


                                    Katie Stengel has been named Liverpool FC Women's Standard Chartered Player of the Month for September and October.
                                The striker led the line impressively for the Reds, scoring three goals in the Barclays Women’s Super League, including a memorable opening-day double to defeat champions Chelsea, and another in the Continental League Cup.The 30-year-old American finished ahead of Ceri Holland and Missy Bo Kearns in our Player of the Month poll and was presented with the special Futuremakers by Standard Chartered trophy ahead of Sunday’s trip to Brighton & Hove Albion Women.“I’m pleased, though of course we’d have liked a few more points in this period,” Stengel told Liverpoolfc.com as she collected the prize.“But I think it’s still important to put out the performances and I’m proud the way the girls have continued to fight and hopefully we can come away with a big win this weekend.“The WSL is a much more challenging league and it tests a lot of our character because it’s easy when things are going well and you’re winning, now you have to see who can perform week in, week out.“We’ve a big test ahead of us for the rest of the season and hopefully we can come away with a performance we’re proud of each weekend and continue to build throughout the year.”",[]

See our ethics statement.Liverpool FC Women dropped points late Thursday against struggling Reading, who came from behind to equalize in stoppage time. The Reds had gone up early, but had to come from behind in the second half to go into second half stoppage time 3-2 up. Conceding so late was “frustrating” for manager Matt Beard, who believed his team “should have been out of sight.”At the end of the day, the draw was another performance where the result belied the overall quality of play. Reading held the Reds to just one goal in the first half despite Liverpool’s productive chance creation. At the end of the match, Reading had pulled equal, with 17 shots (seven on target) to Liverpool’s 16 shots — and the Reds will be disappointing that they managed to put just a quarter of these shots on target.Speaking postmatch, Beard gave voice to the side’s disappointment speaking to Liverpoolfc.com:We are frustrated not to get all three points, especially after we went back in front and then conceding in the 88th minute.“Crosses and set-pieces were a problem for us tonight and we knew Reading are dangerous from them, so that was super-disappointing.“I was really pleased with the character after going 2-1 down and then getting back in front, but obviously we are frustrated we have not managed to see the game out and take all three points.“It is an important point on the road, but I thought we should have been out of sight with the chances we had in the first half, being perfectly honest with you.”Of course, the Reds will be targeting simply staying up this season, their first back in the Women’s Super League. It is certainly important to take these frustrating results with that goal in mind: Liverpool currently sit five points above the relegation spot, and are in 10th. Beard is confident that his side should have enough to stay up and to improve their position, particularly in the present context:“It’s a tough league and we feel we have the quality in this squad to stay in this division. “It’s tough to pick up points away from home in this league and we have had two long journeys in four days, so another point on board was vitally important.“We have got two games at home now in the WSL and we need to try to take maximum points against West Ham United and Leicester City.“We want to consolidate and keep moving forward so as long as we keep creating chances like we did tonight then I’m confident we will be OK.”Check your inbox for a welcome email.Oops.

Arsenal Women play their final WSL game of 2022, as they travel to the Midlands to face 5th placed Aston Villa at Villa Park. Here are three things to watch for. Rachel Daly was Aston Villa’s big summer signing, and one who has put Villa at the top of the rest of the WSL. Broadly speaking, the midtable of the WSL have teams that are well-organized and have a good defensive shape. The big difference between Aston Villa, Tottenham, and Everton is that Aston Villa have a striker who scores goals. Rachel Daly was often prolific in the NWSL, with Houston, and she’s the joint top scorer in the WSL this season, with 8 goals, albeit with 3 from the penalty spot. Still, 5 non-penalty goals puts her level with Sam Kerr (and Frida Maanum). Daly can drop deep to knit play, but she feasts on crosses, with service coming from Alisha Lehmann and Kirsty Hanson. Kenza Dalí joined in the summer and has added creativity to Villa’s midfield. Villa are third in the WSL in crosses into the penalty area per game, with Hanson, Lehmann and right back Sarah Mayling playing the most per game. Mayling is also Villa’s top progresser from the back. Arsenal have had a tactical rejig in recent weeks. With Beth Mead out and Lina Hurtig out, and Mana Iwabuchi not favoured, Katie McCabe has been the right winger almost by default, as soon as she wasn’t required at left back. McCabe plays as an inverted winger on the right hand side, which is contrary to how Beth Mead plays on the right. McCabe will act almost as a third central midfielder or #10, which allows Vivianne Miedema to push higher up. As a result, there’s space on the right hand side. On Wednesday, Stina Blackstenius exploited that space to set up Miedema’s winner against Juventus, with Blackstenius’ cross set up by a dink from Leah Williamson. Williamson is unlikely to start, having started midweek, but Rafaelle Souza should return. Rafaelle has the ability to play diagonals, but also plays longer passes down the wing or into the channel. Stina Blackstenius assisted Vivianne Miedema’s winner against Juventus, but she hasn’t scored in over a month for Arsenal, last netting against Leicester City. In this four match scoreless run, Blackstenius has had chances, but just hasn’t been able to convert, with an xG from the four games of 1.6. Shots haven’t been lacking; she’s taken 13, and has been somewhat unlucky, having hit the woodwork, but Arsenal will need her to find her scoring boots again. Essentially, the underlying numbers are fine, but with two crucial games after Villa, against Lyon and Zurich in the Champions League, a goal for Blackstenius would be very valuable heading into the final stretch of matches in the year. Player to watch: Laura WienroitherLaura Wienroither has wrestled the starting right back role from Noëlle Maritz, and has done nothing to cede the role. There’s a new challenge for Wienroither now, though; with McCabe ahead of her, there’s more space for Wienroither, but also more passing and creative responsibility. One thing Wienroither is very good at doing is being a direct player, including getting into the attacking and final third. With Arsenal’s switches of play, that could be a route to goal, with build-up play down the left.Predicted lineup (4231): 1. Zinsberger; 26. Wienroither, 3. Wubben-Moy, 2. Rafaelle Souza, 7. Catley; 12. Maanum, 13. Wälti; 15. McCabe, 11. Miedema, 19. Foord; 25. BlacksteniusSubstitutes: 18. Marckese, 5. Beattie, 6. Williamson, 8. Nobbs, 16. Maritz, 23. Iwabuchi, 59.

40,Arsenal Debate: How should the Women handle the rapid expansion in fans and interest?,Just Arsenal News,Michelle,2022-11-22,https://www.justarsenal.com/womens-super-league-with-growing-crowds-come-growing-pains-for-arsenal-other-teams/324137,"Women’s Super League: with growing crowds come growing pains for Arsenal & other teams By MichelleThis weekend saw the Women’s Super League take the spotlight in English football, with the Premier League on international break for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and the England team beginning their campaign on Monday lunchtime, with a 6-2 win over Iran.The WSL produced some spectacular football – Manchester United’s thrilling late comeback to defeat Arsenal 2-3 at Emirates, the fast-paced 3-3 draw between Liverpool and Brighton, and some great football as reigning WSL champions Chelsea beat Spurs 3-0.The WSL also drew in impressive crowds.  Chelsea women broke their home attendance record as they played at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2019.  More than 40,000 supporters were at Emirates Stadium on Saturday evening as Arsenal hosted Man Utd Women.The Championship saw some good attendance too as Sheffield United Women drew a record crowd of 11,137 to Bramall Lane for their 2-0 defeat to London City Lionesses.But how do we do this on a consistent basis and turn occasional fans into dedicated supporters who follow the WSL clubs week in and week out?With growing crowds come growing pains..  Chelsea’s home, Kingsmeadow, only has a capacity of 4,850.  Arsenal usually play at Meadow Park, which can hold a capacity of 4,500.The success of the Lionesses at Euro 2022 saw interest in women’s football in England increase dramatically, but WSL teams are generally performing in their usual surroundings, which raises the question of how do we grow attendance when women’s home ground matches are already being sold-out on a regular basis?Let’s take a look at some WSL manager’s views:Arsenal faced Tottenham at the men’s ground earlier this season, winning 4-0 in September in front of a WSL record-breaking crowd of 47,367.  After the match Eidevall said It is so important for growing the game to make sure that these occasions are not one-offs.  If you’re doing that, then I think the chances increase that you can repeat it again because of course, it’s not going to be a sustainable solution to give away tickets for games.  Let’s be honest, football clubs need revenues and ticket sales are important for revenues, he added.Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall said of the Emirates: I think it’s one of our two homes. And from the time I’ve been here, we feel more and more that this is our home.Arsenal play their home Champions League matches at Emirates Stadium this season. While these games have drawn much lower crowds, they are ensuring the women’s club game at England’s biggest stadia is becoming normal.At her post-match press conference on Sunday, Chelsea Manager Emma Hayes said: I’d like to be here [at Stamford Bridge] more.  I think we all know that solving the conundrum in the women’s game around what do we do from small stadia, is there a medium-term plan to go to medium-size stadiums before eventually everyone comes home to the large stadium?  I don’t know, but I’m absolutely certain we’re all outgrowing our small stadiums, that I’m sure of.I think one of the biggest things that perhaps we don’t talk enough about is how cheap women’s football is, Hayes said. I really believe we have to increase the overall pricing structure if we’re to play more in these places, because there is a cost implication to it.I think the audiences are there, not for every game, but certainly for maybe eight games, 12 games a year.  We have to be more ambitious for ourselves.  Is it too cheap to watch women’s football?  I think it is, especially for the top games.Arsenal & Chelsea fans adult tickets generally cost about £8 to £9.  For bigger matches such as Arsenal v Chelsea at Emirates Stadium on 15th January 2023, adult tickets are still only £12.  Tickets are available to purchase here.Reading boss Kelly Chambers, speaking before their 3-1 defeat to Aston Villa, played at Villa Park, she said: Off the back of the Euros, we knew the biggest change we wanted to see happen this year was getting more fans in the door, watching the games but not only that, grow the fanbase too.  It’s all well and good having fans turn up to the stadium every so often, but what we want is to ensure they are embedded into our experience and leave them wanting more.A big change for this weekend’s big stadium matches was away ends.  Usually WSL crowds are mixed, but on Saturday night, the Manchester United players celebrated wildly with their travelling fans.  Manager Mark Skinner said of away ends, after the Arsenal – Man Utd match: Whether it’s concrete proof or not, if you give us away ends you will get a lot of fans through the door.  Tonight was a good indicator of that. We just had to go to them at the end, it was good to know where they were.In summary, there is definitely a conundrum.. everyone wants more bums on seats for WSL games but nobody really has enough seats to put those proverbial bums on..Away ends is a given in men’s football, shouldn’t it be the case in womens – particularly for the big games at least?Ridiculously low prices need to increase, not to exorbitant levels like the men’s game but somewhere above single figures per ticket would be a marked improvement in helping to finance the women’s game.Gooners, your thoughts would be appreciated on this one..Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

As a professional concern Arsenal should be at the forefront of maintaining high playing standards, participation rates and maintaining the Arsenal FC brand’s worldwide status.",[]
41,Arsenal lead the way as Women’s Super League attendances up by average 200%,Just Arsenal News,Michelle,2022-12-09,https://www.justarsenal.com/arsenal-lead-the-way-as/325536,"Arsenal lead the way as WSL attendances up by average 200% by MichelleKelly Simmons OBE, FA Director of the women’s professional game, speaking to the BBC prior to this weekend’s final round of WSL fixtures before the winter break, confirmed that average attendances in the Women’s Super League have increased by 200%, also adding that average attendances in the Women’s Championship are up by 85%.Interest in the women’s game has increased significantly since England won a first major women’s tournament when they beat Germany in the Euro 2022 final earlier this summer.The Lionesses’ victory propelled the women’s game in this country to new levels, said Simmons. It was important for us to capture and capitalise on that momentum.She added: It has often been said that a successful women’s England team will help generate interest in the domestic game.This is certainly true, and I have been really overwhelmed by the response we have seen from fans – new and old – in the first half of the season.I am delighted to reveal that since the season commenced, we have seen almost 300,000 spectators attend matches across the Barclays Women’s Super League.This just highlights how much appetite there is for world-class women’s league football.We are currently averaging almost 6,000 fans a week in the Barclays Women’s Super League as we go into the final league fixtures of 2022 – which is up over 200% on this time last year.The Barclays Women’s Championship is also performing brilliantly, with the average attendance up over 85% on this time last year.Arsenal’s game against Tottenham at Emirates Stadium in September set a WSL record attendance of 47,367.  Indeed, if you peruse the tables below you can see that Arsenal Women are leading the way with the top 2 spots in highest attendances this season so far..Onwards and upwards for our Gunners and the rest of the WSL teams.  This is fantastic news for women’s football as a whole.How many more of you are going to games?  Who’s been to Emirates Stadium?  And how many of you have started watching women’s football more on TV?It would be interesting to hear your thoughts..Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here….Your email address will not be published.

42,History of the Arsenal Womens Team 2012-2022 and The growth of the Womens Super League,Just Arsenal News,Admin Pat,2022-12-02,https://www.justarsenal.com/history-of-the-arsenal-womens-team-2012-2022-and-the-growth-of-the-womens-super-league/324894,"The Arsenal women’s history continued: 2012- presentApologies that it has taken me a little longer to write the second part of the ladies history Gooners but hopefully it will be worth the wait..If you missed the first history of Arsenal Women you can read it here…In case you didn’t know this, Arsenal Women play most of their home matches at Meadow Park, home of Vanarama National League side Boreham Wood, in Hertfordshire Borehamwood of course.The stadium has a capacity of 4,500 and in more recent times Arsenal’s home UEFA Women’s Champions League matches are also played here. Also, in more recent times and due to the growing connection with the Arsenal men’s side it is with great pride that the women are now permitted to play competitive matches at the Emirates stadium, when of course the ground is not being used for the men’s matches and if not equal to, they draw nearly as much crowd as the men do.After mainly male dominated roles at the helm of Arsenal women with Vic Akers the protagonist at the wheel for 22 years and then Tony Gervaise at the helm for just one season after taking over from Akers in 2009-2010, the managerial role would soon become all female dominated for the next few years after Gervaise resigned after only eight months in charge, claiming “a lack of clarity about who was in charge.”Gervaise remained at Arsenal though as he swapped roles with reserve coach Laura Harvey in an unusual development, as she became first-team manager and Gervaise became reserve coach.Harvey’s appointment marked the clubs first female coach in any capacity. However, Harvey’s reign would have a year break in play in preparation for a reformatted league in which Arsenal were named as founder members of the FA Women’s Super League, which began in the spring of 2011. And is now formally known as the WSL.Arsenal won the inaugural season, marking their eighth consecutive English title, and secured another domestic double by also winning the FA Cup. After a two-year period without a league triumph though, Harvey would finish her Arsenal tenure having led the team to three consecutive league titles, two Continental Cups and one FA Women’s Cup, not bad for a first time female manager at the helm of what would be a very very big club in years to come, if it wasn’t already..However, as we know once one person leaves another has to come in and in would come another female, in the form of Shelley Kerr as Harvey’s successor in 2013.Kerr was awarded the UEFA Pro Licence in January 2013 and on 1st February she was said to have been “extremely excited” to be announced as Laura Harvey’s successor as manager of Arsenal Ladies.And she didn’t fail to disappoint, as the club under her management won the FA Women’s Cup twice, once in 2013, and the second time in 2014, two weeks after the men’s team won the 2014 FA Cup, completing a rare FA Cup double for the club.They also won the Continental Cup and finished third in the league during the 2013 season. However, after a poor run of form which saw the club gain only one point from the opening four league matches of the 2014 season, exit the Champions League to minnows Birmingham and suffer a shock loss to Reading in the League Cup, Kerr decided to resign as her magic soon rubbed off only one season later.Kerr’s final game in charge of Arsenal was the 2014 FA Women’s Cup final where they beat Everton 2–0 so all was not lost on this front, as she at least signed off with another trophy under her belt.After Kerr’s departure Arsenal were on the lookout for another manager, and with the lack of female managers out there to choose from it would be yet another male figure who would come in and take the reins.And so, in 2014, Pedro Martínez Losa was named as the new manager of Arsenal Women, succeeding Shelley Kerr.Losa came in with a wealth of experience having managed two female teams in Spain from 2008-2012 in the shapes of Pozuelo Alarcon Women and Rayo Vallecano Women. He then left his post at Rayo and moved to the USA where he would be assistant coach to Aaran Lines at Western New York Flash. During his time there he was also handed the role of Advanced Training Instructor at the Flash Youth Academy.While still a part of the Flash set up, Losa also spent the 2013 season as assistant coach to Niagara Purple Eagles women’s soccer coach Peter Veltri.So, it is no wander with his previous experience that Arsenal were quick out the blocks to snap him up and bring him to England.With Arsenal as his next challenge, Pedro also didn’t disappoint, and led the team to the 2015 FA WSL Cup final and the 2016 FA Women’s Cup, lifting both first time around.He also helped lay even more of the foundations for the team’s current success by signing the likes of Dominique Janssen, Sari van Veenendaal, Daniëlle van de Donk, Katie McCabe, Kim Little, Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema. The last four, whom are still at the club and have all made bigger names for themselves by becoming nothing short of legends at Arsenal.In July 2017, the club rebranded as Arsenal Women Football Club, in a move described by Arsenal as a “clear signal of togetherness and unity” to also help retain the progressive ethos of the club, utilised the core Losa helped build.Losa’s time in charge also included bringing through youngsters with the quality of Leah Williamson, Charlie Devlin and Lauren James, and of course we all know Williamson is also another legend at the club.All good things have to come to an end at some point though and Losa left Arsenal in October 2017, following a mixed start to that season.But in would come another male in the form of Australian Joe Montemurro who had left current club at the time Melbourne City to join the Gunners.On 14th March 2018 Montemurro won his first major trophy with Arsenal by beating Manchester City 1–0 to win the FA Women’s League Cup and two months later on 15th May, he led Arsenal to the Women’s FA Cup final in front of a record attendance of 45,423 at Wembley Stadium, but unfortunately, they lost 3–1 to Chelsea.In the 2018–19 season, Arsenal under Montemurro, became the first FA WSL team to win nine games in a row, scoring a whopping 42 goals and conceding just five.But again, the good times had to come to an end and with that so did the winning streak when an injury-stricken squad lost away to Manchester City.Since his appointment though, it was clear to see that the attacking style and fluidity of possession instilled by Montemurro became noticed by all as he had won many accolades.In February 2019 Montemurro became the first coach from the WSL to be nominated for Manager of the Year at the London Football Awards, alongside Maurizio Sarri and Mauricio Pochettino.On 28th April 2019 in front of a record WSL crowd against Brighton & Hove Albion at the Falmer Stadium, goals from Vivianne Miedema, Katie McCabe, Beth Mead and Daniëlle van de Donk, secured the WSL title with games to spare.This would be Arsenal’s first title since 2012. And as if that wasn’t enough, the season was also capped off with Montemurro winning the WSL League Managers Association (LMA) Coach of the Year and deservedly so, as he led the Gunners to their first WSL title in seven years.The accolade nominations for Joe wouldn’t end their though as in July 2019, he was nominated as FIFA World Women’s Coach of the year and nominations for any manager regardless of what team they manage, is a big thing.Arsenal pretty much picked up where they left off in the 2019–20 season as they qualified for the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League and the team was also part of another record-breaking WSL attendance, when 38,200 spectators came to watch the first ever North London Derby at Tottenham’s Stadium in November 2019 in which Arsenal won the match 2–0. NORTH LONDON IS ALWAYS RED!!!Yet another record was broken one month later, when the women beat Bristol 11–1 at Meadow Park, the highest winning margin in the WSL.That would be the end of the records and the accolades though as in March 2021, it was announced that Joe was to leave the club at the end of the season. Although he had the full support of the Arsenal board, Montemurro decided to leave the club in order to take a break and spend more time with his family, however it would be revealed not long after, that he was to go to Italy to become head coach of the Juventus women.Joe left the club in a good place, as he saw them qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Women’s Champions League, with a couple of trophies in the cabinet for his troubles, but he managed to get them back where they longed to be.Three months after Montemurro’ s departure, in the midst of a worldwide pandemic as well, the club appointed current manager Jonas Eidevall, and in June 2021 he was confirmed as head coach for the club. He is yet to win a trophy at the helm however this season especially, it is clear to see the work rate of the team and the improvements he has made with his coaching.Under Eidevall the women have broken some records already. All this season when they smashed the WSL attendance record during the NLD at the Emirates after 47,367 watched Arsenal beat Tottenham yet again, with a 4-0 score line. They also broke the record for accumulating 10 clean sheets in a row and 14 straight wins in a row before losing, unluckily may I add, 3-2 to Manchester United at the Emirates.Arsenal have also spent well in recent transfer windows, bringing in the likes of Stina Blackstenius and Rafaelle Souza to name a few. Even more so under Eidevall’s tenure, Beth Mead has become a world class player, to those who knew her before she was always one, but over the last two seasons she has become a legend to many an Arsenal fan, also lifting the Women’s Euros title after England’s win over Germany in the summer of 2022. And with the club playing as well as they are this season, surely it will only be a matter of time before they lift the WSL trophy again. We hope…Although I have given a history of the managers of the club and the honours they have won, and as we know Arsenal women have had more than their fair share of managers over the years all with mixed results, there was only ever one legend of a manager for the women’s side to date, that of Vic Akers.In 2018 ex Arsenal manager and legend, Monsieur Arsène Wenger said of Vic Akers: “It is absolutely unbelievable what he did. Unfortunately, he did it at a time where women’s football was not popular or rated so much. I am convinced he is a real football connoisseur, who has the instinct of managing, and I think with time he will get the recognition he deserves. The women’s game would be nowhere near where it is today if it was not for him.”And that comes from one legend to another and I couldn’t have put it better myself.Arsenal are statistically the most successful club in English women’s football, holding the records for most titles won in each domestic competition they have played in.The club has won 15 league titles, 14 Women’s FA Cups, five Women’s League Cups, 10 Women’s National League Cups, five Women’s FA Community Shields, and are the only English club to win the UEFA Women’s Champions League to date.They are also the only English club to win the continental treble while going undefeated in all competitions played that same season and in addition to that, in the 2006–07 season, the club became the first in the history of women’s football to achieve the continental European sextuple.So, it is with a big thanks to Vic Akers who became the club’s first, longest-serving, and most successful manager that the women’s team had that the club is where it is.He made the club what it is today and not just that, he put women’s football on the map and although it is a shame it took so long for it to be recognised and although there is a lot more work that needs to be done to get it to the level of the men, me as a football fan in general, and Vic too no doubt, will be and can be proud to see the beautiful game for both the men and the women, be where it is now.Women’s football is more recognised and, in some aspects, more respected than it ever used to be and even though there is a lot more work to be done as I have said, none of this would have happened and neither Arsenal women nor women’s football would have been as successful as it is now if Vic didn’t dedicate everything he had to the cause of building something special.And so, for that, Mr Akers, we will be forever grateful for what you created and what you have left behind, and here is to many more years of success and even more recognition for the women’s game, and for Arsenal women in particular!Heres hoping hey Gooners!Shenel Osman@sh3n3l_",[]

Manchester United were top of the WSL until losing to Chelsea 3-1 two weeks ago, but this still represents Arsenal’s toughest test so far in the domestic campaign. Arsenal went top of the league with a 4-0 win against Leicester before the international break, and are ahead of Chelsea on goal difference, with Chelsea having played a game more. But matches after international breaks have tended to be tricky for Jonas Eidevall’s side, with players coming back from all over the world, as well as different playing styles. After the last international break, Arsenal squeaked out a 1-0 win against Reading, who are second bottom, and Arsenal lost at home to Chelsea in the Women’s FA Cup semi-final last season following an international break. Manchester United finished outside of the Champions League places last season, and then sold Jackie Groenen right before the beginning of the campaign. Yet, they find themselves in a better position than this time last year, having not conceded a goal until the 3-1 loss against Chelsea. With Mary Earps, Ella Toone and Alessia Russo now European champions, along with Nikita Parris, who joined of course from Arsenal, United have plenty of big game experience. United also have a fairly settled side: a back four of Maya Le Tissier, Maria Thorrisdottir, Millie Turner, and Hannah Blundell, who inverts at left back, and a midfield of Hayley Ladd and Katie Zelem, who hold behind Toone. United, who scored twice against Arsenal last season with set pieces that found Alessa Russo’s head, are strong on crosses and set pieces. United have had more possession in all of their matches so far this season, which could be something Arsenal look to expose on Saturday: are United a good defensive side, or were they just a good defensive side against teams worse than them? Arsenal come into the match with still a litany of injuries, especially in midfield and defence. Leah Williamson, Rafaelle Souza, Kim Little, and Lina Hurtig will all miss out, while there are question marks over Lotte Wubben-Moy and Jordan Nobbs, though both should be fit to play. Vivianne Miedema has returned from a break. Key player: Stina Blackstenius scored his first goal for Arsenal against Manchester United, running onto Vivianne Miedema’s stunning through ball. It was the beginning of Miedema and Blackstenius as a partnership, and while Miedema’s starting role is in question, Blackstenius’ won’t be. Stina has scored 4 goals in 402 minutes, averaging nearly a goal a game, with strong underlying data. Blackstenius constantly runs at defences, looking to exploit space in behind. In that way, Blackstenius will challenge Thorisdóttir and Turner, with neither, especially Thorisdóttir, that comfortable defending space in behind. Predicted lineup (4-2-3-1): 1. Zinsberger; 26. Wienroither, 3. Wubben-Moy, 7. Catley, 15. McCabe; 13. Wälti, 8. Nobbs; 9. Mead, 12. Maanum, 19. Foord; 25. BlacksteniusSubstitutes: 18. Marckese, 40. Williams, 5. Beattie, 11. Miedema, 16.

Let’s watch Highlights of all 100+ Goals scored last season By MichelleOur Gunners had an excellent 2021-22 season under Jonas Eidevall, who was named head coach for Arsenal Women in June 2021, when he replaced Joe Montemurro. The 2021–22 season was Arsenal Women’s Football Club’s 36th season of competitive football, the club having been founded in 1987.Arsenal Women FC have won the most doubles and trebles in English football history. They have also completed a record seven unbeaten league seasons, setting a number of English records for longest top-flight unbeaten run, for goals scored, and points won. Arsenal Women came 2nd in the 2021-22 Women’s Super League, losing out narrowly (by one point!) to eventual champions Chelsea.Here we’re taking a look back at all goals scored by Arsenal Women last season:Our Gunners are currently top of the Barclays Women’s Super League, and remain unbeaten in the WSL, with 14 consecutive wins across last season and this, when they beat Leicester 4-0 away in their last WSL game before the international break. Arsenal’s first game back after the international break is at Emirates Stadium when they face Manchester United, who had also won every single game until they were beaten 3-1 by Chelsea in their most recent WSL match.Tickets for our Arsenal’s clash with Man United are still available to purchase, and 30,000+ tickets have already been sold.

I started the season on the bench and within a few weeks I’m back in the starting XI and captaining the team, which is always an honour for me that will never get old. It’s crazy how quick things can change in football and it’s nice to know that Jonas still sees those qualities in me, both as a player on the pitch and my leadership qualities too.Hopefully we will see more injured Arsenal players coming back to match fitness and back into the Arsenal squad soon, meanwhile here is my predicted Arsenal line-up to take on Everton at Meadow Park on Saturday December 3rd at 2pm.  Tickets available here.ZinsbergerWeinrother, Wubben-Moy, CatleyMcCabe, Walti, Nobbs (C)Maanum, Miedema,FoordBlacksteniusWhat are your thoughts on the game / line-up?Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

47,"Team News, Stats & Facts as Arsenal host Man United Women in big WSL clash today",Just Arsenal News,Michelle,2022-11-19,https://www.justarsenal.com/arsenal-host-man-united-women-in-big-wsl-clash-today-players-stats-facts/323799,"Arsenal host Manchester United in big WSL clash today – Players, Stats & Facts By MichelleArsenal will welcome over 35,000 supporters to Emirates Stadium this afternoon. This match, against Manchester United’s Red Devils, is arguably our Gunners biggest challenge in the Women’s Super League so far this season.  If our Gunners come out on top today they will secure 15 consecutive WSL wins (a new WSL record).  A win would also extend their lead at the top of the WSL leader board.  But Manchester United are not going to make that easy for us.We gave an injury update and talked team form and score prediction yesterday.  Today, match day, we talk about Players, Stats and Facts across both teams.What happened last season?Manchester United were the only side to take points away from Arsenal at home last season, with a 1-1 draw at Meadow Park. Man Utd went ahead in the first ten minutes thanks to Alessia Russo.  It was over an hour later when Stina Blackstenius came off the bench and scored her first Women’s Super League goal in dramatic fashion.Arsenal were 2-0 victors in the away leg at Leigh Sports Village in Manchester, with both Vivianne Miedema and Katie McCabe scoring.What Red Devils to look out for!Manchester United have four Euro 2022-winning Lionesses amongst their ranks, including shot-stopper Mary Earps and attacking duo Alessia Russo and Ella Toone.  Our Gunners will also be reunited with former teammate Nikita Parris, who joined Manchester United in the summer.There are six players who have provided at least three assists in the WSL this season, with three of them playing for United: Katie Zelem, Ona Batlle, and Leah Galton.  Galton particularly, has enjoyed a strong start to this campaign with two goals and three assists in six for the Red Devils.Arsenal team newsKim Little, Lina Hurtig, Leah Williamson, Rafaelle Souza, and Teyah Goldie are not available for selection through injury. Williamson stepped up her recovery during the week, by returning to training at Colney.Despite picking up minor injuries at England camp, Jordan Nobbs and Lotte Wubben-Moy are in full training and should be fit for the tie.  I am tipping Jordan Nobbs to come on as Captain again, in light of Kim Little’s absence.  Beth Mead and Manuela Zinsberger are also available for tomorrow’s tie after leaving international camp early for personal reasons, and Vivianne Miedema has also returned to London Colney following a leave of absence.Eidevall on Man United: It’s a very tough opponent. Manchester United have had a great start to the season. Where [they] went a little bit behind last season was basically in autumn.I think they were a really, really strong team in the spring in the league, and they’ve added some players that made their squad a little bit deeper, and they have kept a lot of continuity in the way that they play. Those things are usually equal to having success, so it doesn’t surprise me.Skinner on Arsenal: They’re a very good team and we did put in two very good performances [against them last season]. It’s a different venue, lots and lots of fans, so I expect a different game to the one we played last year but I still want to see that continued growth from our team.I want us to produce that in the moments that really matter. That’s the next step for us, to perform as well as we can on a consistent basis in these types of games. We have to earn everything against Arsenal because they are a very good team.Facts & Stats:Here is my predicted starting eleven: Zinsberger, Weinrother, Catley, Beattie, Walti, Nobbs (C), McCabe, Maanum, Mead, Blackstenius, Foord.  I’m not sure about Beattie starting, that may be Wubben-Moy.  It depends if she’s really fully on form after injury.I’m still predicting an Arsenal win of 3-1.  What about you?Absolutely cannot wait for this ‘clash of the titans’ match today!Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

48,Who Arsenal Women need to watch out for when they face Everton Women this weekend,Just Arsenal News,Michelle,2022-11-29,https://www.justarsenal.com/who-arsenal-women-need-to-watch-out-for-when-they-face-everton-women-this-weekend/324731,"Arsenal Women take on Everton in WSL this weekend by MichelleOur Gunners are set to face Everton on Saturday at Meadow Park. Everton are currently in 8th position in the Women’s Super League to Arsenal currently holding 2nd spot but we better not let that positioning fool us..Everton have been playing some great football and have had a good few wins this season, even giving Manchester City a run for their money though they lost 2 goals to one at Glanford Park.Everton then got back to their winning ways with a 3-0 victory in their Continental League Cup clash against Sheffield United on Saturday evening, with goals from Katja Snoeijs, Jess Park and Hanna Bennison.Players that Arsenal have to watch out for:Jess Park is only 21 years old and on loan to Everton from Manchester City.  Jess made her debut for the Lionesses when England beat Japan 4-0 in the international friendlies that took place in Spain earlier this month, scoring within 79 seconds of being brought on in the closing stages of the match!  Speaking after the match Jess said:  I’ve built to this moment for a long time in my career and with us already winning, I wanted to go out and enjoy it.  [When the goal went in] it was just a bit of a whirlwind. I thought to myself ‘did that just happen?   I’m proud and honoured to have represented my country. To score with my second touch is amazing too!Arsenal also need to watch out for is the Swedish-born Hanna Bennison, who is only 20 years old and joined Everton in August 2021.  In March 2021 Bennison received the prestigious Goal NXGN Award for the best young female footballer in the world.  She has represented her country since the age of 17 and played in Swedish top-flight football since the age of 15.  Described by her club as a creative, dynamic midfield player with an eye for goal.Appointed in April before officially taking the Everton reins this summer, the 2022/23 season is Manager Brian Sorensen’s first in the Women’s Super League.  Managing Everton Women is Sorensen’s first job outside of his native Denmark; he has won two Danish league titles with Fortuna Hjorring.So, what do Jonas Eidevall and our Arsenal Women have to offer in response to this hungry, young Everton team?  With only 70% of Arsenal’s first-team players available for Jonas to draw upon, unless there are any of Arsenal’s injured players that become match-fit by Saturday that is, then Jonas is going to have to plan this one very carefully indeed.After Arsenal lost 2-3 to Manchester United at Emirates Stadium, in their last WSL match, Jonas reflected on whether the number of significant injuries in the Arsenal squad will require a shift, saying:   I think you can’t take things for granted. I think one of my biggest reflections on the Man United game was that. When you change players, you’re not only changing one player; you’re basically putting out a new team. And that means that in everything you do, you have to start from the basics. You can’t take for granted that just because we did something three weeks ago, that will automatically happen again.  So that’s what we need to work on: to not forget the basics. So we’re building block by block. I think I made a mistake before the United game with that, given that time was short. We will put that right.For sure, Brian Sorensen’s side definitely need to be taken seriously but we are The Arsenal and will be ready to get back to that winning feeling once again I’m sure.  Does Jonas have a fully match-fit Leah Williamson up his sleeve?  Might Lina Hurtig be just about ready to put some time in, after injury?  Could he have some of Arsenal’s big guns to draw upon?  Only Jonas knows..However, each and every one of our Gunners is a walking pool of talent.  Played in the right way I predict a scoreline of 3-1 to our Gunners.Your thoughts on tactics and score prediction appreciated..Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

The match kicks off at 16:15 UK and you can watch live on Sky Sports. Our Gunners will be hoping to secure their eighth win of the WSL season today to keep pace with Chelsea and Manchester United at the top of the WSL table.Alongside Chelsea and Manchester United, Arsenal have only lost one game this season. Arsenal in 3rd place in the WSL behind 2nd place Man United (on goal difference) and 1st place Chelsea (who have played an extra game over ourselves and Man United. This is the current top 8 in the WSL leader board:Having won their last 2 games with 1-0 victories over Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday evening, and Everton in the Women’s Super League the previous weekend an in-form Vivianne Miedema (having been the sole goalscorer in both games) joins a squad bouncing back from injuries as our Gunners head to Villa Park.We published a full form guide earlier this week.  Defensively our Gunners are very strong but they do have to become more clinical in front of the goal and increase that shot to goal ratio significantly.If Arsenal can do this it should be a reasonably easy game for them to handle, with my score prediction being Aston Villa 0 – 3 Arsenal.The last time Arsenal met Villa in May 2022 , they put seven past them at Meadow Park. A brace from Vivianne Miedema, alongside goals from Beth Mead, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Stina Blackstenius, and Nikita Paris made it for one to forget for the Villans. Watch the goal-fest here:Arsenal were 4-0 winners last time they visited Villa Park, with Kim Little, Mana Iwabuchi, and Katie McCabe all on the scoresheet.  Watch the highlights here:Eidevall confirmed, in his pre-Villa presser, that there was no new team news.  Leah Williamson and Rafaelle Souza are back in action after 2 months off with injury.  Captain Kim Little and Lina Hurtig and not expected to be ready to join Arsenal for this game.So let’s hope that our Gunners can crank up the goal tally today – maximum goals and maximum points is what we need!COYG!Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here….Your email address will not be published.

I think that will be very nice, both for players and staff, and after that, we need to go again.  And hopefully, who knows, we might get some of the injured players back, Eidevall added. That will help our squad situation for the Everton game.A healed Lina Hurtig, on form and up front for Arsenal, would be a mighty addition to Arsenal’s front line and we would expect Hurtig to play a much bigger role for Arsenal, much more regularly, for the rest of this season.Leah Williamson has been back in training with her Arsenal teammates in recent weeks.  Having made 199 appearances for Arsenal, is Leah ready and fit enough to hit her 200th appearance for the club this weekend?Is this a hint from the Gunners?….199 Arsenal appearances… ⌛️ pic.twitter.com/mITta4UoGk— Arsenal Women (@ArsenalWFC) November 28, 2022We’ll have to wait for some official team news, of course, but Hurtig and Williamson’s presence this weekend against Everton would be a thing to behold as Jonas slowly manages to rebuild his team.Do you think we should be so lucky this weekend?  Watch this space!Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

55,Arsenal Boss Eidevall still encouraged despite 2-3 defeat by Man Utd Women,Just Arsenal News,Michelle,2022-11-20,https://www.justarsenal.com/arsenal-women-boss-eidevall-still-encouraged-despite-2-3-defeat-by-man-utd/323917,"Arsenal Women Boss Eidevall after 2-3 defeat by Man Utd ‘We are the Arsenal and we never give up’ By MichelleFollowing Arsenal’s first defeat of the Women’s Super League season at the hands of Manchester United last night, boss Jonas Eidevall still found plenty to praise in our Gunners performance, as he talked to the press after the defeat.I was proud of the way that we turned the game around, Eidevall said after the match. I told them at half-time that I didn’t recognise us as a team out there in the first half, either in defence or in offence.  I think we managed to turn the game around and we scored the two goals as a result of that.Everything changes when you concede those two goals from the set pieces. But it doesn’t take away from the players that they managed to turn it around.  We have to look at how we can improve the defending on the set pieces, of course.  But the effort the players had on the pitch, the bravery that they had to change some things for the second half, that was brilliant. That gives me a lot of confidence that we are on the right track despite the result today.Eidevall noted that the game had highlighted specific areas of improvementIn defence, we were not compact enough. We had too much space between our different units.  So it looked like we were constantly one second too late.  And what you would typically relate this to is effort, because you think “can’t that player be closer?”. It’s actually our starting positions and us needing to be more compact.It’s a similar problem in our offence – we became too disconnected. We thought one step ahead too soon and we started positioning too high up on the pitch. And that meant that we had to play the ball in to overcrowded spaces, and it was too compact around where we play the ball.So by changing our positioning to be closer around the ball, we actually open up spaces, and it’s easier for us now to change the point of attack and build up or to get in either in front or behind their defending lines.  So it’s very basic things that we changed at half time. But a lot of times that is the case in football.Despite our eventual defeat, the incredible home support at Emirates Stadium had a noticeable impact on our team’s momentum shift in the second half.The [supporters] are so important for us.  To create that atmosphere, they helped us so much to turn around this game in the second half.  And we just want to repay them and we want to build experiences here with them.  I hope that despite the result that they can feel like we’re putting everything here out on the pitch.So please come back. Please come back next time again, and we go again together.  And that’s what defines us both as a team, but also as a club.  It’s our willingness to go forward. We are The Arsenal and we never give up.Our Gunners will be back in WSL action back at Meadow Park to take on Everton on 3rd December.  Tickets for that fixture are available here.In the meantime, Arsenal’s last game in November is in a few days (Nov 24th) when they head to Italy to face Juventus in their UEFA Champions League campaign.Our Gunners remain top of the WSL league, alongside Manchester United and Chelsea.  We’ll have to see how the Chelsea v Tottenham game goes at a sold-out Stamford Bridge today, to see how the WSL leader board may change, not forgetting that Chelsea have played a game more than Arsenal and Man Utd.Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

Here’s what he said on Aston Villa in his Arsenal pre-match press conference:Eidevall confirmed that there was no new team news after the recent return of Leah Williamson and Rafaelle Souza and no likely return of Kim Little and Lina Hurtig for the Villa game.Eidevall noted his frustration at Arsenal’s performance in the last two games, where our Gunners won both games but only with the narrowest of margins at 1-0 against both Everton and Juventus, saying  I think going forward we need to do that better. Now we sit here with two 1-0 victories, and we’re all happy about that, but in both of these games, in the final minutes, both [opposition] teams have had free-kicks on the side that they haven’t been successful with. But we all know that the more times you let that happen, they will also be successful with that.Rachel Daly is recognised as one of Villa’s star players and currently joint top goalscorer in the WSL this season.  Eidevall talks about Rachel and the Villa threat saying She’s been tremendous. Coming back, it felt like she was scoring everything for a time. Villa are a good team – they have a lot of different threats. Rachel Daly has been phenomenal so far this season, but it’s not only her. Unfortunately it’s not that easy to only [focus] on her. We need to focus on Villa as a whole team in order to deal with them and get the result we want.Indeed, Eidevall has a very healthy respect for Villa, Manager Carla Ward and the squad saying  I think they were progressing [during] the whole spring. We played very well in that game when we won at home at Boreham Wood in the spring but, before that game, they were a really strong team and were really close to getting points at Chelsea. It went to the last minutes of that game before it was decided. We have massive respect for Aston Villa. We see them as one of the teams developing most in the league and Carla Ward is doing a tremendous job there. We know that they will be motivated, they will be ready for Sunday and we need to match that.Aston Villa suffered a devastating 5-0 defeat at the hands of Man United in their last WSL outing and they will certainly not be expecting to lose by anything like that goal difference against Arsenal, particularly with our lack of clinical finishing in recent weeks.  Let’s hope we have some Miedema Magic on the pitch tomorrow and that Blackstenius and Foord can actually find the net.COYG!Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here….Your email address will not be published.

I always think it’s very interesting when you’re playing a European team with this little time in between the games because now the tactical component of what the teams learned from the first game will really play a big part – in set pieces and in open play situations. I see this as a really long half-time break. So let’s hope that we have used this to our best advantage.Montemurro on Arsenal: Tomorrow we’ll have to be good at not getting stretched, especially at the back. It will be important to stay united and compact. We’ll need the same concentration shown against Inter, when we lose the ball we must be immediately ready to win it back.We will focus on what we consider important and try to play our game. We’re up against a strong team in a great stadium, it will be special to play at the Emirates. I want the girls to enjoy themselves out there and take this opportunity as a moment to grow further.Team news update: Leah Williamson and Rafaelle Souza have returned to full training and will be involved in the matchday squad.  Kim Little and Lina Hurtig continue to progress well with their recovery and Eidevall hopes they’ll be back to match fitness before Christmas, but they will not be available as Arsenal take on Juventus tonight.The match kicks off at 8pm (UK time) tonight at Emirates Stadium.  All UWCL fixtures will be free to stream on DAZN’s Youtube channel, wherever you are in the world.  Watch here:Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here….Your email address will not be published.

61,Man United have lacked support and success of other WSL teams. Is that changing?,ESPN,Sophie Lawson,2022-12-06,https://www.espn.com/soccer/manchester-united-manchester_united_women/story/4827181/will-man-united-find-wsl-success-after-off-field-fixes,"Sebastian Salazar breaks down how Spain crashed out of the World Cup and credits Morocco for their performance. (1:03)Currently second in the Women's Super League, Manchester United have only surrendered three points this season and finally look settled under manager, Marc Skinner, who took over last season. But despite their standing, things haven't been handed to them on a platter and have been earned in 90-minute increments.After all, this is a team that for years languished under the poor support of leaders who seemingly forgot Man United had a women's team at all. That is changing, but even so, there are still on-field problems that haven't been eradicated from last season and beyond. And yet, Man United keep finding a way to get results nonetheless -- so, just how far can they take it?Given where they are now, what are United's chances of a coveted top-three finish on the table, or even securing a first Super League title?Just three short matches ago, Manchester United were having their weaknesses exposed by reigning WSL champions, Chelsea. Against a team built with world class players, the Red Devils seemingly had neither the experience nor that last few percent that takes a team from very good to world beaters.Yet when the team from the red side of Manchester travelled to London for their next league outing two weeks later, they looked a side renewed and refocused against the Gunners. Indeed, Man United appeared unwilling to let themselves be overrun by the crushing experience of an Arsenal team that won a first domestic title 26 years before United founded the full-time in-house women's team that plays today.- World Cup 2022: News and features | Schedule 
- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga and more (US)United have been far from faultless this season, and the vulnerability of previous campaigns remains. They've shown similar errors to ones made in their three previous seasons in the WSL -- the mistakes that took them from possible title contenders to participation trophy winners, unable to finish higher than fourth.Yet after their loss to Chelsea, when it looked like they were about to spend another season toiling only to finish just shy of the Champions League placings reserved for the top-three finishers on the table, the Red Devils stepped up and put in a commanding first half performance against an Arsenal team not at their best.The criticism of United at the Emirates was their lack of clinical finish that could have easily seen all three points slip from their grasp. Indeed, from a winning position, United then found themselves chasing late in the game, only to score two late goals -- one in stoppage time -- and shock the team who had been leading the league.Again, finding themselves with two weeks between games, United showed their best when they finally returned to action against Aston Villa at Old Trafford on Saturday. The performance an utterly dominant one, it only improved after half-time tweaks that kept Villa further from the ball, allowing United to settle in a relaxed pattern of pulling and pushing the Villainesses across the turf to carve out goal-scoring opportunities.The result was Man United's most comprehensive win yet of this WSL campaign, a 5-0 thrashing over Aston Villa with goals from five different players. Skinner admitted he wasn't expecting so many of his players to have opened their account for the season so early -- although we are reaching the half-way point of the campaign.In fact, ten of the 13 players who've started for Man United in league play this season have found the back of the net at least once with the only exceptions, goalkeeper Mary Earps, defender Maria Thorisdottir and midfielder Lucy Staniforth. Factoring in goals off of the bench, a total of 12 United players of the 19 who've featured in the WSL have scored so far this season, which, even now, is a clear improvement on last season.As Skinner said on Saturday: ""It's about moving the opponent, last season we faced too many blocks and they [United] just sat in front of them and they couldn't find ways of overcoming that block but now we can play direct if we need to, we can get behind you...""The manager also cited the six draws his team were involved in over the previous campaign, conceding that people might have been sat wondering just where the goals were going to come from in this go-round. But this season, he said, it's not just about being able to rely on more players to contribute goals but about the different ways his team can manipulate the teams they face. He pointed to United's third goal against Villa as the quintessential display of what has changed -- ""the movement, the play, the composure, the manipulation of the opponent: that's what we want as a group,"" he said.For United, it's not just on the pitch that things are looking up but off of it too. Following more than a light rumble about conditions not being up to muster during former manager Casey Stoney's time, that factored into the former England captain's decision to leave. The appointment in October of Polly Bancroft as the club's first head of women's football highlights not just the positive steps United are taking to improve things for their women's team, but also shines a light on their previous failings for the club to get to this point without such a role despite it being an FA requirement.With things looking so grim at United that players were even considering going on strike just a year and a half ago, it's again critical to contextualise just how far the team have come in a short space of time under Skinner, with the former Orlando Pride and Birmingham City coach taking the reigns after Stoney's departure, ahead of the 2021-22 season. Further still, it's paramount to remember that this incarnation of United Women has only existed for 4 ½ years.The sentiment after their defeat to Chelsea was that the Red Devils need time -- time to grow to make the mistakes that they'll learn from to keep improving both on and off the pitch. Things don't come to you overnight in football, regardless of gender, but already we can see just how the pieces are falling into place with this team under Skinner. Even though we're just talking about a change of manager, Stoney had been the one to build the squad from scratch ahead of the 2018-19 season, she had worked to grow that team organically and let them learn from their strengths as the only full-time team in the Championship.Coach, manager, analyst and everything in between during that first season, the team were very much Casey Stoney's Manchester United rather than just Manchester United. So, when she departed to start from the ground up with San Diego Wave in the American NWSL, United were losing not just a coach or manager but a key part of their own foundation as a team.Although Skinner has greater resources to call upon and a stronger support staff, he's found himself in a pair of gargantuan boots that Stoney left behind. Yet, as has been seen in the league so far this season, he is indeed filling them out and finding the best way for his Manchester United to be and play.After their narrow win over a defensively stubborn Leicester City team, Skinner said, ""We're not always going to perform brilliantly"" -- the message was intended for the fans who expect a certain degree from a team that bares the United crest. And indeed, it's fair to have lofty standards but no team is impervious to ugly wins, to the wheezing, crawling-over-the-finish-line matches of attrition -- not least for a team who are, on paper, nowhere near as stacked as the three teams who've finished above them in each of the last three seasons.Yet when you bring their last two matches into view, there is great promise in the team but there is no worry of arrogance from the team who currently sit second in the WSL table, three points adrift of leaders Chelsea, albeit with a game in hand. When asked by ESPN about not getting ahead of themselves, Skinner had this to say:""First and foremost, it helps if you've got good people because they're very honest but secondly it's like... you've done nothing, no disrespect but we've done nothing. We have to earn everything: that's my character, I think your character as a coach, you impart that onto your team. One of our values when we look it as a group, a collective, we give more than we take, it's a principal of ours.""A former teacher, there is something reassuringly nurturing about Skinner, who typically fills his post-match comments with praise for his players but as the coach points out, so much of how his squad functions comes from his own character. So, there is not the worry that the players will lose their grounding despite the increased interest since the Euros or their own standing in the table.In his previous employment with the Pride, the players instantly came out to praise their coach with US veteran defender Ali Krieger even going as far as to say, ""Marc is the best coach I've had in my career and I have that feeling that I want to win for not only us and myself and the team, but for him and the coaching staff.""Becky Thompson and Sophie Lawson reveal the forward lines of their WSL all star teams.Skinner remained a Marmite character with fans during his time in Orlando, with the team perpetually struggling to find form and, in his short time in Manchester, the manager is as divisive when it comes to the United fans. Yet he is again clearly well-liked among the players and he understands, as he did in his last spell in the WSL at Birmingham City, how to get the best from the players he has at his disposal. The biggest gripe that, much like England boss, Sarina Wiegman, Skinner has a preferred starting XI and those on the fringes look doomed to warm the bench.We have, however, seen the manager rotate his squad for league cup games: the area United have struggled the most this season, posting two draws that became shootout losses from their two fixtures so far this season. Although it's no surprise that players who've been without substantial minutes would be coming into their cup starts cold and unable to rely on undeveloped partnerships.Yet if United are to push into the top three in England and take their first fledgling steps in the Champions League next season, rotation and thoughtful player management will be key in not falling out of step with their league as well as European commitments. Although that is a conversation for another time.For now, United look to be going from strength to strength, having finally found their footing under Skinner. However, with rotation likely for their league cup clash with Everton tomorrow ahead of a stern test at the Etihad against noisy City neighbours, the coach will have to find the right balance, not least facing a Manchester City team full of confidence on an eight-match winning run.The dream of finishing top of the table looks as achievable as it ever has for Man United -- yet they know they will not be allowed many slip ups, either against Man City or against Chelsea and Arsenal later in the year.","[""It's about moving the opponent, last season we faced too many blocks and they [United] just sat in front of them and they couldn't find ways of overcoming that block but now we can play direct if we need to, we can get behind you..."", ""the movement, the play, the composure, the manipulation of the opponent: that's what we want as a group,"", ""We're not always going to perform brilliantly"", ""First and foremost, it helps if you've got good people because they're very honest but secondly it's like... you've done nothing, no disrespect but we've done nothing. We have to earn everything: that's my character, I think your character as a coach, you impart that onto your team. One of our values when we look it as a group, a collective, we give more than we take, it's a principal of ours."", ""Marc is the best coach I've had in my career and I have that feeling that I want to win for not only us and myself and the team, but for him and the coaching staff.""]"

Villa moved into the lead 1-0 in the 6th minute..Arsenal did fight back valliantly and really started to take ownership of the game – they are really not used to conceding goals, of course.  Having had a few chances a great ball whipped in front of goal by Katie McCabe found a host of Villa players crowding the box.  Disaster for Villa!  Katie’s ball struck Villa’s Corsie creating a beautiful early Xmas present for Arsenal in a beautifully-wrapped own goal.  Phew!  We’re still only 26 minutes into the first half..Our Gunners continued to dominate from then and for the rest of the 1st half, with Villa finding themselves deficit in defence.  On the 29th minute Vivianne scored her 4th goal in as many games, in true Miedema style.  Scoreline going into half-time Villa 1 – 2 Arsenal.Our Gunners head into the break in the lead and looking confident.. roll on round 2!Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here….     Your email address will not be published.

You can see my Half-time Review here as Arsenal rounded off the first half ahead with Aston Villa 1 – 2 Arsenal.In summary, the first half consisted of a brilliant goal from Villa’s Kirsty Hanson in the 6th minutes with our Gunners going on the counter attack and taking a good command of the game.  Arsenal were then gifted an early Christmas present in the shape of an Aston Villa own goal when Katie McCabe’s ball into the box smacked off the legs of Rachel Corsie and ended up in the back of Villa’s net.  3 minutes later Vivianne scored in excellent Miedema style, taking our Gunners ahead by 2 goals to 1 as we went into the break.In the 2nd half Arsenal still looked dominant.  Williamson came on at 59 minutes for Rafaelle, who was in Eidevall’s starting XI for the first time since returning from injury.  3 minutes later Katie McCabe stuck a belter of a strike that went straight past Hannah Hampton and claimed Arsenal’s goal number 3.  Weinrother & Nobbs came on shortly after, substituting for Miedema & Martitz and Nobbs put Arsenal’s 4th goal into the back of the net 12 minutes after coming on!  A few minutes before full-time Mana Iwabuchi came off the bench as Foord came off – a rare pitch outing for the former Aston Villa player..Tonight marked Arsenal’s 200th appearance in the Barclays Women’s Super League and their performance was worthy of the occasion, with a BIG win in their last WSL game before the winter break.Aston Villa were loose in defence but looked a bit tidy when they did manage to get the ball and drive forward, narrowly missing a few opportunities in both the first and second half.The Arse certainly looked like they were enjoying getting back into their stride tonight.Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here….  A solid performance from the Ladies after going a goal down…👍🏾Your email address will not be published.

And Lina Hurtig, Jordan Nobbs and Lotte Wubben-Moy had to pull out of the international friendlies due to injuries.Good news is that Leah Williamson is back in training with the team though we don’t expect her to be anywhere near match ready yet, as is the case with Rafaelle and Teyah though they all continue to recover well.  Lotte and Jordan are back in full training and should be match fit for tomorrow.  We haven’t received an update on Kim Little’s recovery.1st place Arsenal take on 3rd place Manchester United at Emirates Stadium tomorrow, with over 35,000 tickets already sold.  Arsenal are in great form, returning after the international break.  Kick-off is 5.30pm and tickets are still available to purchase hereWhat do you think of Arsenal’s chances?  With this season’s Women’s Super League trophy firmly in their sights this year there isn’t going to be very much that will stop our Gunners.  That said, Manchester United were defeated for the first time this season, by Chelsea’s 3 goals to their solitary one on Manchester’s home turf.  Having been sat at the top of the WSL until that defeat,  Manchester are currently licking their wounds down in 3rd place.  United will certainly be looking to redeem themselves after that loss but I doubt our Gunners will give them that chance..I definitely fancy Arsenal’s chances in this clash.  Arsenal have won a record-breaking 14 consecutive WSL games across last season and this.  Our Gunners will certainly be vying for another new record of 15 consecutive wins and won’t be about to let Manchester United take that away from them.I predict a final score of 3-1.  I know I’m being very kind giving Man Utd the predicition of a goal but I think there’s only an outside chance of that to be honest, with Manu Zinsberger between the posts.What is your score prediction?  Who’s going to the match?Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

I got through a lot of injuries with mental toughness. Something like that won’t break me, but it was obviously bad timing.I was excited to be part of the squad. Sarina [Wiegman] was amazing with the situation and wants the best for the players. It was the right thing to do, but it was hard to leave camp.I have obviously gone through good and bad days, she says. I know everyone says they learn about their body, but probably last week at England camp I’d have powered through and not said anything.But actually it’s what is best for my body. It’s been tough. You look at the start of the season, I did my ankle ligaments from a tackle I couldn’t prevent. But I think it is just about staying in it.My dad has been there for me. He has been through it as he used to play football.My love for football and getting back on the pitch is so mentally driven. That’s my aim every time something happens. Playing for Arsenal or trying to get back in the England squad is just my aim every time.You can’t always expect football to be an easy ride and I think my main thing is probably learning from past experiences.Jordan has been playing exceptionally for Arsenal in recent weeks, after some weeks on the bench at the start of the season.  She was rightly rewarded with Player of the Match in Arsenal’s 3-1 defeat of West Ham in the WSL, as well as in Arsenal’s 3-1 defeat of Zurich in the Champions League.It certainly sounds like our Jordan has taken the necessary time to recover and is raring to get back on the pitch for Arsenal’s clash with Manchester United on Saturday!  Welcome back Jordan!Hopefully Nobbs will be Player of the Match again in another 3-1 win!See our Form Guide for Arsenal v Man Utd Women on Saturday.Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

How much of a boost does their return have on the squad?When I see us practice and these two players come into our environment, I think it helps us a lot because we get two more players of very high quality into our environment, into our way of playing and of course that will boost any team and it certainly does for us.Have the pair’s leadership qualities changed the squad dynamic?I think when you see a player like Leah coming into the environment, you can definitely see what qualities she will bring both on and off the ball and with her leadership. Absolutely. It’s the same with Rafa – it’s two quality players.Rafaelle Souza suffered from an injury to a metatarsal bone in her foot in early October, when Arsenal beat Ajax 1-2 securing their place in the UEFA Champions League group stage.Rafaelle, captain of the Brazilian Women’s squad also had to withdraw from international duties.  Leah went down with a similar injury shortly after Rafaelle, also being forced to withdraw from the England Women’s squad, of which she is captain.Both players have been sorely missed over the last two months.  Jonas’ announcement on their return to the matchday squad is music to our ears!When asked about Lina Hurtig’s return, Jonas said She’s progressing well just like Kim Little is, but they’re not ready to be in a matchday squad. She’ll hopefully return before Christmas which is great news for the attacking frontline choices..Interview & photo courtesy of Arsenal.It definitely sounds like there’s light at the end of the tunnel on Arsenal’s injury woes..We can’t wait for tomorrow’s match against Everton.  It will be great to see these two super heroes back on the pitch, even if Jonas only re-introduces them on a piecemeal basis.How exciting is this news?Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

It was nice to see us put a few more of them away than we’ve done in recent games. So all in all, good.We knew this was going to be a difficult game and a lot of teams have a problem coming here to Villa Park, playing against a strong Aston Villa this year. So happy with the performance and it’s great to have three points.Speaking about Arsenal’s resilience to come back from one goal behind:I think so. Because one thing that is difficult at that moment is to not let the emotions take over. You want to correct things immediately and that can mean that you start stressing things, and you lose your formation, you lose your balance, and then maybe you get a counter-attack against you, and then there are two goals. Then all of a sudden, you have created a mountain to climb. But we took it step-by-step, so that was very good to see.on our improved efficiency in front of goal…And on our improved efficiency in front of goal after winning our last 2 games by a narrow margin of 1-0 he said:It’s good to see that we were a little bit more efficient in front of the goal. I know we have that quality, but it’s nice for the players to do that as well. And so that was good. And now we just need to recover, refresh and prepare for Lyon. That’s going to be a very exciting – but also difficult – match for us.Our Gunners don’t have a lot of time to rest as they prepare to welcome reigning champions Lyon to Emirates Stadium on Thursday 15th December, 8PM UK kick-off.  Tickets available here.  When asked if he was excited about Arsenal’s upcoming Champions League match Eidevall said:Very. I mean, huge game against Lyon. It’s the European champions to come here to London at Emirates. Be there, be there to support us. We need that. We need to create a great atmosphere at the Emirates. We need to fight for every second of it and if we do and if we do our very best, maybe we can achieve qualification.Interview courtesy of Arsenal.After Lyon on Thursday, Arsenal then head to Zurich on 21st December for their final match of the Champions League group stages before going into the winter break.So our Gunners have moved up to 2nd in the WSL table and are currently top of Group C in their Champions League campaign.  Hopefully they can round off these last 2 group games, knowing they’ve qualified for the UEFA Women’s Champions League.  That would be a great Xmas present for everyone!Michelle MaxwellFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here…. Your email address will not be published.

69,WSL: Liverpool finally win after weeks of building as West Ham's weaknesses are exposed,ESPN,Sophie Lawson,2022-12-04,https://www.espn.com/soccer/english-womens-super-league/story/4825386/wsl-liverpool-deserved-win-exposes-west-ham-weaknesses,"Gab Marcotti and Craig Burley praise Olivier Giroud after he became France's all-time top men's scorer. (2:17)BIRKENHEAD, England -- Liverpool move up to ninth in the Women's Super League with their first win of the season since opening day, a 2-0 win over West Ham on a wintery Sunday afternoon on The Wirral.A miscommunication between West Ham midfielders Kate Longhurst and Honoka Hayashi gifted Liverpool's Ceri Holland an early goal when she picked up the ball after the pair had gotten in each other's way in the box. Under little pressure, Holland let a shot fly into the far side of goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold's goal in the third minute.Struggling without the ball, the Hammers continued to tangle themselves into knots at the back and were soon chasing a two-goal deficit after Liverpool's Katie Stengel claimed her ninth goal of the season with a low strike in the 20 minute.Despite second half adjustments that both strengthened their defence and helped their attack get into the game, West Ham failed to get the better of Liverpool goalkeeper Rachael Laws with the ball travelling from one end of the pitch to the other without another goal scored.The second half marked with multiple stoppages for injuries resulting from chippy fouls, taking all the flow out of the match for both.JUMP TO: Player ratings | Best/worst performers | Highlights & key moments | Post-game quotes |  Upcoming fixturesSince shocking Chelsea on the first day of the season, Liverpool have repeatedly found themselves coming away from matches without anything to show for their 90 minutes of work.Yet, much like the truncated 2019-20 season that saw them relegated on points per game, the Reds have rarely been completely played off the pitch but rather have failed to convert, leaving them chasing games.But with two 3-3 draws in their last two league outings against fellow WSL stragglers Reading and Brighton, there was the growing sense that Liverpool were building towards that all important second win. Indeed, in their penultimate league outing of the calendar year, the Reds finally added their second three-point haul.It was by no means a fluke for the hosts either, but rather a collective effort to keep the ball from Laws' goal whilst getting forward to punish the less-than settled Irons' defence.Without the injured Lucy Parker and opting to start without Hawa Cissoko following her five-match ban, the West Ham defence continued to look weakened for their absences. And for all Liverpool were doing right in attack, there were clear question marks over the strength and understanding of the Irons' backline.The wider problem for West Ham wasn't just the utilisation of Kate Longhurst at centre-back, where she looked out of her depth over the first half, but the apparent lack of communication across the defence. Having lost former captain and centre-back stalwart Gilly Flaherty to Liverpool over the summer, it was clear that the team were lacking not just her experience but her vocality in the box to marshal the backline and repel attacks through understanding and teamwork.Indeed, when Cissoko was subbed on at the break, the defence looked far more comfortable in dealing with what Liverpool had to throw at them, which seemed to galvanise the entire team and allow them to get forward with more ease in the second half.With no specified timeline for Parker's return and the winter transfer window on the horizon, an experienced centre-back would be a sensible investment rather than manager Paul Konchesky trying to convert another midfielder.The defensive problems for West Ham spoke to the wider issue for the Irons -- the team is looking increasingly like a group of players thrown onto the pitch after names drawn from a hat rather than a team put together with partnerships allowed to bloom. Starting the weekend in fifth place in the league, having won four of their eight games this season, instead of growing as the campaign has gone on, the team have looked less and less assured as the weeks go by.Usually, a key player in terms of dictating attacks and popping up with a crucial goal or two, captain Dagný Brynjarsdóttir was kept quiet at Prenton Park and not allowed to orchestrate, highlighting how often the team relies on her inspiration.- World Cup 2022: News and features | Schedule 
- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga and more (US)Unless things change over the winter with the team managing to find more harmony on the pitch rather than relying on moments of individual quality, it's easy to imagine this West Ham team getting sucked down to the wrong end of the table.For Liverpool, who've stayed the course despite not getting the results, this win should be easy to build on with a clash against Leicester City, still pointless after nine games, and give the Reds a further boost ahead of the new year. However, if Liverpool fall back into the patterns they've displayed this season, they may continue to stay closer to the bottom of the pack than they'd like rather than breaking into the meaty middle of the table.The good news for both teams that the shortcomings of those around them are far greater than their own and they will both have more six-point games to play in 2023, allowing this to be more a season of growth and development to set them up for the following seasons, if they have the foresight and patience, that is.Liverpool: Laws 6, Koivisto 7, Hinds 6, Flaherty 6, Matthews 6, Campbell 7, Fahey 7, Stengel 7, van de Sanden 6, Holland 7, Lawley 6Subs: Kearns 6, Daniëls 6, Roberts 5West Ham: Arnold 5, Shimizu 5, Fisk 4, Stringer 5, Brynjarsdóttir 5, Evans 5, Asseyi 5, Atkinson 4, Hayashi 5, Longhurst 4, Smith 5Subs: Cissoko 6, Kyvåg 6The 24-year-old midfielder scored the opening goal and remained involved throughout. Not usually a centre-back -- she's typically a midfielder or wing-back -- she was a fish out of water in the heart of the West Ham defence.It didn't take long for Liverpool to get on the front foot: in just the third minute, Ceri Holland pounced on an unforgivable unforced error to put the Reds ahead over West Ham.As it turned out, that early goal was an omen for how West Ham's defence would look and how the match would ultimately finish.All we need is, Ceri Holland 🎶The goal that has us in front in #LIVWHU 🙌⚽Liverpool manager Matt Beard on whether it was a relief finally getting that second win of the season: ""A little bit, three points was important after the results yesterday but we've been performing okay, it's the inconsistency that was our most consistent performance from start to finish, it reminded me a little bit of the first game against Chelsea but just on the flip: we started fast, done really well got in front, saw the first half out, had to make two or three tactical changes to adapt to what they done but I just felt we dealt with everything really well today and it's a big three points and another step in the right direction""Beard on not conceding: ""I think the clean sheet was important and I think psychologically that will be good for us and especially how direct they were in the last 15-20 minutes to deal with everything that was thrown at us, I was really, really pleased.""Liverpool: The Reds get one week off before they again player host on Sunday, this time to Leicester on Dec. 11, at 9 a.m. ET.West Ham United: The Hammers continued their away stretch and they visit Tottenham on Sunday, Dec. 11 at 9 a.m. ET.","[""A little bit, three points was important after the results yesterday but we've been performing okay, it's the inconsistency that was our most consistent performance from start to finish, it reminded me a little bit of the first game against Chelsea but just on the flip: we started fast, done really well got in front, saw the first half out, had to make two or three tactical changes to adapt to what they done but I just felt we dealt with everything really well today and it's a big three points and another step in the right direction"", 'I think the clean sheet was important and I think psychologically that will be good for us and especially how direct they were in the last 15-20 minutes to deal with everything that was thrown at us, I was really, really pleased.']"

See our ethics statement.The Men’s side won’t play a match until December 22, but the Manchester City Women are back in WSL action tomorrow away to Everton. Sky Blue News is here with all the latest to get you ready.Haaland has had a sensational start to life at City, scoring 23 goals in 18 matches which includes 18 in 13 Premier League outings. The attacker will be resting during the World Cup after Norway’s failure to qualify for the finals so will be ready to increase his tally and possibly go for the league record when the season resumes in December.Agent Pimenta said Haaland “deserves” the hype he is getting although remained tight-lipped on any release clause suggestions. “You have to do it [ask the question about the release clause] and it is very interesting,” she told a reporter, as per Marca.“If we don’t say anything, surely something is interpreted and if we say something, too. As a lawyer I know that I can’t say anything, but I also know that if I don’t say it, they will say it.”Manchester City star Erling Haaland speaks exclusively to GOAL about his incredible start to life in the Premier League.She added: “It’s a very nice thing [the rumours], but I hope there aren’t too many. I understand the attention, the curiosity that arouses. It’s the novelty.“Curiosity is normal, but I hope with Erling, when there are no things to say, they don’t make them up. This is something that is happening. They look for easy clicks.Some of City’s international stars were greeted with the cliched Manchester welcome as they returned to training on Thursday.Despite battling the elements, our players remained in good spirits as we gear up to return to league action on Saturday.We get back to the Barclays Women’s Super League campaign away to Everton on 19 November, with kick-off scheduled for 15:00pm (UK).We will be looking to extend our run of five victories to six at Walton Hall Park, and matching our result from our last meeting with the Toffees would do just that.Gareth Taylor’s side put four past Everton at the Academy Stadium back in March as a Simone Magill own goal was followed by strikes from Ellen White, Alex Greenwood and Laura Coombs.(T)raining! ☔️ pic.twitter.com/nJzQpC3LMOIf we can get Guardiola tied down before the end of the World Cup break it would be a massive boost for the second phase of the season for the entire club. It will also shape how we go for the next 2/3 seasons transfer market wise in my opinion. The club is built for Pep to do his job, and do it successfully, with minimal interference from the board or other board pressure outside of getting results. Which has been something Pep Guardiola has always done pre his arrival at Manchester City for Barcelona and Bayern Munich, and over his trophy laden reign at the Etihad.The question for me if Pep Guardiola does decide to take a break from management and not extend his contract post this season, where does the club turn next as manager? The candidates out there aren’t screaming out to jump into the Manchester City hot seat. There are quality candidates out there but as it stands not anyone jumping to the head of the queue, nor anyone who seems that they could fill his giant shoes at this current time. The time to assess that market isn’t now, that will only come if a decision to call time on his reign at the Etihad comes from Pep Guardiola. So I’ll not go over potential replacements for Guardiola until that time becomes necessary.Dias was injured at the beginning of the campaign, but is now fully fit to take his place at the heart of the defence. Fit enough to start the Carabao Cup games, the centre back should be a regular starter for league matches.A player that won so many awards in a team that is full of outstanding talents is indeed special. He should be the first name on the team sheet as far as the defence is concerned. He cannot rank behind Aymeric Laporte, Manuel Akanji, John Stones and even Nathan Ake in the pecking order.The likes of Akanji and Ake have started the season well with the former surpassing most people’s expectations. Yet, Dias remains number one among the central defenders. Hence, he should lead the way, especially in difficult matches.With City losing ground in the title race, the manager will need to make some changes on resumption of the league next month. One of those will be reinstating Dias as the number one centre back in the team.Why Ruben Dias Will Be Crucial for Manchester City This Season https://t.co/wBQ50yvxJTBarcelona’s Ansu Fati scored the opener for Spain in the first half before strikes from Gavi and Nico Williams followed after the break. Jordan’s goal was a late consolation from Hamza Al Dardour.Laporte started the match in the left side central defender’s role in a back four which included Villarreal’s Pau Torres on the left and Garcia to our man’s right.Carlos Soler, Koke and Gavi made up the midfield three although Luis Enrique is expected to make changes ahead of the start of their World Cup campaign on Wednesday 23 November when they play Costa Rica.Following that, they have assignments against Germany and Japan to navigate if they are to qualify from Group E.The former centre piece for the Commonwealth games in the city has become of the most iconic football venues in the world, largely following the success seen by the Premier League giants since their takeover from the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008.The next step for Manchester City and the Etihad Stadium could be their hopes of being included in the final list of the stadia submitted by the UK and Ireland next year.That offer to host the European Championships of 2028 has this week been confirmed.As confirmed in a report by the Athletic this week, the UK and Ireland have now submitted their joint bid to host the 2028 European Championships.As part of the confirmed bid, nine stadiums from England, two in the Republic of Ireland, and one in each of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have been named in a provisional list.Subsequently, four stadiums will be removed when the final list of grounds is submitted to UEFA in April, 2023.  | Manchester City's Etihad Stadium among 14 stadiums included in the UK and Ireland's Euro 2028 bid https://t.co/Pp3ELZWuujAnd finally... Thanks for the assist Fergie.This isn’t particularly new information. City wanted to sign Ronaldo after missing out on Harry Kane, and they faced the prospect of going into the 2021/22 season without a recognised striker. Ronaldo was available, and while it would have been sensational given his United connections, there were merits to the interest - although City say they weren’t as close to a transfer as Ronaldo claims they were, and Guardiola said at the time he didn’t feel they would have signed him had he not ended up across town.City, and Guardiola, don’t sign any striker for the sake of it, and Ronaldo’s 24 goals in a struggling United side showed he would still have been able to score goals. Just look at Erling Haaland this season, who is dispelling the idea that City strikers need to press high and also come back to get involved in the build-up. It helps, but as long as you’re scoring goals, it’s not essential.But Ferguson and his band of United legends couldn’t bear to see Ronaldo in sky blue, so they stepped in and instructed United to re-sign their hero instead. It could be the biggest gift Ferguson has ever given to City.Sir Alex Ferguson's Cristiano Ronaldo chat has ensured his Man City nightmare is set to continue #mcfc https://t.co/vQdlIYAjgUThere you are.

72,"Newcastle women are no vanity project with a 25,000 crowd set to see Becky Langley's side in action",Daily Mail,Kathryn Batte,2022-11-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-11471881/Newcastle-women-no-vanity-project-25-000-crowd-set-Becky-Langleys-action.html,"By Kathryn Batte For Mailonline  Published:  11:39, 26 November 2022   |  Updated:  11:45, 26 November 2022    17View  commentsIt has been just over a year since Newcastle United became the richest club in the world. On day one, there was talk of the trophies, the Champions League and big-money transfers. But also on the agenda, was a commitment to supporting the women’s team. Chief executive Amanda Staveley outlined how the new owners were ‘wholeheartedly committed to women’s and girls football.’ Amid the controversy of the Saudi-backed takeover, it was perhaps an easy win. A PR stunt, some may say. But as Sportsmail speaks to women’s head coach Becky Langley at the club’s Academy training centre, it is clear this is no vanity project.Newcastle United's Saudi-backed takeover has led to new investment in the side's women's team, with Amanda Staveley particularly interested in their success‘When the owners first came in, everyone was really excited but also a bit nervous of what that meant for everybody here,’ Langley says. ‘With being the richest club in the world, there was that element of doubt of are they just going to bring in a whole new staff team, a whole new player team? They can probably afford to buy Lucy Bronze!’Staveley has taken an active role in supporting the women’s team. Last season she turned up unannounced at a game at Northumbria University’s Coach Lane Campus and was spotted peering through a fence trying to watch the action unfold. She has also attended every home game at Kingston Park this season.‘Amanda talks to myself and the players about how, when she was a young girl, she’d have loved to have played football but there wasn’t that opportunity for her,’ Langley says. ‘She’s really passionate about making sure that every girl in the area has the opportunity to play football and doesn’t have to pay to do so. There is a real genuine care about the women’s team, it isn’t a PR stunt, there’s no two ways about it. They show that in that they want to come and watch our fixtures.Staveley has taken an active role at the club and attended every one of their home games this season‘They really want us to do well and I think Amanda is excited that we could be the first Newcastle team to win silverware if we go on to win this league, unless Eddie and the boys have a good experience in the Cup!’It is not just Langley who is feeling the support of the ownership. Forward Katie Barker, age, is a life-long Newcastle fan. She was forced to play for Sunderland in her youth and went on to make her WSL debut for the Blackcats, but now there is a chance to progress at the club she loves.‘To finally be part of Newcastle United is amazing. It makes us feel cared for, recognised,’ Barker tells Sportsmail. ‘One day there will be a kid like me, a die-hard Newcastle fan growing up, and they won’t have to go and play for Sunderland. It’s amazing to know we’re impacting the young girls that come to watch us play.’Previously players had to get a sponsor or pay a fee of £400 a year to fund kit, buses and equipment. While some players had the support of businesses and family, others had to pay by direct debit. The club's women's team drew a crowd of over 20,000 fans to St James' Park when they played Alnwick Town Ladies in MayMoney provided by the new ownership has relieved that burden and the team now train once a week at the men’s site in addition to their other two sessions a week. But there is an understanding that they must build in a sustainable way.‘What people need to remember is that the players are still part-time players,’ Langley says.‘Yes, they’ve got additional support services and they’ve got a little bit of financial support from the club, but we’ve still got players who are full-time students, we’ve still got players who are full-time police officers, players that are assistant head-teachers, we’ve got players that are still working a 50-60 hour week. The reality is they’re not full-time footballers which wouldn’t be right at this level currently.‘We’ve got the ambition and a long-term plan but our feet are on the ground in that we’re playing tier four football. Some of the teams we will play in our league will have really limited resources.’Becky Langley's side normally play their home fixtures at Kingston Park, home of the Newcastle FalconsAs it stands, Newcastle require three promotions to reach the Women’s Super League. They are second in the National League Division One North, one point behind Durham Cestria. But the club would be in a strong position to apply for a top flight licence should the FA decide to expand the league.‘I’m sure if that opportunity arises we’ll be pushing to see if we can in any way leapfrog the leagues,’ Langley says. ‘Of course we want to play at the highest level we can. But I think there’s also something quite special about starting in tier four and actually seeing it as a project to build.’Langley’s side will play their second game at St James’ Park on Sunday, with over 25,000 tickets already sold. Their first fixtures at the men’s stadium on May 1 attracted a crowd of 22,134 but following England’s success at the Euros, there is hope that they can surpass the 47,367 attendance of north London derby.‘I think we’re all ambitious and really excited that if we push the game and advertise it in the right way and if we’ve got a good momentum of winning football games then people will want to see the product that is on offer,’ Langley says. But over 25,000 tickets have been sold at St James' for their clash with Bradford City W.F.C‘We’d obviously love to beat that record and we’re all very aware of the great crowd that Arsenal and Tottenham got and we just want to surpass that hopefully.’There is an accusation, on the men’s side, that Newcastle fans feel ‘entitled’ to success. That is not true. They just want to be able to dream, to have hope. Now, after years in the wilderness, the women’s team can dream too.‘We’re hungry for success,’ says Langley. ‘Without the support of our owners, we wouldn’t have the ambition to be in the WSL. It’s not just about the financial support, it’s about feeling cared for.’

74,"Man United end Arsenal's unbeaten run in five-goal thriller as Toone, Russo shine",ESPN,Sophie Lawson,2022-11-19,https://www.espn.com/soccer/english-womens-super-league/story/4806650/man-united-end-arsenal-unbeaten-run-as-russo-scores-late-winner,"Becky Thompson and Sophie Lawson reveal the forward lines of their WSL all star teams. (1:30)LONDON -- WSL league leaders Arsenal saw their 14-match winning streak come to an end at home to Manchester United after a pair of late strikes from the visitors. In flying form coming into the match, Arsenal failed to find their better football and went in at the break a goal down thanks to Ella Toone's late first half effort.- Report: Arsenal 2-3 Manchester United | WSL table | Upcoming fixturesNot on the back foot for long, the hosts equalised early in the second half thanks to Frida Maanum's deflected drive before Laura Wienroither gave them the lead. Lively throughout the match, Untied refused to be beaten and found their own equaliser through Millie Turner at a late free-kick before Alessia Russo completed the breathless turnaround with her own header at set piece in the dying seconds of regular time.JUMP TO: Player ratings | Best/worst performers | Highlights and notable moments | Post-match quotes | Key stats | Upcoming fixtures1. United expose Arsenal's weaknessesStill playing with an improvised backline following injuries to starting centre-back pair, Leah Williamson and Rafaelle, the Gunners had done well to weather most incoming attacking storms before this outing. Yet, once Leah Galton who has been digging down into some of her better form this season began to run at the usually unchallenged defensive line, the entire Arsenal team began to quake.- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)Indeed, it was the visitors who enjoyed the better attacking spells during the first half as they stretched the play across the broad Emirates pitch that Jonas Eidevall's team usually relish playing on and had yet to be beaten on in the WSL, winning all four of their previous league matches played in N7.Even when Arsenal found their equaliser at the start of the second half to swing the match into their favour and help them build momentum, the fragility of their defence remained clear when United questioned its resolution. And with Manuela Zinsberger having a less than faultless day in goal, United trusted in themselves to keep going and indeed, find the moments of quality to see them come away with all three points.2. Arsenal's stuttering styleComing into the tie on a 14-match winning run in the league -- a running WSL record -- the Gunners have looked like a team on a mission, with a razor-focus on all the silverware ahead of them. With the 2021-22 season bringing about a dearth of silverware -- a rarity for one of the most successful clubs in the country -- the runners up from last year have been attacking all matches with a belligerent ferocity, pressing their opposition hard and high, scoring for fun along the way.Yet against Manchester United, that fluency between players was lacking, rapidly dissolving like a puddle on a hot day, leaving only the stain of a memory in its place. It was true that the 11 who started against United weren't necessarily the 11 who Eidevall would have picked out of choice, but rather were the best available to him based on form and fitness. So, it could be argued that the lack of week in week out familiarity in games was lacking yet, the team was the same that had started their last league game before the international break.Arsenal, as a team however, understand the way their manager wants them to play, nuances and tweaks for individual games aside, there is a clear and punishing style that the Swede preaches. However, without a player like Kim Little on the pitch to be able to get in and weight the midfield battle in the favour of the Gunners, the system begins to degrade and fail across the pitch. The absence of the Scot in such close games asks everyone on the pitch to find a better first touch, and get comfortable moving the ball at pace without losing the accuracy that is vital. Even with Maanum's goal acting as an accelerant to light the fire under the hosts and force a higher tempo, it was the accuracy and comfort with the ball that was still wanting from Arsenal.3. United find a 90-minute performanceIn their last match before the international break, United battled hard but ultimately came up short against current champions, Chelsea. It was a match riddled with mistakes from both but the difference on the night was Chelsea's ability to go to their bench and find the players to make the difference, to encourage those on the pitch to punish the mistakes when they happened, something the Red Devils could not do.In London, United fired out of the blocks and instead of playing a balanced match as they did against Chelsea, took the fight to the hosts. It was a bold strategy but one that paid dividends as they found the weaknesses in the Arsenal midfield and defence to exploit.At 0-1 and 2-1, the complaint from United was easily that they didn't make the most of their first half chances. It looked as if they were going to leave with nothing after deserving something but it was being able to dig deep, to hold themselves firm in the face of Arsenal's attack and cut forward with enough power to keep creating that was the difference for them today.Again for Man United, it was Katie Zelem's critical dead-ball delivery that propelled them to victory with both second half goals coming from her crosses into the box, but they wouldn't have been a positivity if not for her teammates driving forward and working the defence and goalkeeper. Against Chelsea, it looked as if the gap was indeed closing but only minutely, and that United were still a long way from being able to mix it with the top two in England but at the Emirates, the Red Devils reached out and grabbed their opposition, dragging themselves up to their level, slamming the gap shut. Even if it is only for one match whilst Arsenal don't have all their favoured starters to call upon, it's a reminder that United are there, in touching distance and on a good day, they can compete with anyone.Arsenal: Zinsberger 4, Wubben-Moy 4, Catley 5, Wienroither 6, Nobbs 5, Mead 6, Maanum 7, Walti 5, McCabe 5, Foord 4, Blackstenius 5

The defining moment in this game came not with any of their goals, rather in a small but significant incident a couple of minutes into injury time. Neve Herron went in for a 50:50 with Demi Stokes just to the right of the Sunderland box. Both former Gateshead College players were fully committed, eyes only for the ball, and it was the youngster in red and white who came away with the ball. It felt symbolic, like the passing of a torch between generations.Herron’s full range of talents were on show from the very outset and no doubt the eagle eyes of the City Group will have been keenly trained on the versatile youngster. She was nominally playing on the right of three central defenders but was everywhere - popping out of defence to break up play, clearing loose balls in the box, dashing down the wing to create counter attacks, crunching through multiple players in the last few minutes to ensure the scoreline remained respectable.There were fleeting movements and moments in this game where we looked very much their equals. Had Brianna Westrup hit the net with her first half header from a corner, it could have been a very different game.Man City’s quality and depth was pretty awesome to see up close and in person. Bunny Shaw is a wonderful footballer and when our defenders saw her name on the teamsheet, their hearts must have dropped.Physically imposing but with a deftness of touch and an intelligent positional sense, the Jamaican centre forward was quite literally head and shoulders above anyone else on the pitch. When she latched onto Steph Houghton’s beautifully weighted through ball to make it three nil, all I could do was applaud. If you don’t appreciate that kind of quality, football’s not the game for you.Sunderland’s forwards - Gears, Dodds and Manders - never stopped running, and the same goes for their replacements Grace Ede and Abby Holmes, but had a hard time getting any change from Alex Greenwood and Houghton and there were moments when our propensity to be careless in possession meant decent opportunities to break went to waste. As hard working a defensive display as this was from the Lasses, City hardly broke sweat for large portions of the game. The gulf between a side crammed with internationals and a group of women who will be back in work in their other jobs tomorrow morning was always there, only compensated for by the pure graft and organisation that Mel Reay and Steph Libbey have trained into their team.The Manchester City Academy Stadium is a great place to watch football and the physical representation of a club that sees its female stars as an important part of its overall brand. Etihad’s greenwashing adverts scrolled around the perimeter advertising as the DJ tweaked nobs on her digital decks to get the pre-match atmosphere pumping. A HD neon screen showed the clock and a crystal clear PA announced the substitutions. The catering was spot on - Vegan Chickpea Curry Pie and a free cuppa. Everything was slick, professional and very much not a non-league experience. Abu Dhabi’s money has indeed created a world-class setup in all areas of the club.But the lasting impression I’ll take from our visit is of a club whose fanbase consists of a much younger, much more female, much more diverse demographic than I’ve seen elsewhere on my travels in the last few seasons. Being situated in the heart of the East Manchester community, it there seemed to be a genuine connection between the players and the supporters. The 2,500 fans there were pretty noisy, and this was encouraged through the distribution of those god awful clackers. The chanting and singing, some very creative - “She’s big, she’s blue, she’ll eat a Kangaroo, Jill Scott, Jill Scott” - others were inexplicably North American (honestly, I didn’t think that “I believe that we will win” would ever migrate across the Atlantic, but each to their own), was really good to hear. The lack of an away end meant we had to sit amongst it and endure the wondering looks and tutting disapproval of those around us, which sometimes seemed to suggest they couldn’t comprehend why anyone would support a team that wasn’t guaranteed to win 80 per cent of their matches. What was also nice to see was the smattering of red and white throughout the stands - we saw a little girl with a Sunderland flag was there with her parents, I presume a family of exiles taking their kid to support their side. This is great, and one advantage of these Conti Cup ties is that a game against one of the big Manchester or Merseyside clubs is almost guaranteed every year. I hope it was a special and formative game for her despite the scoreline. For someone with a long memory, however, there was more than a tinge of jealously wrapped up in this away day. Until they won the ownership lottery in 2008, becoming the pioneering state-run club in English football, there was little to separate us in men’s or women’s football.Even in 2010, they didn’t apply for the inaugural Women’s Super League - neither did we. But Man City have been an ever present in the WSL since 2012, when they joined the top flight despite Sunderland topping Tier 2. It was the money from the UAE that was decisive then, but you cannot question their commitment ever since. That many of Sunderland’s greatest ever female players made the impressive City campus their long term home is no surprise, and they wouldn’t have been the champions they are without the professional facilities and sustained investment on display at Eastlands. Yet I left the ground wondering if we’re about to see a similar exodus - Grace Ede is already on a dual contract with them, and, after this game, they’d be daft if they weren’t trying to prise Herron from us too.

Sunderland and Leicester are this evening’s main feature in the ever-quirky Conti Cup.There’s almost a whole division between the two sides, but nobody is expecting this to be a walkover for the Foxes. They’re coming off the back of some pretty heavy defeats and their confidence will have taken a battering on Sunday in the 8-0 loss to Chelsea.   These midweek games under the lights are increasingly rare, and despite the bitter cold we can expect a decent crowd down at Eppleton this evening. The Bovril will be flowing and plenty of chips will be served, no doubt. And don’t forget, this one will go straight to penalties if the scores are level at the final whistle, and even the eventual losers will take a point in Group B in that scenario.  As voted for by you...The #BarclaysWC Player of the Week is @SAFCWomen's @emilyscarr11 pic.twitter.com/IaGdDWmYRCBrianna Westrup limped off early on in the Coventry United game on Sunday, and with both Faye Mullen and Abby Towers on the long term injury list and a lack of many other options at the back, we should expect to see a first choice defensive line including Neve Herron in the centre. There’s also the chance of one or two of the defenders from the Under 23s - who remain unbeaten in their Durham County league campaign - being given a spot on the bench, if only to get them familiar with the first team environment. Further up the field, I expect Jess Brown and Tyler Dodds to continue on the wings as maintaining their form will be important. However, we might see Nicki Gears start up front and Libbi McInnes dropped into the midfield as both have had limited game time this season, and perhaps with Grace Ede given a shot in a number 10 role.   Mel may well also give a start to Ali Cowling in the place of Claudia Moan, who is now well established as the first choice goalkeeper in the league side. However, there are only four days between this and our game at Blackburn in the FA Cup on Sunday and with that third round game guaranteeing at least £13,750 in prize money, we can expect priority to be given to the more prestigious competition, so we shouldn’t be surprised to see even more wholesale changes to the lineup when the team is announced at 6.30pm.  Leicester were awarded a place in tier two alongside Manchester United, Spurs and West Ham in the same round of changes that saw Sunderland demoted to tier three in 2018. Since then they’ve gained promotion, reached the Conti Cup Final and looked like they would become the dominant Midlands side in the same way as their men’s team have over the last decade.However, since Aston Villa’s promotion in 2020 their fortunes have turned and they spent last season battling with Birmingham City to avoid relegation from the WSL. That battle is now looking more desperate than ever, they’ve not picked up a single point in nine league games and their only win of the season came against Blackburn in this competition.They sacked their Head Coach Lydia Bedford a month ago and installed then Director of Women’s Football Willie Kirk, the former Everton boss, in the hot seat. Results, however, have not improved - suggesting that the lack of investment in players during the summer is at the root of their woes in the league.Share some hope this ChristmasNevertheless, this game undoubtedly gives them a break from the grind of the WSL and the opportunity to rebuild their confidence. No doubt they will see Sunderland as beatable and approach the game accordingly, but being fit and ready for their game against Liverpool in the league on Sunday will take precedence for their regular starters.This is the first-ever meeting between the two sides in any competition.It’s pretty rare these days for a 16-year-old to make their debut in the Women’s Super League, but England starlet Ava Baker did so in May 2022 following appearances in the Conti Cup and the FA Cup last winter. The midfielder is seen as one of the country’s most exciting prospects and is an international teammate of our very own Grade Ede and Katie Watson. She starred for the Foxes’ highly successful Academy side last year, winning player of the match as the youth team beat Arsenal to claim the League Plate.She started on the left wing on Sunday in the defeat to Chelsea, and is expected to retain her place in the team for tonight’s match, so this could be a unique chance for Sunderland fans to watch a future Lioness in action.

What can Sunderland Women expect when they take on the Citizens in the cup?If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Dave: Most fans went into this season thinking it could be one of transition.  There were a lot of comings and goings last summer and we thought that a number of new players may need time to gel together. However, after an initial defeat at Aston Villa where we looked a bit sluggish, we’ve performed excellently and to be honest, we’re ahead of the curve of where I thought we’d be at this stage of the season.  Dave: Georgia Stanway, Lucy Bronze, Keira Walsh and Caroline Weir had all been fantastic at City, and when club legends Ellen White and Jill Scott both retired, of course that caused concern.Gareth Taylor and his staff have recruited very well, however. They did not look to replace on a like-for-like basis, but players such as Laia Aleixandri, Deyna Castellanos, Leila Ouahabi, and Yui Hasegawa have come in and hit the ground running. I believe that we’ve recruited players to fit the style we want to play, and it’s worked very well over the early part of the season. There’s a mixture of potential and experience, and on the whole, they’ve performed fantastically.Dave: City have built up some momentum since losing the first two games of the WSL season, which came on the back of an early Champions League exit to Real Madrid. The start of the season came after a successful summer with the Euros, and I honestly believe the lack of a pre-season was a factor. We weren’t at our best on the opening day, but the next game away to Chelsea was an excellent performance and if we’re honest, a 0-2 defeat was extremely harsh. Since then, the momentum and confidence has seemingly grown as our ‘new’ team has turned in excellent performances week in and week out. Dave: I think City will field a mixture of players who need vital minutes, along with some of our promising younger players. Experienced players such as Steph Houghton, Demi Stokes and Filippa Angeldahl are all short of match time, along with Ruby Mace who is on the verge of returning from injury, and I expect all of them to start, fitness permitting.Alanna Kennedy has also yet to feature due to injury and her international teammate Hayley Raso was also absent last week at Everton. If fit, they may well feature.  Against Blackburn, we put a number of academy prospects on the bench, so this may well be the way we play on Sunday, as Gareth Taylor rotates his squad to keep everyone fresh and match fit ahead of a busy run of games leading into the Christmas period.Dave: City are equally focused on every game, regardless of the competition.  We’re the proud holders of the Conti Cup and have won the trophy four times since we turned professional in 2014, including an amazing triumph in our debut season.  This trophy has a very special place in the hearts of the club and the supporters. We finished third in the league last season, as well as winning the Conti Cup and finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in an amazing FA Cup final, so we do approach every single challenge with an equal will to win.Dave: To be honest, most of the new players I’ve already mentioned could be considered as having a ‘breakout season’.  Rather than repeat that, I’ll mention a player who was already at the club and who’s almost become the first name on the team sheet for league games.  Esme Morgan has been at City since she was young. She worked her way up through the academy and after a year on loan at Everton, and then a horrific injury which kept her out for a year, she’s been fantastic at the heart of our defence this season. Her outstanding performances have not gone unnoticed, as she’s made her debut for the Lionesses at senior level and has captained the side during our last two games versus Everton and Reading. She deserves all the plaudits that she’s getting. Dave: If fit, I’d expect the likes of Filippa Angeldahl, Julie Blakstad and Hayley Raso to cause you problems on Sunday.  The pace and directness of our wide players is always first class and even if Bunny Shaw doesn't start up top, they’ll create chances for whoever does, as well as themselves. Deyna Castellanos has also looked good, and if she plays, she’s bound to bring an attacking threat.  In all honesty, it’s difficult to know for sure which team will line up on Sunday, but it’s a game we need to win, as our next two group games see us away from home, at Liverpool and Leicester.Dave: I’m traditionally awful at predictions, but as you’ve asked me for one, I’ll go for 3-1 to City. As a general rule, we’re very good at home, and I hope to see us continue our recent good form. Dave: Any fans making the journey on Sunday will be most welcome.  We play our home games at The Academy Stadium, which is just a footbridge crossing over the road from the Etihad Stadium.   There’s free parking at the Etihad’s blue car park on matchdays, which is located at the back of the stadium off Alan Turing Way.  From there, you can head over the Nexen Tyre bridge to our stadium, which is a five to ten-minute walk.If supporters need tickets, there’s a ticket booth at the academy end of the bridge and they’ll happily sort tickets out for you. Our stadium is cash-free inside. Programmes and food are available but must be paid for via card. However, hot and cold drinks are free on all matchdays this season. Our MCWFC OSC table is just inside the north east entrance, in case any visiting fans want to come in and say hello. We also sell an OSC matchday badge for every game, so they may want to pick one up.The atmosphere is generally generated in the middle of the main stand, where we as a group have our season tickets, but it spreads out around all areas and is good-natured, with all visiting supporters seemingly enjoying their visits to our ground.

When Sunderland have both of our men’s and women’s teams in the top tier of English football, you know all is right with the world.In November 2009, the Lads were having a very decent season indeed, and after a 1-0 win over Arsenal at the Stadium of Light, Steve Bruce’s side sat eighth in the Premier League. Darren Bent had grabbed the goal, supported in a hard-working midfield by the likes of Steed Malbranque, Kieran Richardson, and Lorik Cana.We also had a young Jordan Henderson in the men’s side, and there was also another future England international named Jordan - Jordan Nobbs - who was making waves on the Lasses side of the club too.Having gone all the way to the FA Cup Final that spring and given Arsenal - the dominant side of the time who had only lost once in six years - a hell of a fright in a 2-1 defeat, we had been promoted to the Women’s National Premier League 1, the top tier, and Sunderland Women looked set to become a real established force. The season had gotten off to a good start, with our only league defeats coming against Forest, Jill Scott’s Everton, and the Chelsea side we’d vanquished at the Stadium of Light in the Semi Final of the cup. And so the week before, Sunderland Women had travelled south to play the Gunners and come away with a goal - but we conceded five in return. Historically, this would have been seen as a pretty decent result, given the gulf in resources between the two set-ups.But at Eppleton that day, with Arsene Wenger’s side having been sent back down the A1 with their tails between their legs, Mick Mulhern’s women managed what had for many years seemed almost impossible, and grabbed all three points. The Sunderland starting lineup included Nobbs, Demi Stokes, Lucy Staniforth, Kelly McDougall, Rachel Laws, and Abby Holmes. Arsenal’s side read like a roll-call of the greatest names in the history of the game - Katie Chapman, Jayne Ludlow, Rachel Yankie, Gilly Flaherty... it was some team. We managed to get to 0-0 at half-time, but then the legendary Scottish forward Kim Little scored her 23rd goal of the season, latching onto a Julie Fleeting pass to round Laws and score. Four minutes later, however, Sunderland were level through Stockton’s finest export, Nobbs, with Sophie Williams getting the assist. It set up a barn-storming finish to the game, with both sides pressing for the winner. And it was Nobbs who was decisive, crossing for Scoucer McDougall to score the winner with only a few minutes left on the clock. It was a monumental moment, a stand-out result in our club’s history, and to that point the greatest victory this young side had achieved.With two wins against the Londoners in two days, it was a brilliant weekend. Reflecting on the result in an interview with Roker Report - The Lasses Podcast earlier this year, defender Gemma Wilson, told the story of that season and this result in particular. I think that was their only defeat that year in the league, and only the second time they lost domestically in six years - they had an amazing, amazing side.Them coming up here and us looking for a result, looking to come out with three points, it was a massive change in mentality and culture within the club. We knew and we trusted who was in front of us, who was behind us, who was alongside us. You knew that if you made a mistake, you had two or three players who were there to pick it up, and we had that core through the spine of the team with experience, then we had the youth and the flare around us as well, and it was just an amazing, amazing year. We followed up this great victory with a 2-0 win over Chelsea, who we’d vanquished in the FA Cup Semi-Final at the Stadium of Light. We finished the season in fifth, winning 12 of the 24 league games we played. But the club’s lack of wholehearted support for the Lasses, not for the last time, would stand in the way of their continued progress. The club’s application to join the new and exclusive Women’s Super League was unsuccessful, and a generation of players moved on to bigger and better things. Nobbs had made her mark on Arsenal, not only in this game and the FA Cup Final, and Wilson knew that she would go on to be a superstar. If you asked me one player who I knew would make it, it was Jordan. There are some aspects of the game that you can train into people but there are some aspects of the game that are just within certain players, and that ability to read the game and that football intelligence is something that the likes of Jordan, Lucy [Bronze] and Lucy Stan[isforth], they had that already built in them, it was then just about making sure that they met the potential that was already there.  It took us another four years to get into the WSL, only for that dream to be ruined by yet another abandonment. Yet the dream of top having two-flight sides at Sunderland AFC is still there, it should be the driving ambition of the whole operation - it is rightly the expectation of many Lasses fans.Check your inbox for a welcome email.Oops.

As Cooper hobbled away, Chelsea quickly took the free kick; the pass to Johanna Rytting Kaneryd - although offside - was squared to Fran Kirby to put the Blues into an early lead after 15 minutes.The Reading bench, with access to the replays, were visibly disappointed and felt let down again by the officials. Phil Cousins, the Royals’ head coach, picked up a yellow card on 20 minutes when his frustration understandably boiled over.It was a shame and real blow for the Royals who started the first quarter of the match well and were equal to the league leaders. Emma Harries kept the captain’s armband throughout the night and put in a super performance. She forced the first Royals corner of the match, on 11 minutes, taking on Magdalena Eriksson down the left wing.From the resultant corner the ball was cleared to Tia Primmer who, after scoring from outside the penalty area against Liverpool, was confident enough to take on another ambitious effort – this time the teenager seeing her attempted lob just too high of the Chelsea crossbar.There were a couple of early scares for the Royals too. Jacqueline Burns was called into action in the first four minutes, her punched clearance fired back in by Chelsea and blocked on the near post by some great recovery defending by Gemma Evans.Reading enjoyed some good attacking down the right-hand side of the pitch. On 24 minutes Sanne Troelsgaard passed to Emma Harries whose right-foot cross was aimed for Lauren Wade at the near post, but was cleared by England international Millie Bright to safety.After some promising play, Reading found themselves 2-0 down just before the half-hour mark. Tia Primmer lost the ball just outside the Reading penalty area, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd’s shot hitting the upright and rebounding back across the penalty area for Jelana Cankovic to react the quickest and side foot into the Reading goal from close range.Within minutes the Royals looked like they may be in trouble when Jelana Cankovic scored her second goal of the evening, nodding home a cross from Erin Cuthbert from the right and put the home side into a commanding 3-0 lead.Apart from a long-range left-foot strike by Justine Vanhaevermaet, after another run and cross from the right by Emma Harries, it was the home side on the ascendancy. The score line remained 3-0 at half-time after some heroic defending and blocks by Gemma Evans and Faye Bryson, and some brave goalkeeping by Jacqueline Burns who needed treatment after a dive and clash with her own team mate.Team: Burns, Bryson, Cooper, Evans, Woodham, Vanhaevermaet, Primmer, Eikeland, Troelsgaard, Wade, HarriesAfter the victory last week against Tottenham Hotspur, Kelly Chambers rewarded the players with an unchanged starting 11 and kept faith with the same team for the start of the second half.Within minutes of the restart Deanna Cooper picked up the Royals’ first playing staff yellow card after sticking out a right leg to stop the Chelsea striker running into the penalty area. Cooper was almost immediately back in the action, this time using her head to deflect a shot from Erin Cuthbert.It was an injury that saw Kelly Chambers make her first substitution of the evening with Rachel Rowe replacing Tia Primmer who hobbled off the pitch.On the hour mark Reading got a lifeline after a cross from Emma Harries, on the right, was cleared by Euros champion Mille Bright, only as far as Sanne Troelsgaard. The Danish international still had a lot to do but managed to side step and get an early shot on goal, past the Chelsea goal keeper, Ann-Katrin Berger, who will have been disappointed to see that go under her body. 3-1.Within 60 seconds it was jubilation as the Royals scored again with a great move and finish down the right-hand side of the pitch. Sanne Troelsgaard’s pass found Rachel Rowe who, in turn, quickly found Emma Harries with her cross perfectly pulled back to Amalie Eikeland who scored Reading’s second goal of the night. 3-2, game on!Faye Bryson picked up a yellow card shortly before being replaced by Reading’s club captain Emma Mukandi - Kelly Chambers presumably looking for experience to try and salvage something out of the match. The third change saw Lauren Wade swapped for Charlie Wellings as the Royals pushed for an equaliser and one that would have been well deserved.Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, can’t have imagined she would have found her team in this position with 15 minutes to go and had to resort to bringing on three substitutes including the formidable Sam Kerr and Guro Reiten.Although there were five minutes of time added on, Chelsea managed to see out the match and, to their relief, finish as 3-2 winners.It was another entertaining game another great comeback attempt by the Royals but, all too similarly, the effort was unrewarded. I’m sure though that Kelly Chambers will have more to say about that.Chelsea, although pleased by the money from Sky, will surely be disappointed by the crowd of only 1,184 (if I heard correctly). Perhaps not a surprise with a kick-off of 6.45pm on a school night, just before Christmas, with sub-zero temperatures and a pitch that resembled a Dickensian Christmas Carol scene (with the assistant referee playing the part of Scrooge…)* 21+ (19+ CA-ONT) (18+ NH/WY).

80,"Sunderland have suffered from officials’ mistakes, but football can’t work without referees!",SB Nation,Rich Speight,2022-11-20,https://rokerreport.sbnation.com/2022/11/20/23468062/sunderland-have-suffered-from-officials-mistakes-but-football-cant-work-without-referees,"We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content and targeted ads, analyze site traffic, and understand where our audiences come from.

I was at the National Football Museum in Manchester a few weeks ago, and before my lad and I queued up for the video penalty shootout challenge (for the record, I was roundly beaten by a jubilant 12-year-old), we played the “You Are The Referee” game, based on the long-running feature in the Guardian newspaper.I was on much stronger ground with this non-physical activity. 30-odd years of watching as much footy as I can fit in added to a bookish childhood spent poring over the copy of the laws of the game found in an FA pocket diary, mean that I like to think that I’m pretty au fait with even the more obscure rules under which the world’s most popular team sport has been built.One of the questions in this quiz related to a famous incident - the beach ball incident against Liverpool at the Stadium of Light. I duly demonstrated my superior knowledge - of course, the goal never should have stood, but oh how we laughed... Sunderland had really had got away with one there! We sometimes forget the ref, Mike Jones, was demoted to the Championship as a punishment for the mistake. It was a genuine mistake, a human error, something that shouldn't have happened but something that has gone down in the folklore of Sunderland AFC and the Premier League more generally. Jones might never be able to live it down, but we wouldn't have changed it for the world.

  Then, just before my lad’s Under 13s game against his side’s local rivals this Saturday on a frosty 4G surface in my village, I was summonsed by one of the coaches. My heart sank as he opened his mouth, for I knew what was coming... would I be able to ref the game? Of course, I agreed. There were 20 boys and girls in their smart new kits, plus countless parents, brothers and sisters on the sidelines who’d dragged themselves out of bed on a cold November morning for this game. There was no way that my reluctance to run up and down the pitch for 70 minutes, whistleless, cardless, making honest but sketchy calls on offsides, free kicks, and penalties (I gave two penalties - one to each side - both disputed) - decisions that would likely colour the rest of these youngsters’ weekends - was going to be enough to stop me from agreeing. I was absolutely knackered afterwards, you can’t stop and you really have to concentrate. That there was no actually trained, qualified, and equipped official at the game was hardly a rarity - there will be people reading this who ref their kids’ games regularly and probably do a much better job than I did - but I can say that when there is a proper referee it makes a hell of a difference to the experience for everyone. They’re able to talk players through the match, ensure everyone is clear about why decisions have been given, and take up the right positions on the field, so they can make decisions -  or at the very least not find themselves in the line of a throw-in. We also know that there’s a horrible tendency, thankfully one I didn’t have to endure this weekend, for those who do put themselves forward to officiate at youth football and the adult grassroots game to be verbally abused and even physically assaulted for having the temerity to facilitate the application of the rules of the game as they see it. Indeed, I assume it is more likely for a “proper” neutral ref to face abuse and intimidation, a stand-in parent is less likely to face overly competitive coaches, know-it-all parents or hormonal, immature kids getting in their faces and threatening them than someone wearing a full black kit with the FA badge who brandished a red card to little Jimmy or Jenny for denying a goalscoring opportunity. What has this got to do with the ever-present concern about the quality of decision-making in the professional game in general and some of the concerns of Sunderland supporters this season in particular? Well, for a start, the abuse of referees from players and spectators is clearly “learned behaviour”. It’s obviously cultural, it’s something that is copied and carried down through the tiers and the age groups from the professional ranks. What people see at the top levels - and this goes for adults as well as kids - is copied when they’re in the park or on the school 4G pitch.This is something that happens throughout our game but doesn’t happen in other football codes - particularly in rugby. The question as to why this is the case has been asked many times with a variety of answers, but for me, all roads ultimately lead back to us, the paying fans of professional football clubs watching in the stands or at home on pay TV. I am part of this culture, at Sunderland men’s and women’s matches or at England internationals I am as likely as anyone reading this to be amongst the thousands vocally disagreeing with the calls I see made by the ref. But I was brought up with the belief that, over the course of a season, the individual incidents will even themselves out for any given club and that, ultimately, trusting in the impartiality and honesty of referees is really important. It means that the players, coaches, and owners of the club we love have to take ownership of results and that at the end of the season, the table doesn’t lie. And I rarely leave a game thinking that the reason the Lads or the Lasses haven’t got the result we wanted was because of poor refereeing, even if that obvious penalty for handball that wasn’t given to the women’s side the other week at Blackburn still narks, as does the penalty Jack Clarke didn’t get at Ewood too. The old maxim that, if you’re relying on an offside call or a spot kick for three points, then you’ve really not done enough to deserve them, still applies for the most part. That’s not to say that there are no major issues with refereeing in English football today. We’re all very aware of those times when the impartiality of referees has been questioned. It’s not just at the extremes like the Serie A corruption scandals to accusations and suspicions of impropriety at the 2002 World Cup, although it is certainly is still a potential issue when the rewards of taking a bribe are a lot higher than the money on offer.We hear every week in the Premier League claims that the full-time professional referees - the elite - are more likely to side with one of the “Big 6” European Super League scab clubs over their less illustrious challengers. In the EFL Championship, we’ve been on the receiving end of a few well-below-par refereeing decisions this season that, if they had gone the other (the correct) way, would probably have seen us stilling very close to if not inside the playoff places right now. In the Women’s Championship, we have amateur referees overseeing an increasingly fast-paced, physically demanding, and professional game. These are people - sometimes young women themselves - who have other jobs and commitments and are often travelling long distances to take games for not that much money, and so the mistakes they make need to be set in that context.However, unless there are more referees coming through in grassroots football, which is the lifeblood of our whole game, then the pool of talent from which the elite level officials are drawn will be anaemic. Refs at the top will be left with little competition, with the inability of those who are performing poorly to be replaced with the sharp eyes and minds of the up-and-coming.  But this begs the question: who would be a ref these days, and how on earth do we bring through future generations of high-ranked officials into the game? I’ve heard suggestions that the problem is that refereeing attracts officious pernickety characters, those with authoritarian mindsets, the power-hungry or even those with sadomasochistic tendencies. It’s claimed by some that they deserve the dog’s abuse they receive and more, that they’re all “Little Hitlers” who get a kick from ruining matches. My view of the world is not so dark and cynical.99 percent of those who take the field to adjudicate games are doing so simply because they love football, they want to be involved in football, and they know that, without their commitment, football would not exist. The sixth-former who turns up on a weekend or after school to take an under 10s game is unlikely to be a megalomanic, they’re simply the kind of community-minded young person that we’d all want our brothers, sisters, children or grandchildren to be. But it's these kids who are being chased away - sometimes literally - by the arseholes shouting from the sidelines up and down this country.Yes, at the very top level the refereeing teams are paid and they can concentrate on improving and refining all aspects of their performance so that they can keep up with the unbelievable pace and power of the contemporary game, but this time and these resources are only available to a small minority. All those who do make it as pro-referees have come through the ranks while pursuing other careers - jobs that they’ve chosen to leave in order to reach the peak of football officialdom.Yet we all still see the issues, week in week out. Inconsistency in decision-making is the most consistent concern that we hear from fellow fans, closely followed by a worry that the man or woman in the middle are only interested in their own ego or being the centre of attention, or are on the other hand overawed by the big occasion. Accusations of actual conscious bias are rare, although the suspicion that some clubs get an easier ride than others has and always will be there. I don’t have many solutions to the problem of quality in the upper ranks. Some sensibly suggest that we need to find ways to get more former footballers to make the move across the divide and take charge of games, they know how the game needs to be controlled and can communicate from a position of empathy and knowledge with their peers. But on a practical level this becomes difficult - even in the professional game the money on offer is unlikely to be attractive to all but the most altruistic of former footballers - their own misdemeans and rivalries from their playing careers will haunt them wherever they go. I am ambivalent when it comes to VAR. Personally, I think it has the potential to work, and when applied correctly can lead to the right decisions being made. But it needs to be refined and improved to get more consistency and with speed, because getting the right decision in a sport where the rewards are counted in the hundreds of millions of pounds is very important. It’s important because, if people don’t believe in the system, if they think its rigged, if they think it’s unfair, then they will become angrier and angrier, and the vicious circle that leads to 16-year-old referees being attacked in park football will continue to whirl out of control.   There has been a very welcome decline of blind deference in our society over the past few decades. Questioning officialdom, critical thinking, and demanding fairness and evidence rather than tipping your cap to those who’ve been placed in authority is part of the modern democratic world. Unaccountable and entrenched authority, based on nothing more than tradition and seniority, is almost always a bad thing. But fairness for all, particularly those without so much money and power, also requires clear and consistently applied rules and impartial arbiters. And we should always be open to learning from others and applying these lessons to our own situations. So maybe we need to mic up with referees in the Premier League, the WSL and the men’s and women’s Championship, so that those watching on the TV and even in the stands know why a decision has been made. It’s what happens in rugby, where someone of the diminutive stature of Nigel Owens is able to give a thorough dressing down to two 17 stone props and explain the often perplexing laws of that version of football to the thousands in the grounds and millions watching on the telly at the same time. Perhaps if we’re able to hear the discussions between the referee and the players, and the on-field ref and the VAR or Fourth Official, then we will all learn a lot more about why a particular rule has been applied (or not applied) to a particular scenario, and some of the more egregious abuse that stems from the top and filters to the bottom will be halted. Almost all controversy has been removed from cricket by the video referral system, and I think football should become open to allowing coaches or captains to request VAR look at a limited number of incidents during a game once the ball is out of play (the awarding of a corner, for example, or a second yellow card, which currently cannot be examined but which could change the course of a game). A reformed VAR, with more input and explanation, could be transformative to modern football’s often toxic culture. Sunlight may well be the most effective disinfectant.
