0,Fulham v Manchester United: Premier League – live,The Guardian,Alex Hess,2022-11-13T15:47:29Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/nov/13/fulham-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live,"Alejandro Garnacho broke Fulham hearts with a last-gasp winner at Craven CottageHere’s our report from Craven Cottage. And that’s all from me. Thanks for reading!And that’s that. At the end of a terrific, hard-fought game, Fulham taste defeat undeservedly but Garnacho has announced his arrival with a match-winning cameo. A terrifically well-worked goal, too, he and Eriksen staying ice-cool under pressure to slickly prise open Fulham’s backline.United win it in the last minute of added-time. Again United attack down the left, this time Eriksen charging forward and playing a one-two-three with Garnacho, who is suddenly through on goal. The Argentinian prods home an calm left-foot finish to decide the game!90 mins: Casemiro pokes the ball into the box, Ream flicks it on and Fernandes meets it at the back to to send a header across the face of goal. It’s begging for an attacker to tap it in, but there’s no one there and Fernandes appears to take that as a personal insult. Cairney is replaced by Onomah.88 mins: Every United attack today seems to have gone through Shaw. This time the left-back lifts an early cross into McTominay on the edge of the box. This time the midfielder gets his header right, but he’s too far out and Leno saves. Fulham break through James, whose low cross from the right is turned behind by Lindelof at full stretch.86 mins: Palhinha, magnificent today, breaks up a promising United attack with a ferocious sliding tackle on Rashford and wins a free-kick for his side to boot. 82 mins: Some very tidy passing out from the back from United before McTominay sells Palhinha a dummy and switches play to Garnacho. He frees Shaw on the overlap and the fullback’s cross picks out McTominay for what would be a glorious team goal … but the midfielder sends a free header wide. Great chance!80 mins: Fulham win a free-kick on the right. Pereira takes and, seeing Palhinha pulling away, gives his teammate a free header – but the Portuguese misjudges and send the ball well over.78 mins: James again escapes down the right, this time electing not to beat Martinez but instead going for the early cross, belted away by the backtracking Lindelof.74 mins: Garnacho picks up the ball on the left and drives dangerously into the box, falling under the challenge of Decordova-Reid. No penalty. A minute later, he does the same thing again, this time without the penalty claim. He’s livened United up.71 mins: James streak down the right leaving Martinez for dead, but doubles back rather than crossing and his eventual ball into the box is cut out. United send on Garnacho for Martial.69 mins: Martial drops deep to gather the ball and looks to pick out Rashford who is haring down the left, but Fulham’s defence shuts the door on him. Casemiro picks up the ball and heaves a long ball back towards Martial, who watches forlornly as it sails over his head.65 mins: Fulham are hungry for a second. A spell of prolonged pressure culminates with Casemiro heading a Robinson cross over his own bar.Don’t say I didn’t warn you. Fulham spring forward when Robinson’s early ball to Willian sets the Brazilian scampering free down the left. He carries, carries, then waits until just the right moment to release to the overlapping Cairney, who low left-foot cross invites the former United man to tap home. He obliges.59 mins: Narrative alert: Daniel James comes on for Harry Wilson.58 mins: Another Fulham attack makes it as far as Vinicius before fizzling out. They relaunch down the right, from where Pereira whips in a great deep cross that Malacia sees out for a corner.55 mins: Change for United – Elanga goes off, McTominay on. 51 mins: Wilson burrows down the right and squeezes in a low cross towards Vinicius at the back post. He spins and batters a left-foot shot but it’s straight at De Gea, who repels it wide. The corner is worked to Cairney, who floats in a cross to Ream at the back stick. The defender meets it powerfully but again De Gea is there is palm the ball over.50 mins: Martial works Leno again with a 20-yard snapshot, but it’s too close to the keeper who gathers easily.48 mins: Fernandes looks to the inside left channel and slips in Elaga, whose early low effort is well saved by Leno. Rashford follows up but his shot can’t get through a wall of defensive bodies.47 mins: Willian feeds Vinicius on the left, and the Brazilian’s low cross is cut out by Lindelof before it can reach Pereira. When the corner comes in, the ball is half-cleared and breaks to Cairney on the edge of the box, but he slices wildly over.46 mins: And we’re back under way. Fulham kick off and attempt a couple of route-one attacks, both curtailed by Lindelof.Kari Tulinius writes: “Manchester United players are oddly static. If memory serves, Ten Hag’s Ajax were always in motion, but United stand around a lot. Though it might be because the United players are conserving energy for the World Cup.”Half-time reading, from elsewhere in the Premier League:And that’s the last action of a lively half. Fulham have showed lots of attacking ambition without truly creating much. United have picked their moments to strike and could be two up. Get the kettle on.45 mins: Shaw, probably United’s best player this half, marauds forward and is tugged back by Palhinha, who escapes a booking. Then Martinez sweeps the ball forward to Elanga, whose smart backheel finds Fernandes on the corner of the box. He squares for Eriksen who times his arrival perfectly but, from the penalty spot, sends a simple finish the wrong side of the post41 mins: United mount a decent attack, Rashford laying back to Shaw whose clipped first-time cross find Martial, but the striker’s glanced header flashes just over.40 mins: Lindelof, spooked by the Fulham press, passes the ball straight out of play. Fulham work it forward again but the attack breaks down with Vinicius who, not for the first time, fails to hold the ball up.38 mins: Fernandes tries a silly flick in his own half, Fulham pounce and Pereira swings in a nicely shaped cross which is seen out for another corner. United are officially under the cosh.34 mins: Another dangerous Willian cross is headed away by a United centre-half. My kingdom for a Serbian target man. Then Robinson hurtles down the same flank to win a corner – Malacia clearly being targeted here – which is hung up for a blazing volley that Willian shanks high and wide.33 mins: Willian, Fulham’s best attacker so far, wriggles away down the left once again and fires in a cross which Martinez heads clear. As Rashford tears away upfield, Reid is booked for stopping him in his tracks.30 mins: Eriksen picks out Rashford on te left, who nudges the ball infield, where a hole has opened up in Fulham defence. Martial, realising he’s in on goal, gets a shot away which squirms through Leno’s legs, but loses enough pace in doing so for the keeper to scamper back and stop it from crossing the line.29 mins: Wilson tries his luck again, shimmying in from the right and bending one from 20 yards which De Gea beats away two-fisted. Good fun this.26 mins: Pereira spins brilliantly away from Martinez on the edge of the box and slides the ball in behind the United defence for Wilson, whose stretches to divert to goalwards. De Gea saves instinctively before the flag goes up against Wilson – a tight one. 23 mins: The game has settled into a patter of Fulham probing patiently and United looking to spring on the break. Palhinha cuts a United counter short with a terrific tackle on Elanga, who had escaped down the right.20 mins: Willian involved again, this time jinking in from the left and attempting the long-range curler. It flies well wide. United go up the other end of the pitch and Fernandes’s glorious deep cross picks out Rashford alone at the back post. It arrives at at awkward height for Rashford, who fluffs the finish – but was offside.19 mins: Pereira picks up the ball on the edge of the box and lays off to the onrushing Willian. He hits the byline but his pull-back can’t find a white shirt.18 mins: Casemiro tries a shot from his own half. It goes nowhere near the goal. Not the sort of intervention he was bought for.Cairney is caught in possession by Casemiro on halfway and in a flash, Martial charges forward, feeds Fernandes down the inside left and the Portuguese squares across the six-yard box for Eriksen to tap home. Casemiro started that with the sort of unshowy intervention he was bought for.13 mins: Rashford channels Ronaldinho, trying to beat Decordova-Reid with an elastico. It doesn’t quite come off – good fun though.11 mins: Fulham turn the screw. Willian scampers forward but can’t quite feed Vinicius in the box, before Robinson drifts in a back-post cross which Shaw scrambles clear.9 mins: United’s first meaningful attack comes as Shaw bends a ball down the line for Rashford, who advances into the area and lays off to Martial. For a second he has a sight of goal, but tries to dart through two defenders and is crowded out.7 mins: Fulham are looking to attack down their left. After Wilson switches play nicely, Palhinha wrestles Malacia to the ground but his floated cross sails out for a goal kick.5 mins: Eriksen is caught on the ball by Palhinha, kickstarting smart Fulham attack that ends with Vinicius’s low drive forcing a characteristic save-with-the-legs by De Gea.3 mins: Robinson gallops down the left and is felled, fairly, by the earnest Elanga who has tracked back diligently.1 min: Casemiro ends a period of scrappy play by funnelling the ball out to Malacia, who is starting at right-back to offend all our aesthetic sensibilities.After a minute’s silence for Remembrance Sunday, we’re ready to go. United to kick off.If we’re including Old Trafford fixtures, we’d have Fulham’s Inamoto-inspired dethroning of the champions in October 2003, right? Meanwhile, back in the real world, the teams are out.Alex Ross chips in: “I’ll offer Fulham 3-0 Man U at the Cottage in December 2009. Roy Hodgson’s Fulham were three days removed from a delirious and snowy 3-2 win away at Basel, confirming our place in the knock-outs of the Europa League. Bobby Zamora and Zoltan Gera were unplayable. It was my birthday.”“What about Van Nistelrooy’s sensational solo goal?” asks Edward Taylor. I mean, it was at Old Trafford so not strictly the same fixture but I’ll give you it nonetheless. Was that the least Van Nistelrooyish goal Van Nistelrooy ever scored? And has a footballer ever run the length of the pitch, leaving defenders trailing in his wake, at such hilariously slow speed?Some highlights – off the top of my head – from this fixture over the years. February 2007: Cristiano Ronaldo scores a ludicrous late solo goal to secure a vital win en route to the title. March 2009: Wayne Rooney punches the corner flag on his way to the tunnel having been sent off in a 2-0 defeat. February 2014: Darren Bent starts hammering the nail into the coffin of the David Moyes era with a 95th-minute equaliser to make it 2-2. Any more for any more?Pre-match reading: Our Manchester correspondent runs the rule over Ten Hag’s tenure so farIs there a more jarring sight in football than a team fielding two left-backs? Other than that, Ten Hag’s team looks a good one: guile and know-how in midfield, pace and versatility up front. What looks good on paper doesn’t always play well in practice, though – especially for United.Marco Silva gives Tom Cairney his first Premier League start of the season, a sign, perhaps, that he intends to get at United with probing possession rather than anything more direct. Andreas Pereira, on the mark against United’s neighbours last weekend, starts against his former club.Fulham: Leno, Decordova-Reid, Ream, Diop, Robinson, Palhinha, Cairney, Andreas, Wilson, Vinicius, Willian.Subs: Rodák, Tosin, Duffy, Chalobah, James, Onomah, Mbabu, Harris, SekularacMan United: De Gea, Lindelof, Martinez, Malacia, Shaw, Fernandes, Eriksen, Casemiro, Elanga, Martial, Rashford. Subs: Bishop, Dubravka, Maguire, Fred, McTominay, Van de Beek, Iqbal, GarnachoIt was all going so well. Manchester United’s toothless loss to Aston Villa last weekend brought an end to an nine-game unbeaten that featured seven wins, six clean sheets and one remarkable period of totaalvoetbal with Harry Maguire up front.Meek defeat at Villa Park a week ago may have given a snapshot of a team without a clue, but the truth is that Erik ten Hag’s tenure so far has for the large part been quietly impressive. Context is everything, and United’s current position of fifth looks far better when you consider that the club remains badly burdened by unremarkable talents and ageing egotists (and that’s just the boardroom!).A win on the banks of the Thames would see Ten Hag’s men enter the not-quite-half-term break three points off the Champions League spots with a game in hand: not bad at all.Marco Silva’s Fulham, meanwhile, will climb to within a point of United with a win today. They have been the division’s surprise package, and not many would be too shocked by a home win today for a side who like to give the heavyweights a proper game: Fulham went toe to toe with Liverpool on the opening day and would have two more points were it not for last-gasp goals from Arsenal and Manchester City.They’ll have to do it without their talisman Aleksandar Mitrovic, who is out with a foot injury, though Booby Decordova-Reid returns from suspension. For United, Bruno Fernandes is back while Cristiano Ronaldo and Antony are doubts."

2,Brighton v Aston Villa: Premier League – live,The Guardian,Daniel Harris,2022-11-13T13:16:31Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/nov/13/brighton-v-aston-villa-premier-league-live,"Villa survived the concession of a first-minute goal to record their second win in Unai Emery’s second league gameWhich means we’re done here. Thanks for your company and comments – enjoy the rest of the weekend and see you for the World Cup! Aha, here’s Sam Dalling’s match report.I guess one advantage of Villa’s formation is that they’re unlikely to be outnumbered in central areas. It’s one thing to offer a team the flanks, but quite another for that team to get the ball to them, then back into central areas in order to make and taker a goalscoring opportunity. Also for your pleasure:With Brighton, it seems like to score, they have to do too many things perfectly too much of the time. And that’s not just because they don’t have the money to buy Robert Lewandowski, or whoever – it’s a facility of their style, which is based on intricate passing. Perhaps they need to tweak things so they’ve a bit more edge and speed out wide, wingers who play more in the style of Caicedo and Mac Allister – and they also need to get Tariq Lamptey into the starting XI, as one of them if necessary. The thing about Villa is how many options they have. That means that Emery will be able to pick particular players for particular opponents – for so accomplished a tactician, that’s very helpful – and also that, when things aren’t going well, he’ll be able to change games from the bench. The more I think about it, the more he’s an ideal fit for the job. Also for your delectation:We have, of course, got more football for you this afternoon, and it should be another decent game. Join Alex Hess here:That is, by the way, Villa’s first away league win of the season. The way the players celebrated at the end showed how much it meant to them, and they’ll be gutted that their momentum stops here. “Parts of the edge of the box are closer to the penalty spot than 10 yards,” emails Like Nicholas, “hence the D on that part of the box. It’s simple geometry really.”Ha, yes – I’ve grasped the radius of a circle aspect, I’m just wondering what difference it makes when no player can enter the box until the ball’s been struck (in theory). “I look forward to seeing Danny Ings lift the Europa League trophy,” emails Blair Enns. “He deserves it.”That was, as expected, a proper quantity of fun. Villa are going to get better quickly, while Brighton’s search for a goalscorer … goes on. But we don’t! Villa win and rise from 15th to 12th! What a start they’ve made under Emery; Brighton stay seventh. 90+8 min Matinez and Dunk go brow-to-brow and Martinez is booked; there’s now a pleasing tetch suffusing every second, and I’d not be shocked to see scuffles at full-time. We should also get more than eight minutes added time.90+7 min McGinn is now down with cramp, which alters me to the shortness of his shorts. An old-skool footballer in the truest sense – I bet Barry Bannan wears them too. 96 min Young’s done well since coming on – that was a smart change from Emery – and after Gross and Trossard exchange passes, he zooms back to get in a telling tackle. 90+5 min You get the feeling Brighton know they’re not going to score. McGinn wins a free-kick halfway inside their half on the left, manages to delay its taking by shouting about who knows what, and there goes another minute. 90+4 min “Six-yard box,” beigs colin Young. “I think that’s for where the goalie can take a goal kick from? The D is to make sure players don’t encroach on penalties, closer than 10 yards.”Aha, I did not know that. But I don’t know if i get the penalty aspect, as they can’t do anything until the ball is kicked, or is that with rebounds in mind? 90+2 min “Kavanagh really does have his very own way of interpreting the rules,” emails Peter Littley. A” picture of inconsistency, Mings gets one yellow after two identical tackles, penalty given for dragging a leg into a defenders leg then no penalty for a defender missing his tackle and the ball but taking out the forward. Yellow card for the same time-wasting that has been going on for the entire game. Is it only time-wasting after a certain point in a game? No wonder Premier League referee’s aren’t regarded as top quality.”It’s not just the refs, I don’t think – the laws are poorly drafted, and the game is very fast. But what baffles me is the time-keeping, as I keep saying, and the calls made when we can clearly see evidence to the contrary. 90+1 min Brighton have won loads of corners and here comes another, from the right … which Cash, who’s played well today, stoops to head clear. 90 min I take it back – we will apparently, have eight minutes of injury-time. Good. 88 min Lamptey has added some zip to Brighton – I’m not certain why he didn’t start – and after he wins a corner that’a only partial cleared, Gross whips in a terrific cross and Colwill’s underneath it!, alone! But he doesn’t quite judge the flight, getting up too early so forced to contort body to try and head home, only to prang wide instead.87 min Bailey wins Villa a corner, McGinn goes short to him, and he streaks along the line and cuts back for Young, who drills wide of the near post. 86 min “On your 73rd minute suggestion,” emails Ric Arthur, “if that were enacted, what would be the point of the penalty area? It would be redundant.”I can cope with that, but it’d still be useful for distance purpose. On which point, what does the six-yard box do, or the D?85 min Kamara races in, leaps, and introduces studs to Mac Allister’s boot. He’s booked, and actually, does rather well to avoid anything more. Villa have disappeared the time here with a great deal of cynicism and wildness; we should get about an hour of added time here, but stand by four the usual four. 84 min This is getting fractious, Lamptey doing really well to dash across Young, who hacks him down, back gardern-style. 83 min Triple change for Villa, Ings, Digne ad Luiz departing with Archer, Augustinsson and Dendoncker arriving. 82 min Gross is booked for something or other, mouth I think, then De Zerbi is as well. Brighton are already peeved about the penalty that wasn’t and now the timewasting is absolutely doing their collective swede. 81 min Another change for Brighton, the explosive Lamptey replacing Estupinan. 80 min Bailey is booked then Brighton get it forward and Trossard, 23 yards out, ducks onto his right foot and laces a drive for which Martinez has to dive, but not very far, and he hangs on easily enough. 79 min Cash is booked for timewasting at a throw, on which point, the single thing we could do to improve the game would be to stop the clock when the ball goes dead and show the time on the scoreboard for everyone to follow. Mucking about would still halt momentum, but at least we’d get our 90 minutes; currently, how those are administered is a total mystery. 76 min “How is that not a penalty?” wonders Gary Brown. “Solly March absolutely clattered, no wonder people espouse theories of bias against their teams. I have no favourites in this game but it was a clear error by the referee. The system is broken.”No one is biased, I don’t think – though it seems unlikely there are no preconceived ideas lurking in officials’ mind, people being people – but yup, it can be impossible to fathom certain calls and that’s one of them. It reminded me of the penalty Man United didn’t get against Newcastle when Longstaff fouled Sancho – tame and missable at first glance, but when seen again, absolutely obvious. We have to be allowed to hear the conversations between officials, as we do in rugby union and cricket. 74 min Another change for Villa, Bailey for Buendia. 73 min I’ve said before that part of the problem with the game is the kind of offence for which a penalty – so a goal roughly 80% of the time – is awarded. It should be given for any offence, anywhere on the pitch, that stops a proper goalscoring opportunity, and for an infringement in the box which does not, a direct free-kick is plenty. But another problem is not being able to hear the deliberations when VAR is involved – for the crowd in the ground, for us at home, and to make sure we understand why things are happening.71 min Eesh, we see a challenge from a second again which Digne tried to clear as March came in to tackle. VAR is investigating, but it’s not totally clear whether March got to the ball before Digne … but from the angle we’re looking at now, from behind the defender, March gets a foot on it, then Digne whacks through him! That’s a penalty all day long, apart from on Sunday 13 November. VAR says no! i’ve no idea why! 69 min Yup, Young is now at right-back with Cash shuffling along which makes sense – Brighton have been good down the left. But in the meantime, Gross makes ground down the other flank and clips back, but Caicedo, arriving with decent timing, can’t quite take the ball in stride and Villa clear. 68 min Emery is nothing if not practical and pragmatic; he sends on Young for Ramsey, so might be changing to a back five. 67 min Since going behind, Brighton have had 78% possession. That doesn’t tell us loads – Villa are sitting a little deeper – but the home side are passing it nicely; has anyone ever wondered how good they might get if they had a reliable goalscorer? 66 min Lovely from Brighton, Colwill easing out with the ball and sliding a fine pass inside McGinn for Estupinan, whose cross is sent behind by Mings. That’s good defending, and the corner is then cleared easily enough. 64 min I’ve been really impressed with Villa’s mentality this last week. They started so quickly against Man United then conceded a fluke on the stroke of half-time after which United started to move the ball with tempo. So Villa won it off them, broke in devastating style, and scored a lovely clincher, while today, they’ve ridden the concession of a soul-crushing goal to roar back. 63 min Eeesh, Cash stretches into a tackle with Caicedo, misses the ball, and leaves studs on Caicedo. It’s a right sair yin, but I think he’ll be fine. 60 min I’m sure Ings is pretty happy with life at the moment, but I do wonder how his career might’ve gone had he had better luck with injuries. At his best, he has that rare ability to occupy a defence on his own, and I doubt there’s any centre-back pairing or triumvirate that’d look forward to facing him and Watkins in tandem. I’m sure that’s part of the thinking behind Emery’s 4-2-2-2 formation – the question is balancing the team in that context. Perhaps if Ings drops off he can make an extra man in midfield, because those two with wingers spells goals. 59 min Bunedia is hurt, so while he’s treated Brighton make a double change, Veltman and Undav replacing Welbeck and Enciso, himself on as sub. 57 min Buendia gets away from Caicedo, who crunches him like so many Frosties, as Raymond Chandler didn’t write, and is booked. Villa maintain pressure and, in a role-reversal of Brighton’s opener, Luiz robs Mac Allister high, the ball squirts out to Ings who sends Dunk off to the beach, twisting away from him as he slides in, then with Sanchez expecting a far-post finish, snaps gently through Colwill’s legs and a deflection takes it inside the near!54 min Anyway, there’s some football going on, and it’s good football! Cash nashes down the right, clips back and Buendia dives into a fine header – think the body-shape of Van Persie v Spain – that clatters the post!52 min Brighton look much more assured playing out from the back, which makes sense – the team has been put together with that in mind, and they’ve been doing it for longer. They work it nicely on this occasion too, the ball ending up with Sanchez again but with space created so that he can punch a pass down the middle ad into Mac Allister. Increasingly, top-level football seems to be about that, forcing opponents into areas to then exploit the space. And no, I’m not saying this is a new invention, rather that it’s a more fundamental part of the game than before. 50 min Trossard shoves Cash rather than contest a high ball, before spinning to thunk a tremendous finish from outside the box, left-hand side, in off the underside of the bar. He’s another who does, I think, have very serious and significant potential. 48 min This time next week, Moises Caicedo will be getting ready to play for Ecuador in the opening game of the World Cup. That is, of course, both odd and wrong, but I really like the look of him, and if looks to have all the ability to develop into an all-round midfielder in both old and new-skool tradition. 47 min It’s a strange thing, given the openness of the game, but we’ve not actually seen that many chances. I wonder if, as the teams tire, we see more of them but less quality, but in the meantime there’s a game going on, March nipping around the side of Villa to cross; Villa get the ball away. 46 min The ball goes back to Martinez, who dwells on it, but under pressure from Trossard, he lashes clear. 46 min We go again!Our teams rejoin us…Half-time email: “Pretty sure Paul Draper of Mansun once said that the song Wide Open Space was inspired while watching football on ITV and Brian Moore commentating on a game,” says Paul Jeary. My sulphuric-addled brain isn’t totally certain whether this is said for our information or ironically, but I’d love for it to be the former. Though were that so, I’d have expected the track to be called “And it’s it in there!”Little bit of half-time World Cup news, and it is, I’m afraid, an absolute sickener. It’s almost as if sticking the competition in the middle of the season is a horrendous piece of behaviour. BREAKING: Ghana's first choice goalkeeper JoJo Wollacott has been ruled out of the World Cup after he fractured his finger before Charlton's game yesterday.#GhanaSoccerNet #WorldCup2022 pic.twitter.com/GdDqcIe4neI’ve not a clue what’s going to happen after the break. Both sides have shown enterprise in attack, intensity in midfield and fallibility at the back, so there’s pretty much no outcome – result or winning margin, if indeed we get a winner – that would be surprising. I’m off to clear my head of sulphuric acid, but see you in 10 for more fun. "

4,Newcastle United v Chelsea: Premier League – live,The Guardian,Will Magee,2022-11-12T17:26:17Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/nov/12/newcastle-united-v-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-updates,"A second-half strike from Joe Willock was enough to secure victory for Newcastle against an uninspired Chelsea side.Time to wrap things up, then. Thanks to all those who wrote in. The last word goes to Ryan Price, who got some insight on the origins of the term “stonewall” from Martin in Zürich. “Tell Martin to email me, I live in Zürich too.” Football live blogs, forging friendships since 2022.Here’s Louise Taylor’s report from St James’ Park, for those looking for some extra reading.Here’s another stat which makes grim reading for Chelsea. This is the first time they have lost three games on the bounce in all competitions since 2002 (excluding matches decided by penalty shootout).Chris Waddle, the former Newcastle midfielder, is jubilant over on BBC Radio 5 Live. “Newcastle deserved it,” he says. “That bit of pushing and shoving from Chelsea was the most fight we have seen from them all night.”What are Opta saying? They know their stats, there’s no denying it.3 - Newcastle will be in the Premier League’s top three at Christmas for the first time since the 2001-02 season, when they were top of the table on Christmas Day (later went on to finish 4th). Serious. pic.twitter.com/o8oss5i34xWhen was the last time Chelsea went five games without a win in the league? Glad you asked. It was in 2012 under the stewardship of Roberto Di Matteo and Rafa Benítez. Oof.The final whistle goes and there’s a predictable bout of pushing and shoving as Chelsea’s frustrations boil over. They will go into the winter break on a run of five league games without a win, while Newcastle leapfrog Tottenham into third.90+7 min Longstaff is booked for a spicy challenge. Jamaal Lascelles is booked on the sidelines for dissent.90+6 min Burn barges over Havertz off the ball and Mendy comes up for the ensuing free kick. It’s cleared and Newcastle counter through Joelinton, but Cucurella comes across to dispossess him before he can lob the ball into the empty net.90+5 min Pope is booked, seemingly for saying something naughty.90+4 min Chelsea move the ball from side to side but can’t find a way through. Koulibaly plays a desperate long ball up to Havertz, but Newcastle defend it well.90+2 min Joelinton takes it to the corner. It’s that stage of the match for Newcastle.An interesting observation from Paul Fitzgerald via email. “Havertz looks like a great technician who scores too many odd goals, and as a result lives in a striker/midfield wasteland.”90 mins There’ll be seven minutes of injury time here. Can Chelsea dig out an equaliser?88 min Koulibaly goes into the book after scything down Almirón to the right of the area. Trippier steps up, but his delivery fails to find a teammate.86 min Botman goes down with a knock. Howe brings on Matt Targett in his place.84 min Howe makes his second substitution, bringing off Willock for Murphy.83 min Kovacic loses the ball in midfield, then chops down Wilson in an attempt to get it back. Jones opts against a booking.80 min Nerves for Newcastle! Chelsea look much sharper in possession, moving the ball about at pace. It comes to Cucurella out wide on the left and he pings a cross to the near post, where Havertz ghosts in but fails to connect. There’s a scramble in the area before the hosts finally lump it clear.78 min Pulisic makes inroads down the left and whips a cross into the box, but Burn clears at the cost of a corner. Havertz climbs highest, but heads wide.75 min Newcastle make their first change, Wilson coming on for Wood as Howe looks to kill the game.74 min Sorry, make that a triple substitution. Havertz is on for Broja.73 min Potter makes a double substitution, bringing on Cucurella and Hakim Ziyech for Hall and Mount.71 min Longstaff is down after a tackle from Hall. It’s a painful one, but it looks like he’ll be OK to continue.Another contribution on the origins of “stonewall”, this time from Martin in Zürich. “I can help Ryan with that one. A stone wall is something very solid, so claiming a stonewall pen is a shout without doubt. Surely a much clearer case than stone cold. Whatever that is supposed to mean.”At last, we have our opener. Almirón latches on to a bouncing ball, escapes Kalidou Koulibaly, controls it twice with his head and dribbles it over to Willock, who casually curls it into the back of the net.64 min Good save! Gallagher jinks forwards on the edge of the area and unleashes a shot which Pope pushes round the post with his fingertips. That’s Chelsea’s best chance of the match so far.From Jim McKendrick on Twitter: “Trippier is booked for bringing down Pulisic as he tries to break. Do we call this nominative determinism?” Very good.62 min Broja makes his way up the left flank, but paints himself into a corner. Chelsea keep the ball and Kovacic has a go from just outside the box, but it’s blocked.Back on Twitter – how are things going over there? All fine? – we’ve had a helpful contribution on the origins of “stonewall penalty”.@W_F_Magee RE: ""a stonewall penalty""https://t.co/a9gGESTthZ57 min Danger! Willock gets in behind on the left and whips the ball across the face of goal. Hall is forced into a desperate intervention, stabbing it behind for a corner after it narrowly evades Wood. Howe has his hands on his head on the sidelines.56 min Trippier is booked for bringing down Pulisic as he tries to break. 55 min Chelsea try to calm things down, but only invite more pressure. Mendy continues to look uncomfortable with the ball.More correspondence, this time from Ryan Price. “How happy I was to read Brian Robson mentioning “stone cold”. My biggest bug bear is pundits going on about a “stonewall” penalty. What on earth (I’m being polite) does that mean?”50 min So close! Trippier gets in a menacing cross which is headed down by Joelinton. Wood latches on to it, but Mendy saves at point-blank range. Guimarães has a crack on the follow-up, but it’s blocked. Newcastle recycle the ball and Almirón tees up Longstaff, but he fires over.49 min The two sides have picked up where they left off, making a choppy start to the second half. Broja is bullied off the ball as he looks to get up the pitch.There’s been a half-time change for Chelsea, with Potter bringing on Christian Pulisic for Azpilicueta.We’re back in action at St James’ Park.Finally, a self-confessed rant from Brian Robson (not that one). “That was a stone-cold penalty with an arm dragging away from his body and stopping a pass, so where was VAR on that one?”Brendan Large tweets: “Alright Will, just wondering if you have any idea how Potter was thinking this team would score goals? Literally one attacker on the pitch and no go forward attitude. Hall has been Chelsea’s best player by a stretch I’d say.”It’s a fair question, Brendan, with Broja looking isolated for much of the first half. Mount has had his moments, but there’s no getting past the fact that Chelsea have had one shot. Liquid football, it is not.Julian Menz writes in with some queries: “Can you tell us more about how Chelsea are set up? Is Hall playing wing-back, was Loftus-Cheek playing wing-back? Is Azpilicueta now playing wing-back since Silva’s introduction?”In answer to your first question, Julian: yes, and apologies for not having done so already. Potter has set up his side in a 3-4-2-1 formation, with Hall and Loftus-Cheek starting at left and right wing-back respectively. Since Loftus-Cheek was forced off, Silva has dropped into the back three and César Azpilicueta has been shunted over to the right flank. Chelsea’s midfield pairing of Jorginho and Kovacic are struggling for control and there’s been very little play through the middle, with the visitors’ only shot of the half coming from a cross – from Hall – out on the left.Neither side have been at their best, but Newcastle have looked more likely to make a breakthrough. Chelsea’s attack has been utterly leaden for long stretches, even if their defence has largely held up well under pressure.Elsewhere …45+1 min The home fans roar for a penalty after Burn gets a low cross in which brushes Trevoh Chalobah’s arm. Robert Jones, the referee, waves away their appeals.44 min Joelinton cuts inside off the left flank in search of an opening, but he’s crowded out.We’ve had some email correspondence. “Great game,” says Richie Bradford. It’s hard to tell, but that could well be sarcasm.42 min Over the last 10 minutes, Newcastle have had 72% possession. They are making a strong end to the first half. 41 min Mendy collects the corner gratefully. Neither side has made much of their set pieces so far.40 min Almirón dribbles past three men in midfield to spark an attack which ends with Burn having a crack, which is deflected wide. Another corner to Newcastle.38 min The corner falls for Willock on the edge of the box, but he can’t force a shot through the seething mass of blue shirts.37 min Tripper plays in Longstaff out wide on the right. He gets a probing cross into the box, which Silva clears at the cost of a corner."
5,Premier League season so far: best signing to biggest disappointment,The Guardian,Will Unwin,2022-11-14T11:40:39Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/14/premier-league-season-so-far-best-signing-biggest-disappointment,"As England’s top flight halts for the World Cup we review the campaign and pick a best XI from across all 20 clubs We can sit here and overanalyse these matters to find a clever answer but sometimes the simplest is the best. Step forward Erling Haaland. Since arriving in the Premier League the Norwegian striker-bot’s record of 18 goals in 13 appearances – that’s one every 58 minutes he’s on the pitch – is frankly absurd. His movement and finishing are like nothing football has seen, leaving defenders rightly confused regarding how to stop him. Those at the World Cup will be pleased they will not have to face him because Norway did not qualify. On the other hand, it will mean he is rested for the second half of the season.Wolves have struggled to score, which is unsurprising considering the number of strikers they have on the sidelines. Raúl Jiménez has not played since August and Pedro Neto was injured at the start of October. The summer signing Sasa Kalajdzic arrived for £15m from Stuttgart, making his debut in a 1-0 win over Southampton, but had to be withdrawn at half-time with cruciate ligament damage that required surgery and it is not clear when he will return. Bruno Lage was forced into the free agent market to find some goals. Diego Costa was brought in, making his debut on 2 October against West Ham; Lage was sacked the next day. Costa is yet to score but he has been sent off.At time of writing, six Premier League clubs have changed manager but Scott Parker scoops this award. After battling to get Bournemouth into the Premier League, he lasted four games. Things started brightly thanks to a 2-0 win over Aston Villa, who have since sacked Steve Gerrard. Then reality hit and 16 goals were conceded in three games, culminating in a 9-0 loss at Anfield and a P45 in the post. He had spent his time between defeats bemoaning that Bournemouth were “way short of where we need to be” and “barely had any defenders”, two thinly veiled criticisms of the club’s transfer business. Gary O’Neil took over and went six games unbeaten to prove that Bournemouth were not too far short after all.Wolves 0-4 Leicester. Wolves had 21 shots and failed to score. They did not even test Danny Ward. On the other hand, Leicester scored with their first four efforts. Home fans sang about how bad the team were and turned their ire on members of the hierarchy. It was a reminder of their distinct lack of attacking threat and how they will spend the season battling relegation. Few stayed for the end and those who did were intent only on pointing out their disgust.Liverpool have underwhelmed in league proceedings. There have been far too many draws, plus losses to struggling Nottingham Forest and Leeds. Jürgen Klopp has spoken of his optimism that a better Liverpool will come out of the other side of the World Cup. From back to front there have been issues with form and fitness, causing many a head-scratching moment for the manager. After defeat at the City Ground, Klopp said he was “as low as possible” but things got worse when Crysencio Summerville popped up with a late winner at Anfield the following week. Klopp is not particularly excited by the World Cup, allowing him time to focus on how he can move Liverpool up the league.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballArsenal are top, which seems the easiest way to judge these things. Few would have predicted such an outcome but clever transfer business that brought Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko to the club has been the catalyst for success after careful building in recent years by Mikel Arteta. A loss at Manchester United and draw against Southampton are the only blemishes on their Premier League record in 14 matches. They look more resilient than the Gunners of previous seasons and are genuine title contenders for the first time in more than a decade. Now they need to show they can last the pace with Manchester City snapping at their heels.From relative ineptitude on the pitch to refusing to even go on, Cristiano Ronaldo’s efforts for Manchester United have been pretty pathetic. But do not worry CR7 fans, it’s not his fault because the club have “betrayed” him, he has no respect for Erik ten Hag and nothing has changed at Old Trafford since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013. That is why he has scored once in the league. He returned to Manchester as a legend but he will almost certainly depart in January having tainted his legacy for the sake of very little, except a fragile ego and ludicrous sense of self-importance"
6,Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action,The Guardian,Guardian sport,2022-11-14T08:00:33Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/14/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action,"Harvey Barnes and Joe Willock show they have England futures and Darwin Núñez is finding his feet at LiverpoolFor Pep Guardiola the World Cup may have arrived at an apposite moment. Manchester City could have beaten Brentford at the weekend but they lost, something they narrowly avoided when finding a way to beat Brighton, Leicester and Fulham in their previous Premier League outings. A six-week break for Qatar allows the manager to examine the team forensically and understand what is required to refresh a mode of play that is lacking the usual relentless pass-and-move sequences. “People go to their national team, they will be focused, it is a dream for them, it’s a World Cup. [The staff] have time to reflect: what we are doing well, what we could do better. After the first [league] game back – we will see,” said Guardiola. “The Premier League is difficult but we are going to try to come back good and fight for that.” Jamie JacksonMatch report: Man City 1-2 BrentfordThree vital points for Manchester United were won in thrillingly unconvincing fashion, with a starting XI that looked promising on paper providing as many questions as answers. An ostensibly riveting front three of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Elanga and Anthony Martial amounted to notably less than the sum of its parts, while a high-pedigree midfield trio was kept at arm’s length by the superb João Palhinha. United’s win was secured by a fearless young talent but over the course of the game it was less glamorous senior figures who gave United a platform for the win. Luke Shaw put in an industrious shift from left-back, covering the flank on his own and sparking numerous attacks with assured passing and clipped early crosses. Next to him, Victor Lindelöf stood firm when the visitors were firmly under the cosh at 1-1, repelling balls in the air and on the ground with zero margin for error. Much has been made of the need for a mass-clearout at Old Trafford – but not all the unfashionable old guard need to face the purge. Alex HessMatch report: Fulham 1-2 Manchester UnitedIf Joe Willock keeps playing like this, Gareth Southgate – or his successor – will surely offer the Newcastle midfielder a senior international cap. Willock not only scored a sublime winner against Chelsea on Saturday evening but thoroughly eclipsed the Qatar-bound Mason Mount and Conor Gallagher, dominating his first-half duel with the latter before Gallagher’s relocation to right wing-back. As Eddie Howe’s side registered a sixth straight victory, Chelsea lost a third successive Premier League game for the first time since José Mourinho’s tenure seven years ago. While the Londoners looked enervated, Newcastle proved a study in streetwise efficiency, keeping a fourth clean sheet in six league games. That has much to do with not only Nick Pope’s exceptional goalkeeping but Sven Botman’s excellence at centre-half, Dan Burn’s intelligent interpretation of an unfamiliar left-back role and Howe’s exceptional coaching. Louise TaylorMatch report: Newcastle 1-0 ChelseaThere was a moment in second-half stoppage time at Molineux on Saturday when, with the game long won and Wolves in a harmless position, three Arsenal players set about harrying Nathan Collins from different directions. On the sidelines, Mikel Arteta encouraged the press, and not for the first time. It was a snapshot of a team in a really good place. Arteta has said he will use the World Cup break to reflect on the strides his side have made but the togetherness in the table-topping squad seems priceless. “I think everyone can see the spirit of the team and the way we love each other,” Gabriel Jesus said. “The way we want to help each other on the pitch. That is what happens when you are in another family. We spend more time here [with Arsenal] than home. That is why it is working outside.” Ben FisherMatch report: Wolves 0-2 ArsenalIt has been an awkward start for Darwin Núñez and Liverpool to say the least but as he signed off with a brace, a rampant display and a standing ovation against Southampton, the Uruguay international offered further evidence of why Jürgen Klopp expects his team to be more like their former selves after the World Cup. The 23-year-old, signed for an initial £64m in the summer from Benfica, now has an impressive nine goals in 18 appearances for his new club. His understanding with Andy Robertson down the left and awareness of what those around him expect, encapsulated by a delightful backheel to set up Roberto Firmino following a superb move, also demonstrated how things are falling into place for Núñez at Liverpool. “He has all the qualities for a modern-day striker,” said Virgil van Dijk. “There is a reason why we bought him and he’s maturing, he’s stayed patient, kept his head down, and that’s a credit to him. It is a new team, new environment, new country, new language so it is absolutely normal to take a little bit more time but there is no doubt the qualities are there and the goals will follow.” Andy HunterMatch report: Liverpool 3-1 SouthamptonDejan Kulusevski is not a flashy player but that does not matter one bit. He is devastatingly effective and if Tottenham had not been deprived of him since mid-September perhaps they would be putting more pressure on second-placed Manchester City, if not Arsenal. The Swedish forward is strong, quick, crisp, full of energy, carries the ball dynamically and makes exceptional decisions: it is some package for a 22-year-old and it says plenty that, in such a broken-up season, his clever assist for Rodrigo Bentancur’s winner against Leeds was his fifth of the campaign. He was on song from the start against Jesse Marsch’s team and seemed to get even stronger as the game continued; angst over the availability of Son Heung-min and Harry Kane is nothing new at Spurs but there is a strong argument that Kulusevski should not be considered any less important. Nick AmesMatch report: Tottenham 4-3 Leeds UtdSign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballIt’s not easy to come up with reasons as to why Frank Lampard should remain manager of Everton … but then it wasn’t easy to come up with reasons as to why Lampard should have been appointed as manager of Everton. So perhaps the board, who decided he was the man for the job then allowed him to splurge not far off £100m in transfer fees – never mind wages – will stick with him. They may rationalise that he kept them up last season, but the reality is that he took over in January so was partially responsible for their surprise presence in a relegation battle, and the wild atmosphere in which the players saved themselves was created by the club’s support. Lampard can claim as a triumph the central-midfield redeployment of Alex Iwobi – probably the least dreadful Everton player at Bournemouth. But it is far from enough, and there is zero evidence to suggest Lampard has the chops to tidy his mess. Daniel HarrisMatch report: Bournemouth 3-0 EvertonThe attention was inevitably on James Maddison, who gave England a brief injury scare when he hobbled off at the London Stadium, but he was not the only bright young attacker who caught the eye during Leicester’s win over West Ham. Harvey Barnes had a big part to play in Maddison’s early goal, running away from Thilo Kehrer before combining with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Patson Daka, and he finished West Ham by scoring his side’s second with 12 minutes left. It was a clinical finish from Barnes, who has four goals in his last six games. He appears to be over his injury problems. Tricky, speedy and direct, Barnes is looking sharp. He is not going to the World Cup, but his current form is a reminder of why Gareth Southgate had him in the England squad two years ago. If he keeps it up Barnes could yet be playing alongside Maddison for England. Jacob SteinbergMatch report: West Ham 0-2 LeicesterSix points (albeit alongside a disappointing cup exit) in his opening fortnight suggest Unai Emery’s initial impressions of his Aston Villa squad have been spot on. And while Sunday’s victory at Brighton was very different to their win against Manchester United seven days prior, Emery’s game management was equally impressive. Five second-half changes at the Amex were all designed to frustrate Brighton and allow his side to absorb pressure. Emery has used all 15 of the substitutions available to him so far. Whereas his predecessor hesitated to make alterations, the Spaniard has done so swiftly. Emery will now use the break to study his squad’s strengths. He probably ought not say it aloud, but the fact that so few are heading to Qatar may just be a blessing. Sam DallingMatch report: Brighton 1-2 Aston VillaYou probably won’t be aware of this, but last summer Nottingham Forest made 22 signings! I know! For a while, it looked like Steve Cooper was lost in the larder, unsure of who to use or when to use them. After the dispiriting defeat to Wolves, Forest were bottom of the table with five points from 10 games, but they drew two and won two of their next five, then in midweek they comprehensively ejected Spurs from the League Cup. If you add that many to your squad, the law of averages says that some of them have to be good, and for Forest it looks like Morgan Gibbs-White and Jesse Lingard might be the difference-makers. There’s plenty of work still to be done, but there’s nothing more important in football than the ability to score. Lingard, whose commitment was being questioned only recently, certainly has that, while Gibbs-White just might be in the process of adding the numbers that elevate him from talent into player.

7,Fan-led review of football governance still waiting for liftoff after 12 months | Paul MacInnes,The Guardian,Paul MacInnes,2022-11-15T18:22:37Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/15/fan-led-review-of-football-governance-still-waiting-for-liftoff-after-12-months,"The government says it accepts the review’s central recommendation, which is the creation of an independent regulator for footballIn committee room 3a of the House of Lords on Tuesday, a gathering was held to commemorate the first anniversary of the fan-led review of football governance. It was a stuffy affair, in the sense that someone should probably have opened a window, and an airless room may have contributed to a mood which stopped some way short of celebratory.Twelve months after Tracey Crouch launched the review to wide acclaim, its status remains in limbo. A document the Football Supporters’ Association had said offered an “unprecedented opportunity” to reform the game and which the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, called “comprehensive, wide-ranging, bold and radical” is still waiting to get off the launch pad.The reasons why are numerous and to most people in the committee room – almost all over the age of 45 – wearily familiar. Much of it is politics, and firstly the politics of Westminster, where the Conservative government has yet to match deeds to supportive words. The government says it accepts the review’s central recommendation, which is the creation of an independent regulator for football. However it has yet to publish a white paper that would spell out how such a regulator might work in law. It was due in the summer, and then in the autumn, and now – despite assurances to the room from the sports minister, Stuart Andrew – there remains no date for its arrival.The process has not been helped by the fall of two prime ministers in as many months. The commitment to the review appeared to disappear altogether under the brief administration of Liz Truss. Andrew has calmed a lot of nerves since his appointment last month, but the language – that of civil servants “working at pace” – remains the same as nine months ago.It’s time for the government to deliver, yet appearances suggest Crouch is relatively relaxed about the delay. She says she believes there will be a regulator within five years whatever happens and makes a point of noting the review has cross-party support; code for “if this government doesn’t get on with it, a Labour government will surely do so instead”. The political struggle proving a bigger impediment to change, it turns out, appears to be the one within football itself.In her foreword to an FSA publication looking at the review a year on, Crouch mentions the Premier League just once, and that’s to acknowledge Manchester City as champions. While the Football Association “should be applauded: for recent internal reforms and the EFL’s new financial control bodies are acknowledged”, no action or achievement from the game’s biggest power broker is even mentioned. In the room, Crouch apologised for beating up on the Premier League, but didn’t deny she was doing it.The heart of the problem is that the Premier League is yet to hold talks with the English Football League over financial redistribution, despite it being one of the review’s original recommendations. “Whilst the EFL has long had a clear position,” the FSA publication notes, “the Premier League has still not engaged in a discussion.”The nature of this standoff is straightforward but symbolic of differences between the Premier League and EFL which ultimately run deep. The EFL says that, as part of a restructuring of the game, it wants 25% of the Premier League’s broadcast revenues to support the pyramid upon which English football depends. The Premier League says it wants guarantees before it commits to any increase (it shares 16% of TV money, though most is in parachute payments). Specifically it wants to know any money does not simply end up doing what it often has in the past; fuelling wage inflation as clubs chase a place in the most successful domestic league in the world.It’s not just the policies that are rubbing each other up; there’s status at play, too. The Premier League bristles at being expected to talk when the lower leagues have set preconditions. The EFL feels there has been little to no constructive engagement from the top flight. Both sides know the threats implicit in the review – that if the leagues don’t strike a deal themselves, the regulator will write one for them – are unlikely to come to pass in the short term.For those who have been around long enough this all has a ring of familiarity; a bright new dawn that sinks away into dusk without anything having changed. The response to dismay, however, is that such an interpretation is not quite correct. Even the Premier League now accepts the idea of independent regulation. This was not the case a year ago.The FA, through the appointment of a new chair and non-executive directors, has gone a long way to showing it understands the challenges facing governance within the game. Meanwhile, the FSA has been building bridges both domestically and across the continent, meaning that many fans now have better representation at their clubs than any time in living memory, with Liverpool and Manchester United – two Super League conspirators – among those leading the way.Suspicion and mistrust at the top of the English game remain and it feels like, without external pressure, discussions may not get to the point where a new deal for football can be struck. At the same time the Premier League has finally signed off a counter offer to the EFL and perhaps it’s the order in which events might happen that could be key.“Regulation before redistribution” is the new catchphrase, a sequence which would suit the Premier League and an idea Crouch can get behind. After giving the Premier League the stick this week, she offered those in the committee room an olive branch. If the Premier League was to increase redistribution it “should not be giving money to bad owners”, she said. “It would be like opening the windows and keeping the heating on.”"

9,Premier League clubs face mixed risks of sending players to the World Cup,The Guardian,John Brewin,2022-11-15T14:49:12Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/15/premier-league-clubs-face-mixed-risks-of-sending-players-to-the-world-cup,"Manchester City have 16 players in Qatar but for teams with fewer representatives, this winter offers vital rebuilding timePep Guardiola was notably accepting of Manchester City’s defeat by Brentford in their last match before the World Cup. “My staff and I will have time to reflect on what we did well and what to do better,” he shrugged. Guardiola and his staff may also have to watch events in Qatar through their hands, clenching as heavy tackles fly in and muscle injuries stack up given City – with 16 players – are the Premier League club sending the most players to the finals.Even if Erling Haaland will be spending much of the next six weeks on the Etihad Campus, key players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden and Rodri will return bearing the physical and mental scars of the tournament. And individual success in Qatar may not necessarily be good news for a player’s club. To take the example of England’s Euro 2020 finalists, a number of Gareth Southgate’s players made indifferent starts to their 2021-22 club campaigns.Such are the intangibles for clubs of this World Cup. Jürgen Klopp is a vocal critic of the tournament being staged in Qatar, particularly in mid‑season, but he will see only seven players jet out to pre-tournament training camps. Like Guardiola, Klopp has a star forward getting a needed rest, in Mohamed Salah, but it is Uruguay rather than Liverpool who will be the immediate beneficiaries of Darwin Núñez’s recent flowering.Overall the Premier League is providing more World Cup players than any other division, with 134 players at the tournament – 16% – plying their trade in the English top flight. The league leaders, Arsenal, have 10 players in World Cup squads but their England contingent of three contains two players, Aaron Ramsdale and Ben White, expected to be reserves in Southgate’s squad. The same may go for Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli among a Brazil squad featuring heavy competition for forward places. Mikel Arteta appears to be getting off rather lightly, though how to motivate players disappointed at being underused is yet another consideration to add to the pile.The response of players to disappointing tournaments is also important. How, for example, might Antonio Conte coax the best from Harry Kane at Tottenham should England’s captain flop in Qatar? Or, to name another player among Spurs’ 11 call-ups, someone carrying a yet heavier burden for his national team, Son Heung‑min? Will his disappointing season so far – and the facial injury he is nursing – cast a shadow over his World Cup and consequently his return to Tottenham? Every player is on a sliding scale. How might they react to playing in a mid‑season tournament in which their country’s expectations are sky‑high while playing for a different coach using probably very different tactics?For managers such as Graham Potter and Erik ten Hag, relative newcomers to their clubs trying to install a fresh playing doctrine, losing players in mid‑season is unhelpful. Manchester United, sending 14, have made significant improvements under Ten Hag, and though Cristiano Ronaldo can be discounted from the list of players whose fitness he will care about, Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martínez have all been crucial to United’s revival. Each is playing for a nation expected to go deep in the tournament.Potter’s Chelsea have stalled of late. His players have appeared unresponsive to his tactics. Chelsea will have 12 players in Qatar but a mid‑season training camp planned for Abu Dhabi also gives Potter a decent core with which to work. Reece James, Wesley Fofana, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Marc Cucurella, Trevoh Chalobah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Jorginho and Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang are among those players not travelling.This is a World Cup like no other.

Should Bournemouth appoint a new manager – or Gary O’Neil stay on – only the Wales pair of Kieffer Moore and Chris Mepham will not be around.Three managers ended the season’s first tranche of fixtures under pressure. At West Ham David Moyes will have mixed feelings if England progress deep in the tournament, with Declan Rice a key midfielder. Lucas Paquetá, the summer’s big signing, is yet to shine in east London but is favoured by the Brazil coach, Tite. Perhaps a good showing in Qatar can energise Paquetá’s club season. Jesse Marsch will be roaring on Team USA, though in Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams he will fear fatigue in two players who have become important to Leeds.Which leaves Frank Lampard, with Everton losing four players to the tournament. Until his mistakes at Bournemouth at the weekend, Jordan Pickford had been exemplary in goal. An injury or the loss of form that can follow for players scapegoated for English failure could mortally wound Everton. Such are the myriad equations the World Cup must turn over in the minds of Premier League managers."
10,Iliman Ndiaye’s rise from Sunday league to Senegal World Cup ace,The Guardian,Will Unwin,2022-12-03T07:30:38Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/03/iliman-ndiayes-rise-from-sunday-league-to-senegal-world-cup-ace,"Sheffield United’s rising star is preparing to face England in Qatar after a formative spell in the Northern Premier LeagueIliman Ndiaye wanted to perfect his skills so much they had to turn off the lights at Hyde United’s Ewen Fields to make sure he got the last train home. Being sent on loan from the Premier League to the seventh tier may not seem like the most attractive proposition for a teenager but the Sheffield United forward embraced his spell in the Northern Premier League.Ndiaye, 22, who will face England with Senegal in the World Cup on Sunday, had been playing Sunday league football in the months before Sheffield United took him on a week’s trial in 2019 after he was spotted by the scout Steve Holmes. Ndiaye played in two trial matches and impressed the coaches with his fitness, aggression and skill. They offered a contract but he almost did not join because Marseille, where he had spent time in the academy as a young boy, were due compensation. Holmes and the coach Travis Binnion convinced United to pay up.From the pittance the club paid, Ndiaye is now worth millions. Nottingham Forest were keen on him in the summer before they acquired Jesse Lingard. His path to the Premier League started during his short spell with Hyde in 2020 after their then manager, David McGurk, and his assistant John McCombe spotted him playing for Sheffield United Under-23s.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws.

Support our investigative journalism today.At Hyde, he travelled from Sheffield for training twice a week and would amaze teammates with his dazzling footwork and ability to balance the ball on his head for a minute. Ndiaye’s work ethic also stood out.His father would do daily sessions with a young Ndiaye, often in the woods, where he acquired his industrious attitude. The respect of teammates was quickly earned; seeing how pivotal he was to their chances, players would go out of their way to ensure he got home safely.“There were games where he was so far ahead of everyone,” McGurk says. “It got to the point with us where we said: ‘Wherever you are on the pitch, give him the ball. No matter how tightly marked he is, give him the ball.’ We just wanted him on the ball as much as possible. He would start on the left but we gave him the freedom to do what he wanted.“It can be a detriment to the squad if you are focusing on one player but the lads just appreciated it and they were happy to give him the ball. I have never seen a player that good at this level. I would turn up on a Saturday excited to watch the team as a manager because he was in it.”A family visit to Senegal when the France-born Ndiaye was a one-year-old started his obsession with football. He would kick anything in sight, forcing his grandad to take action and acquire a ball for him. Since then it has barely left his feet. In France he would play in cages, learning how to deceive opponents. Scouts took notice and he was signed by Marseille.The family chose to move to Senegal for a period, forcing Ndiaye to leave his Marseille dreams behind. He joined Dakar Sacré-Cœur and went from honing his skills at one of Europe’s elite clubs to practising on sand pitches and at the beach, ensuring his ball control was impeccable. Ndiaye’s father then found work in England, resulting in a move to London aged 14. The teenager arrived unable to speak English, so his dad sent him to football camps where he could express himself. Eight years on, Ndiaye speaks with a north London twang.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballHe would combine studying with playing for Boreham Wood’s youth teams, eventually making it on to their first-team bench on a couple of occasions without making a National League appearance.To maintain fitness, he played Sunday league games for Rising Ballers in London before being snapped up by Sheffield United.When Ndiaye arrived at Bramall Lane they thought his understanding of the game needed working on but he had a real will to learn. Hyde were a key part of that education. “He is destined for the top,” McGurk says. “We told him that after one of the games.“We said: ‘You’ve got absolutely everything – you are not going to be playing at this level again after you go back to Sheffield United.’ I am surprised by how rapidly it has happened but he has got everything to play at the top level.”The following season he was given his Premier League debut – at Leicester – and just over a year later he represented Senegal.“We’ve played a very small part but you do take pride in giving the kid an opportunity with the move to Hyde,” McGurk says. “Sheffield United v Burnley was on the TV, and you watch with a sense of pride because he is doing exactly the same thing to Burnley defenders that he was doing to defenders in our league.”England will take comfort in the one blot on Ndiaye’s brief Hyde career: a skied penalty in a Cheshire Senior Cup match against Vauxhall Motors. He has certainly come a long way in a short time since."

It makes more sense than him playing golf for six weeks.“We think he will be a great fit for us and would slot in with our squad dynamic really well.”Ashton, who are based six miles from City’s Etihad Stadium, are 11th in their division and were beaten 2-0 in front of a crowd of 622 at Gainsborough n Saturday.Haaland has scored 23 goals in 18 appearances for Premier League champions City since his £51m summer move from Borussia Dortmund.Pep Guardiola said last week Haaland would be allowed some time off – which he expected him to split between a holiday in Marbella and a visit home to Norway – before returning to training in early December.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballWhether or not the 22-year-old is tempted by Ashton’s unlikely offer the article on the club’s website said: “The club are yet to receive any response from Manchester City.”"

13,Thomas Hitzlsperger: ‘You can’t be paid by Qatar or Fifa and criticise them’,The Guardian,Sid Lowe,2022-11-16T23:00:32Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/16/thomas-hitzlsperger-you-cant-be-paid-by-qatar-or-fifa-and-criticise-them,"The first Premier League player to come out speaks on migrant worker abuses in Qatar and money’s malign influence on the game“I asked myself the question and my answer was that they can’t kill my passion: I still love football,” Thomas Hitzlsperger says, but he knows they have tried. It is nine years since he became the first Premier League footballer to reveal he is gay, a decision that improved his life and those of others too. “Even today,” he says, “someone came up to me and said: ‘Are you who I think you are?’ I said: ‘Probably.’ He put his thumbs up, said: ‘Good on you.’“And that’s so powerful, which is why I say to others: it’s not just your personal situation, which is of course the most important thing. And that’s why I don’t stop speaking up. Now when I reflect, my decision was all about what impact I can have on society, without overdoing it.“You’d be surprised how many people you can reach,” the former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton midfielder says, reflecting on the role of LGBTQ supporters’ groups, the increase in symbolism, a shift in attitudes at clubs embracing the gay community. He discusses how more athletes have stood up, how he “would love to see a big, active player come out”, and how there has been a “big, big change”. He says: “The environment is constantly improving in football, at least in most parts.”And then on Sunday, the World Cup kicks off in a country where being gay is illegal. Only last week Khalid Salman, an ambassador for the competition, described homosexuality as a “mental defect”. Football enabled this, politicians and sports people have justified or normalised it. David Beckham has been paid to promote Qatar.“It’s just wrong,” Hitzlsperger says, and nor is the “sickening” situation for homosexuals in Qatar the only aspect that concerns him. Indeed his discussion now, and the focus of a documentary he has just filmed in Qatar and Nepal, begins instead with the widow describing her husband coming home in a coffin, the workers he met who go unpaid. Those are the stories that have left him wondering where the line is. Not just their line – that, he thinks, is all too clear – but his own.The former player – who represented Germany 52 times, played in a World Cup and a European Championship and won the Bundesliga with VfB Stuttgart – has grappled with how he should engage with a tournament he will be watching from a studio in Mainz for German television.Even doing that meant examining his conscience; while others, such as Gary Neville with beIN Sports, have chosen to go to the Gulf state, Hitzlsperger says: “If I had the option, I wouldn’t: it just doesn’t feel right after what I have seen, the things I have said in public. You can’t be paid by Qatar or Fifa and at the same time criticise them, it doesn’t make sense.“You see the world we live in: how sick it is that we allowed Qatar to buy the right to send pictures to the world for four weeks, presenting themselves as something they’re not. It’s not just sad, it’s sick.“A Nepali worker told me he saw people collapse in the heat, so they’re put in a room to cool down for an hour, then you have to work again. The paperwork says: ‘Died in his sleep.’ That’s not the reason. The government says the Kafala system doesn’t exist but it still does, in practice. There are so many things you think: this must not happen. But it does. And to me Fifa allowed it to happen.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.“I spoke to a woman from Human Rights Watch who said Qatari officials have figures but don’t publish them. I met a young woman there who tried to show me how open it was and when worker deaths came up, she said the criticism was not justified. She even used the phrase ‘fake news’. She doesn’t get to see it: she thinks the west is against Qatar. So it’s difficult to judge how many deaths there have been, but it’s not three.”Three is the number the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, claimed.“People criticise Qatar, but we have to discuss Fifa’s role, those from the former executive committee who took the money,” Hitzlsperger says. “Because if no one would take it, if no one received it, Qatar would have a problem. But the greed in the football business is just immense.”Fifa has since acknowledged these wrongdoings and the need for reform, in the 2017 Garcia report.“There is so much money involved and some people have no morals and just take it. You find a PR agency, you pay them, and they give you a reason. I spoke to Fifa’s media department. They’re incredibly nice, kind people but they make you believe they’re trying everything to get the conversation going and it never happens, so they are smart. It would have been easy for Infantino to explain the improvements, the changes, to say why it makes sense to give Qatar the World Cup. He’s smart enough, but he refuses to speak: why? Why aren’t you more transparent?”Instead, Infantino sent a letter to the 32 national federations telling them to focus purely on the football now. “That shows how fed up they are,” Hitzlsperger says. The Qatari organisers are too, some suggesting that racism lies beneath criticism.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“That’s totally understandable,” Hitzlsperger says. “Put ourselves in their shoes: there’s a point where you say: ‘Look, we’ve had enough, we’ve changed.’ And there has been change, probably more than in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. We have to mention in their defence that they’ve spent four years with the blockade as well. There’s probably fear. Hosting a tournament is a way of protecting themselves – as is investing in football clubs. I understand that.“But the price is that it costs lives. And if you bring race into it: prove it, name the people who are racist. We have to understand that they know they can buy whatever they want: you offer people money, they take it. But suddenly there are people saying: ‘We don’t want your money.’”The question is what can be done now? Hitzlsperger understands that more was not said or done sooner when real change may have been possible – “that’s just human nature and I’m not going to blame journalists as it wasn’t on the agenda: why would you talk about Qatar five years ago?” – and he has doubts about the efficacy of statements such as the One Love rainbow armband to be worn by 10 captains.“The original idea was to get together among the European federations and come up with the best idea,” he says, “but the end product is an armband that possibly means a lot but doesn’t upset anybody. It becomes generic, people go: ‘What does it mean?’ Then they move on. It doesn’t start a debate. We know the rainbow flag symbol upsets people. People know what it stands for – and some in Qatar don’t like it so much. That’s stronger.”There are broader conclusions. “The question has been why don’t teams boycott the tournament? They can’t even agree on an armband,” Hitzlsperger says. Besides, this goes beyond sport. “Not long ago the German FA president and the interior minister said they had been reassured by the Qatari interior minister that everybody would be safe. And you think: what world are we living in?! That someone has to give a guarantee!”And the message may also be lost in the noise. “When it’s every day even people who agree think: ‘I can’t hear this any more,’” Hitzlsperger concedes. “I’m trying to find a balance between saying it, refusing to be quiet, and not saying it every day. It’s a shame: it destroys part of the game.”Ah, the game. Hitzlsperger talks eloquently about it. He discusses the evolution in the German side since 2008, laughing about how they needed to get rid of him first and recalling a European Championship final where he could not get near Spain. He talks of Jamal Musiala, a player he can’t quite stop himself momentarily likening to Lionel Messi, concluding: “He said he wants to become one of the best in the world: I’d put money on that.”And there’s a fondness for the England manager he first met at 18, recalling Gareth Southgate as a player “who stood out, smarter”, “a kind man”, a “modern leader”.Yet that’s the point: for now at least, the game is lost, used and abused, taken from those for whom it is everything. Hitzlsperger is trying to resist, unwilling to let go. “I still love football but people come into it who don’t know what it means to fans, to players.“Everything changes, money dictates everything. I don’t know at what point I will give up, go and watch Sunday league. But I still love it. It’s tiring: everything that has happened makes you not want to watch, but they haven’t managed to kill my passion for the game.”"

NBC’s deal for both the English- and Spanish-language media rights to all 380 Premier League fixtures – for a then-bargain fee of $250m over three years that has since been renewed for $2.7bn over the next six – established soccer in the American sports firmament like never before by making matches available on both free-to-air television and NBC’s family of cable networks.“Growing up, the Premier League was always the dream,” Adams said on Thursday. “I grew up a huge Thierry Henry fan, partially because he played for New York Red Bulls, but also because I watched a lot of Arsenal games as well. I admired him, how he played the game. I think in America, you see a lot of young players tuning into a lot of the Premier League games.

Support our investigative journalism today.When the United States meet England in a blockbuster group-stage tie on Friday night at the Al Bayt Stadium, they will effectively be facing one of the reasons for the sport’s rising profile back home. For the 23-year-old Adams, the wider accessibility of the Premier League only further cultivated a dream that was planted when he joined New York Red Bulls during Henry’s four-year stint in Major League Soccer.Having forged a reputation as an industrious ball-winning defensive midfielder, Adams moved to NYRB’s sister club RB Leipzig in 2019, making his biggest splash when he fired in the goal that lifted the Bundesliga club into the Champions League semi-finals. When he landed at Leeds United in a $24.2m (£20m) transfer this summer, it fulfilled a lifelong dream that not even his success in Germany could match.“The Bundesliga wasn’t the biggest thing for me when I was growing up,” he said. “You saw a lot of quality players on the pitch at the same time [in the Premier League], no matter which teams were playing.“I remember telling my mom at a young age that I wanted to play in England. The culture is not too far off of what America has to offer, so definitely that transition has been a lot easier than playing in Germany. But there’s something special about the Premier League. There always has been and I think there always will be.”USA coach Gregg Berhalter, who on Monday became the first person to play for and manage an American side at a World Cup, came of age at a time when finding Premier League matches on American television was all but impossible. Only when he was in the Netherlands during the 1990s at the outset of a 15-year playing career in Europe was he exposed to the Premier League on a regular basis.“I remember when I was in Holland getting home from my games on Saturday watching Match of the Day on BBC, and that was the only real highlights you got,” Berhalter said. “And now, every Saturday morning in America, waking up to watching the Premier League and seeing all the fan festivals they’re having. Everyone now in America seems to have a team that they support.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“It’s an incredible league. We’re really proud to have our players playing in that league. And to me, it’s similar to the NFL and in terms of how dominant it is and how commercial-orientated it is.”Adams, who is the youngest captain of the 32 squads in Qatar by some distance, is also the youngest player to wear the skipper’s armband for a US team at the World Cup since Walter Bahr in 1950 – a tournament where the Americans famously bucked the odds with a 1-0 upset of England in Belo Horizonte.As the United States have rebuilt from the wreckage of their catastrophic failure to qualify for the World Cup four years ago, Adams has made no secret of this group’s goal of changing the way the world perceives American soccer. An inspired performance in Friday’s match on the northeast coast of Qatar could go a long way to making it happen.“It’s a obviously a huge opportunity to fast-track the impact that we can have,” Adams said. “These are the games where the pressure is a privilege to step on the field against some of these guys. We respect them. There’s probably a mutual respect between both teams. And when you get a result in a game like this, people start to respect Americans a little bit more.”"

21,Jason Lee: ‘David Baddiel’s apology was overdue. I’ve waited a long time’,The Guardian,Will Unwin,2022-11-21T10:00:52Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/21/jason-lee-interview-david-baddiel-apology,"Former Nottingham Forest striker was subjected to racist bullying on comedian’s Fantasy Football League TV show in the mid-90s“I am sorry, Jason.” Those are the words Jason Lee has waited 25 years to hear from David Baddiel, and finally they are being delivered – to his face. Before Lee has a chance to respond, Baddiel lists offences from belittling the striker to his racist portrayal of the former Nottingham Forest player on Fantasy Football League in the mid-90s.Without doubt Baddiel’s actions are sincere. He, among others, helped to define Lee’s career for the sake of laughter and little else. Few football fans can hear Lee’s name without the immediate response of “pineapple head”.“Long overdue,” Lee says of the apology. “I’ve had to wait a long time, I’ve always felt I was contactable and there was an opportunity. I thought it was a poor excuse to say he couldn’t get in touch with me. I think he admits embarrassment, shame and the longer it took, the harder it was to have that conversation.”The conversation takes place on Lee’s new AbsoluteLee podcast. “I didn’t build David Baddiel up to be anything other than a small man whose job it is to take the piss out of people,” Lee says. “For him to meet me physically would have been very difficult, not just emotionally. He came in and wanted to get it off his chest as soon as possible. I think that showed a bit of vulnerability from his side, it did not show confidence, it did not show strength in that situation.”The two were finally brought together because Baddiel has made a Channel 4 documentary, Jews Don’t Count, on antisemitism and felt the need to address the issue he has created through discriminatory behaviour. Everything clicked for Baddiel when Leigh Francis, aka Keith Lemon, performed what many have seen as an antisemitic impersonation on Bo’ Selecta!, putting Baddiel in Lee’s shoes. Baddiel has apologised publicly to Lee in the past in the media but never personally.“A lot of people do go through life not having an understanding until it actually impacts them or their family or friends,” Lee says. “You may have a gay friend or black friend and you do not understand because it hasn’t happened to you until you have witnessed it.”Fantasy Football League allowed Baddiel to do blackface as part of his Lee caricature, and the programme mocked his dreadlocks that he tied up during matches and did sketches where Lee would be unable to put something in the bin, for example, because of his perceived poor finishing. Lee was rightly proud of his dreadlocks but they were the key focus of Baddiel’s and Frank Skinner’s jibes. Skinner too has apologised via the media.Lee was at the peak of a career that took in all four divisions but what he achieved on the pitch has been overshadowed by two men and their jokes that made him a household name. They were the faces of the show but were backed by a BBC production team. Lee says no one from that team has apologised to him.“It is not my personality to accept being mocked face to face,” Lee says. “David Baddiel would never have got away with that in the same room. He only got away with that because he was on TV and he had the mic and quite a lot of control and a lot of people who backed him and enabled him to carry on in that way.”Fantasy Football League invited Lee on to the show, via Forest’s captain Stuart Pearce, but he did not want to endorse the racism it was airing. Few spoke out against the content.The apology and interview are not the end of the matter. It is a milestone but more needs to be done on discrimination, something Baddiel’s own projects and Lee’s work for the Professional Footballers’ Association in its equalities department will help to tackle.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“I think it was important to try and draw a line under it,” Lee says. “There is no point apologising and then going out and putting your foot in it and continuing to make grave errors. It is a process. You have to give people the opportunity to apologise and prove that they are sincere. The first part is the apology and now let’s see how you conduct yourself.”Lee is in his home office when we speak, surrounded by shirts from his career, including those of Nottingham Forest, Lincoln and Watford. Those of opponents hang on the wall from European nights against Bayern Munich, Lyon and Auxerre. In the Premier League for Forest, he scored in an away win at Leeds, two goals against Manchester City and earned a point at Chelsea in front of Baddiel.“I look back on my career with pride and joy. It took me a long time to hang my shirts up in my house. I don’t know if that was a conscious thing but there are some impressive shirts. They are little reminders to me that I wore that shirt and played at a really decent level. Before I was playing for Forest, there were no pineapple chants. It was only when I got really successful and I was playing in the Premier League that Baddiel and Skinner picked up on it.”Lee will go on to interview others for his podcast, although none will be as personal as his long-awaited encounter with Baddiel. “He didn’t ruin my life or career and I am always keen to push back on that when these people are trying to create that narrative,” he says. “I am not going to give that guy that much credit.”Absolute Lee: episode one with David Baddiel is available from 10pm on Monday"

Other locals have been seen chanting their support for Argentina and Brazil.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.In a statement the Supreme Committee said it rejected the allegations about fake fans, which they called “disappointing and unsurprising”.“Fans from all over the world – many of whom have made Qatar their home – have contributed to the local atmosphere recently, organising fan walks and parades throughout the country, and welcoming the various national teams at their hotels,” it said in a statement. “Numerous journalists and commentators on social media have questioned whether these are ‘real’ fans. We thoroughly reject these assertions, which are both disappointing and unsurprising.”Hundreds of England-supporting Indian fans shouted “It’s coming home” as well as “Southgate is our super coach! Sterling is our super star! Pickford is our super keeper!” as the England team arrived at their five-star hotel on Tuesday.One England supporter from Kerala who led the chants described suggestions that he and the others were receiving cash to be cheerleaders as “fake news”. “None of us is getting paid,” he said. “We are diehard England fans. My favourite player was Beckham, but now it is Saka. If someone offered to pay us to support England we would turn them down. We are genuine supporters. Many of us grew up watching Beckham and Michael Owen. Our love is to this team.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballThe Supreme Committee also said football fans celebrated differently based on where they were in the world. “Qatar, and the rest of the world, is comprised of a diverse range of football fans, many of whom share emotional connections with multiple nations,” it said. “In different places around the world, fans have different traditions, different ways to celebrate, and while that may contrast with what people are used to in Europe or South America, it doesn’t mean the passion for football is any less authentic. Journalists on the ground who speak to and meet these fans are realising the reality.”The tournament kicks off on Sunday, with Qatar facing Ecuador."
25,"The football club, the billionaire - and the bills: Everton’s race to build its new home",The Guardian,Simon Goodley,2022-11-13T15:36:16Z,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/13/everton-football-club-new-stadium-bramley-moore-dock,"Club’s bankers continue search for funds to complete £500m stadium after almost three years of tryingWhen Everton football club kicked off its latest project to build a new stadium, its owner, Farhad Moshiri, promised supporters he would do whatever it took to get it built.“I’ll throw as much money as needed,” the businessman told the club’s annual meeting in 2019. “It is no luxury, we have to get it done. If we want to have a big club we need a modern stadium and we will get it.”The £500m project represented the club’s latest effort to leave its famous, if creaking, Goodison Park home – where one of the original 12 founding members of the Football League first played in 1892.Previous attempts to move, dating back to the 1990s, had been aborted. But, as Moshiri addressed supporters and shareholders, Everton fans felt reassured, as they now had an owner whom the Sunday Times Rich List valued as a billionaire plus the backing of a city council promising a £280m loan to help fund the project. Many must have believed that their once glorious club, which last lifted a trophy by winning the FA Cup in 1995, was finally on the brink of a new dawn.Only now – with Moshiri reportedly in talks to sell a stake in the club and problems mounting at Goodison Park – some fans are debating if that new dawn may turn into a false one.The chosen new site at Bramley-Moore Dock – the northernmost point of the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City – was cited by Unesco as one reason for stripping the city’s historic trading zone of its world heritage site status in 2021.Then, an agreed £30m naming rights option for the new stadium with Moshiri’s long-term business partner, Alisher Usmanov, was cancelled – after the oligarch was sanctioned in March following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.But, perhaps most significant of all, Everton backed away from the 2018 local authority funding deal and, in May 2022, Everton agreed to pay £502,000 of the £841,000 in costs Liverpool city council expended in exploring the loan.The events surrounding that deal also drew official scrutiny from Liverpool city council commissioners, who were imposed by central government last year to oversee improvements at the local authority. They concluded that local officials had “incurred significant expenditure to investigate the possibility of a loan to EFC without any formal approval and without any budget provision approval”.All of this raises questions about the new 52,888-seat stadium and how this grand old football club is financed.Everton has been attempting to find financial backers to build its new stadium for years – eventually hiring the US investment bank JP Morgan and Japan’s largest bank, MUFG, to help raise the £500m required in January 2020.Despite those two financial institutions searching for funds, financial backing has still to be secured almost three years on – and Everton has chosen an unorthodox route to start construction.Experts told the Guardian that the usual method of financing new stadiums was to secure all the funds required before a shovel is thrust into the ground – even though clubs then typically refinance projects at a later date.Everton alighted on a different course: relying on Moshiri’s backing to start work before all the investment capital was raised – which the club argues should now allow it to access cheaper debt to complete the project, as it has been made less risky.Certainly the site presents unusual challenges that may warrant an unorthodox funding model, as few football grounds are constructed over water.Built in 1848, Bramley-Moore Dock was primarily used for coal – both for export and to supply it for steamships. The site was in use for 140 years, but as coal-fired steamships fell out of use, and then the coalmines in south Lancashire closed, demand disappeared, leading to its shuttering in 1988.Everton then “infilled” the dock with sand and compacted the upper six metres by dropping a nine-tonne weight at a frequency of 60 times a minute, in order to prepare the surface for the construction project.Despite those quirky surroundings and the resultant construction challenges, Everton is confident about its big project, repeatedly showcasing progress to fans over recent weeks.And why not? Assuming the final tranche of funding arrives, there should be no problem for either Everton or Moshiri, who owns 94% of the club’s shares.But the search for funds to finish the stadium – especially in the current financial climate and as neighbour Liverpool potentially seeks a buyer – threatens to become a larger issue with each day that passes without a deal, as it seems Everton could face a big bill if, for some reason, the project is not completed.The Guardian understands that if the stadium is not finished, Everton is obliged to pay to return Bramley-Moore Dock to the condition in which it found it. Experts suggested that such a bill could run to tens – if not hundreds – of millions of pounds. Everton said it was highly improbable it would have to pay those costs and declined to disclose its current estimate of this liability.All of that means that while funding to complete the stadium is being sought, financiers expect searching questions about the club’s accounts to be asked by its auditors – whoever they prove to be.In October, the Guardian revealed that Everton was searching for a new auditor after its existing firm, BDO, had refused to work on the current accounts and was considering walking away. Everton is now understood to be looking for a replacement, in order to meet a March deadline to publish its figures. Its lawyers said: “The club’s audit will be published in line with normal practice and within the regulatory timetable.”The questions being raised about the club’s finances are not confined to Bramley-Moore Dock: the source of funds fuelling the Premier League team’s day-to-day operations is also not entirely clear.An analysis of Everton’s publicly available filings suggests the club has run up a debt of about £150m with an opaque lender of offshore funds.Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morningUsing specialist sports funders – which are typically more expensive than conventional banks – is common within football, as mainstream lenders have grown reluctant to lend to clubs, fearing a backlash from fans if financial relations sour.However, Everton’s reliance on this type of credit line is a noticeable switch from the early part of Moshiri’s reign at the club. Shortly after the businessman acquired an initial 50% share in 2016, Everton’s lenders consisted of well-known banks including Barclays, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Spain’s Santander.Today, the majority of Everton’s current external loans – largely secured on property around Goodison Park – have been taken out with a company called Rights and Media Funding Limited (RMFL), a small player in the world of financing that has also lent money to West Ham United, Nottingham Forest and Spanish top-flight teams.However, while it has two directors, the company does not possess a single employee, according to its latest set of unaudited accounts. Nor does the lender have a website, a phone number or a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) registration – although Everton erroneously claimed to the Guardian that the firm was regulated. RMFL, meanwhile, said it did not need to be regulated, “as it is not undertaking regulated activity”.But what RMFL lacks in corporate accoutrements, it makes up for in confidence.Lawyers for the Cheshire-based firm said its client competed with some of the largest names in sports financing, and stated: “RMFL’s competitors in this area are … the likes of Ares, Blackstone, Apollo, Macquarie, MSD, CVC, TPG …”All of those companies have many billions of dollars under management, yet RMFL had just £190m by June 2021, itself borrowed from anonymous sources based in offshore secrecy jurisdictions including the Bahamas, the Isle of Man and the British Virgin Islands, official filings suggest.Having borrowed £190m, RMFL then lent that money out again. Strikingly, at that point, more than half of it – about £100m via three loans – was owed by Everton, according to official records.Everton would not say if it knew the identity of the ultimate source of the funds bankrolling its operations – but its owner and board appear to have been confident enough in the money’s provenance to have gone back for more.Since June 2021, the team’s debt to RMFL is believed to have ballooned to £150m, with the extra borrowing revealed by two further charges on the club’s assets filed at Companies House.While the first four of Everton’s five RMFL loans are guaranteed against property, the collateral on the most recent debt is unclear. Neither Everton nor RMFL would disclose exactly what underpins that final loan – but both said the debt complied with Premier League rules.RMFL added: “The Premier League is fully aware of, and has approved, every single facility advanced by RMFL to Premier League clubs.”But the statement appears confusing for two reasons: first, loans secured against real estate do not need Premier League consent; and, second, RMFL’s claim that its loans are all approved was directly contradicted by the Premier League to the Guardian. RMFL later said it was its “approach” that had been approved by the league.So why would a prestigious top-flight football club – with an owner whose wealth is estimated at £1.7bn and whp therefore should have a phonebook of top banking contacts – choose to finance itself in this way?Again, the responses pose as many questions as they answer.Moshiri said that Everton had been borrowing from RMFL before he bought into the club, in a relationship that dated back 11 years. “Over these 11 years and 12 seasons, the club has worked with RMFL in all but three seasons,” he said through a spokesman.Yet RMFL started appearing in Everton’s financial filings only seven years ago in 2015. An analysis of the club’s Companies House filings suggests that Moshiri’s statement could make sense if Everton’s owner considers RMFL to be linked to Vibrac, a controversial former lender of offshore funds to football clubs whose business model was cited as a reason behind a 2018 change in Premier League rules.Such a link has long been rumoured within football finance circles, but RMFL’s lawyers flatly denied it . They told the Guardian there was “no common ownership or control at all between those entities” and said the lender had its own sources of funding. Everton added it was confident its overall finances were robust and that the stadium would be built on time. A spokesman for Moshiri said he was “perplexed” by the Guardian’s questions about the club’s finances and suggested there was no public interest in analysing the club’s funding. He added that Everton was in rude financial health with access and relationships to a range of well-known lenders.As evidence of the club’s robust finances, the owner also said that Everton had low borrowings – pointing to net debts of £58.2m to the end of June 2021.That figure is correct and comes directly from the club’s accounts – but it is arguably not quite the full story as it masks the size of the owner’s contribution: arcane accounting standards mean that a further £248.2m in “loans” owed to Moshiri when the accounts were filed have been classified as “equity”."

Mullin headed the Dragons in front from a corner early in the second half, but the visitors quickly levelled through Oli Pendlebury’s free kick.Elliot Lee put Wrexham back in front with 12 minutes left and Mullin added two more late on to complete his treble. “I’d like to play either Liverpool at Anfield or Everton here [at home],” Mullin told BBC Sport afterwards. “But we’ll take whoever we get and try and do our best in the game.”Boreham Wood produced the biggest shock across Sunday’s six games, beating League One Bristol Rovers 2-0 at the Memorial Stadium.

The Everton players and manager were berated and subjected to jeers and whistles as they went over towards the travelling support after the full-time whistle.The Qatar-bound Jordan Pickford was partially at fault for Bournemouth’s opener when the England goalkeeper spilled a Dominic Solanke shot into the path of Marcus Tavernier, who slotted home.Kieffer Moore added a second in the 25th minute before all three points were wrapped up by the substitute Jaidon Anthony in the second half.Everton were beaten 4-1 at the same venue in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, and Lampard believes the performance of his players warranted the reaction from the fans. He said: “The fans have a right to be disappointed because they’ve come down here twice this week and seen poor performances and before that we’ve been going OK. And then they see that there are performances that they don’t like.“So when they see after Palace - and we can see that they gave us a welcome - they have to voice their opinion. And their opinions were right today.“The players have to respect that the fans have a right to voice their opinions – and again they were right today.”It was another long trip for the travelling support, who have now seen their team net just 11 goals in 15 Premier League matches.Everton will finish the weekend just one point clear of the drop zone with Lampard under severe pressure going into the World Cup break.Despite the reaction they received from their own fans, Lampard believes it was right for his players to go over to them. He said: “What was important today was the players went over to the fans, because they travelled down, they have to all go over.“The players – albeit the performance wasn’t good enough – are not bad lads and they were disappointed. There’s things we need to speak about and the footballing level [was not good enough].”Bournemouth ended a run of four successive league defeats with the win, but despite the welcome result, their caretaker manager, Gary O’Neil, refused to comment on his future at the club.The incoming owner, Bill Foley, is finalising his purchase of the club and O’Neil has been interim manager since Bournemouth’s 9-0 thrashing at Liverpool in August.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballO’Neil said: “I don’t want to comment on things that haven’t been confirmed yet by the club.“I’ve been in constant dialogue with them but I don’t think it would be fair of me to comment on things that haven’t been confirmed yet.”The former Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa is one of the names that has been linked to the vacancy at the Vitality Stadium, and O’Neil believes the Argentinian would do well at the club.O’Neil said: “There’s been noise for the last couple of days so huge respect for Bielsa and what he’s achieved and his reputation and the work he’s done is fantastic So I’m sure if Marcelo Bielsa was to come to Bournemouth then he would do a good job.”"
30,Jude Bellingham is a shining example of England’s emerging generation | Ed Aarons,The Guardian,Ed Aarons,2022-11-22T07:30:44Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/22/jude-bellingham-is-a-shining-example-of-england-emerging-generation-world-cup,"Midfielder is now only the second teenager to score for England at a World Cup but his arrival has long been in the makingJude Bellingham was only 14 when England began their last World Cup campaign but he was already planning for the future. “Even watching that I was only ever thinking: ‘How can I get into this team?’” the midfielder said last week.Four-and-a-half years on and the 19‑year‑old scored his first senior international goal on the biggest stage as Gareth Southgate’s side kicked off their 2022 World Cup campaign in style. The 6-2 thumping of Iran in which the 21-year-old Bukayo Saka scored two brilliant goals showed that England’s emerging generation are determined to do things their own way.“I feel the support and love from the fans, the coaching staff and my teammates,” Saka said after – like his fellow goalscorer Marcus Rashford, who came on as a substitute – he banished the demons of missing a penalty in the Euro 2020 final on his previous appearance at a major tournament. “That is all I need.”This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.Bellingham’s opener, which made him the second teenager to score for England at a World Cup after Michael Owen’s heroics as an 18‑year‑old in 1998, has been long in the making. Ever since he first played for Birmingham’s under‑18s just as England were heading to Russia in 2018, the son of a prolific non-league striker, Mark – who also served as a sergeant for West Midlands Police – has been tipped for stardom.After beating Trevor Francis’s longstanding record as Birmingham’s youngest player by 101 days, Bellingham opted to remain in the Championship for another season despite interest from most of Europe’s top clubs. “It’s a lot of success for the club and the academy,” said former manager Pep Clotet after his protege scored the winning goal against Charlton in September 2019. “For the fans to see a young player coming through – that is something you can never buy in football.”Unlike Saka, Mason Mount, Declan Rice or any of the other players in Southgate’s squad who have blossomed after being nurtured in the thriving English academy system, Bellingham has left his homeland. He joined Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2020, following in the footsteps of Jadon Sancho, who had turned down a contract with Manchester City to move to Germany in 2017. It was Dortmund’s attention to detail that attracted Bellingham and his father.“There is a person there for every player, especially Otto [Addo], who has worked with the young players,” Bellingham said in 2020 of the man who is also Ghana’s coach at this World Cup. “He is great. Everyone has that support system to work for their chance in the first team. The way they integrate young players into the first-team squad is next level. There is not a club in Europe that does it quite like them.”Bellingham this season became the only English teenager to have scored in four consecutive Champions League games, and Pep Guardiola suggested last month that the player might not have been given the same opportunities in England. “Maybe he would not get the minutes,” the Manchester City manager said. “The best thing for a young player to be better is to play minutes.”But after Southgate expressed fears in 2019 that only 15% of players in the Premier League could be eligible for England in a decade unless clubs gave more opportunities to homegrown players, last season more than 40% qualified – the highest since 2005. With an average age of 26.4 years, England have the eighth-youngest squad in Qatar and second-youngest of the European countries, behind Spain.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballSaka joined Arsenal when he was seven and became the first player born in the 21st century to play in the Premier League when he made his debut in January 2019. His development under first Unai Emery then Mikel Arteta is testament to the importance they have placed in youth in recent years. Of those who came through the academy at the same time as Saka, Joe Willock, Josh Dasilva, Emile Smith Rowe, Reiss Nelson and Eddie Nketiah have played in the Premier League this season.It is similar at Chelsea, where Mount and Conor Gallagher joined at a young age and there were six English players in their starting lineup against Leicester in August, including five academy graduates.“Our preference is to look at some really exciting young ones who’ve proved at youth level that they’re as good anything around the world,” Southgate said when he called up Mount, Sancho and a 22-year-old James Maddison in October 2018 – perhaps not coincidentally also the day he extended his contract until this World Cup. “That should give us confidence that with the right development and the right opportunity, they can translate that into the senior team.”"
31,"We love Brazilian skill, so why do we criticise their flair players so much?",The Guardian,Tom Sanderson,2022-11-24T08:00:22Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/24/brazilian-skill-criticise-flair-players-antony-neymar-richarlison-lucas-paqueta,"Antony, Neymar, Richarlison and Lucas Paquetá have all been mocked or scolded for playing with panache and trickeryBy Tom Sanderson for the Guardian Sport NetworkThe World Cup has finally started and, for some Brazil players, representing their national team may prove a welcome break from the day job. Manager Tite included 12 players from the Premier League in his 26-man squad – second only to England – and 22 in total from European clubs. Brazilian players have increasingly made home in Europe but their style is not always feted. At least once a month this season a young, skilful Brazilian has been criticised for doing what they do best: entertaining fans, expressing themselves and exhibiting their art.Most recently, it was Antony’s turn to suffer a media pile-on in his adopted home. The São Paulo product was one of new Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag’s marquee signings in the summer. The Dutchman convinced the club to pay Ajax £82m – an Eredivisie record – for the 22-year-old. The forward has enjoyed a strong start in England, setting a record as the first United player to score in his first three Premier League games. He was generally well received by fans and the media. Until he did the unthinkable and tried to pull off a trick during a 3-0 win over Sheriff in the Europa League.Former United player Paul Scholes called the youngster a “clown” after he span 720 degrees with the ball glued to his feet and then misplaced a forward pass. “That’s the way he plays,” said Scholes. “I’ve seen him do it many a time at Ajax as well and that’s just the way he is, but I think he needs that knocking out of him.” Robbie Savage called Antony “embarrassing”, adding: “If I was the manager and he did that again, I would drag him off.”Savage’s wish was granted when Ten Hag replaced Antony with Marcus Rashford at half-time. The manager said after the match that he would “correct” his player, explaining: “When there is a trick like that, it’s nice as long as it’s functional. If you’re not losing the ball, then it’s OK – but if it’s a trick because of a trick, then I will correct him.”Antony, meanwhile, was defiant. “We’re known for our art and I’m not going to stop doing what got me where I am,” he said on Instagram.The hugely popular Brazilian football pundit Paulo Vinicius Coelho sees both sides of the argument. “Like everything in the world, there’s reason in the middle of it,” says Coelho. “Brazil still sees football as if it were a team sport won by individuals when it is increasingly a collective game that is resolved by collective aspects. From this point of view, the English are correct and Paul Scholes was right to criticise him. Dribbling and tricks need to have an objective.“There is also a certain contempt in Europe for the dribble, as if it wasn’t a beautiful thing. I think there’s an exaggeration in Brazil about the aesthetics of the dribble and an exaggeration in some parts of Europe in the contempt there is for these aesthetics. But there’s a place in the middle of this. Dribbling and tricks are some of the beauties of football, but they need to lead to a chance or a goal. From this last point of view, Antony can improve how he uses tricks – tricks that aren’t to promote himself but to advance his own team.”If footballers face a battle between aesthetics and results, Brazilians have always tended to be more artful than pragmatic. But their choices have not always been appreciated in Europe. When Tottenham Hotspur forward Richarlison indulged in a few keepy-ups against Nottingham Forest earlier this season, Forest manager Steve Cooper was appalled, saying: “I wouldn’t want my players to do what Richarlison did. It wouldn’t be accepted here.”Vinicius Jr has also been criticised for doing the samba after he scores for Real Madrid, which leads to the question of just how much these Brazilian players are appreciated in Europe. Why buy skilful Brazilian wingers for their craft and then chide them for doing skilful Brazilian winger things? Would they even bother leaving home if – and this is a big if – they weren’t guaranteed higher wages and the chance to play in the Champions League? Would staying in Brazil be more fulfilling than moving to Europe, being chastised for entertaining and made to play in rigid, mechanical systems that offer little room for creativity.Moments like Antony’s are no longer allowed to pass by fleetingly, raising a smile from supporters. They are scrutinised to their limit by commentators and pundits, and used by rival fans to attack players. This feels like something new. Players such as Ronaldinho and Garrincha, artists with the ball, were lauded for their skills. Not everything they tried came off. Zico and Sócrates wowed the planet at the 1982 World Cup, but would they be branded show ponies today for crashing out of the tournament before the semi-finals?As Neymar said last year when his Brazil teammate Lucas Paquetá was booked for attempting a rainbow flick while playing for Lyon against Troyes – something that Neymar himself has been cautioned for in Ligue 1 – “joga bonito is over”.Perhaps the World Cup will give Brazilians a chance to be themselves and charm a generation of fans who have become obsessed with results over aesthetics. Maybe the current crop of players, who refined their art on muddy pitches and concrete favela courts, can win over hearts and minds by winning a sixth World Cup – and doing it in style.

32,"Ben White: ‘After training, the last thing I want to do is watch football’",The Guardian,David Hytner in Doha,2022-11-19T22:00:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/ben-white-england-world-cup-qatar-2022,"England defender on his carefree attitude to the game, rise from League Two to the World Cup, and sunbathing in QatarBen White did not watch much football during his childhood in Dorset. It was never on in the house, his parents were just not interested. Does he have any World Cup memories? “Not that stick out,” the Arsenal and England defender says. And you will not find him flicking on a match in the evenings nowadays, either.“Sitting down and watching a 90-minute game after I’ve trained all day and had four or five meetings about football … the last thing I want to do is watch more football,” he says.On the day when Gianni Infantino sparked outrage and astonishment, when the issues around this World Cup pounded like a migraine and as the pressure in football terms mounted ahead of the big kick-off, White is the antidote.Sitting under a tent at England’s training base and speaking in almost hushed tones, he discussed his laid-back temperament and how it had helped him rise to the top, dealing with rejection and season-on-season upheaval. It was difficult not to link it to an upbringing devoid of football tribalism and obsession, although the genes of his father, Barry, are also plainly at work.“My old man is so laid-back it is ridiculous,” White says. “He would just go to work, a normal bloke, a gardener, and he hasn’t got any passion for any sport. When I got called up for the World Cup squad, he was like: ‘Well done.’ It was like he knew it was going to happen and it wasn’t a surprise for him. My mum is the opposite so I think I have got the balance between them.This is a World Cup like no other.

Support our investigative journalism today.“My temperament is one of the big reasons why I am where I am. I don’t go too high or too low. I learned from getting released [by Southampton at 16]. It was a rubbish day but I didn’t cry. It was on to the next thing and it is like that after a game if you didn’t play so well. After my first one for Arsenal against Brentford [at the start of last season] I was hammered. Now they are all praising me.”White remembers how he would ride his bike down to the beach in Bournemouth as a kid to watch World Cups on the big screen but he always preferred to play himself, kicking about in his garden; ever active, carefree. “I don’t really look too far ahead,” he says. “I’m a day-to day-person. I wake up, look after that day and try to have the best one ever. I’m not someone that has anything planned for in normal life. If I want to go somewhere for dinner on the day, I’ll be going.“I didn’t think about the World Cup at all until it was close. If you’re so concerned on something, it normally doesn’t happen. Things will be what they will be and you deal with it when it comes.”It would be a mistake to think that White does not have rare inner steel, understated self-assurance, and it is suddenly visible when he discusses how settled he feels in his life, which has provided the springboard for his excellent Arsenal form.In each of the past five seasons, he has played for a different club, with loan moves from Brighton to play in League Two for Newport in 2017-18, then in League One for Peterborough and, after that, for Leeds in the Championship, where he won promotion. He stayed at Brighton in the Premier League in 2020-21 before moving to Arsenal for £50m.“Coming to League Two,” White says. “You go to a club and they are like: ‘Who is this guy?’ Then I go and smash the season and get player of the season. Then I go to a League One club and the same happens. Then I go to Leeds; no one has a clue who I am and I play every single minute. I believe in myself. I don’t think I have done it an easy way.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballWhite says he has felt the benefit of being “back-to-back at a club” for the first time in his senior career. Repurposed by Mikel Arteta, as a right-back, the adaptation has been seamless; the memory of the Brentford game and his initial difficulties in winning over the Arsenal support faded.“Looking back at Brentford, I did not actually do that badly,” White says. “I won half the duels and people said I got bullied. It is an opinion and they change a lot. It is always like that and they [the pundits] are paid for an opinion. Sometimes it is rubbish.”White is on the fringes of the England squad but he offers an option at right-back, centre-half and the right of a defensive three. “At Arsenal, we build up in a three so I’m playing centre-back every week but just on some occasions I’m flying forwards,” he says.Could White emerge later in the tournament? He is on top of his game and ready, although he will keep it chilled in between training sessions. How is he dealing with the boredom of camp? “Sunbathing,” he replies. “I sunbathed this morning. There is not loads to do. You rest and there’s recovery stuff to do. Early to bed and watch a movie. It is very nice around the pool. Very relaxing.”"
33,World Cup music: Why official singles went out of fashion,BBC News,https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,2022-11-20T00:22:05Z,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-63668308,"In 2009, World Cups changed forever. Fabio Capello, the opera-loving manager of England, banned the team's official World Cup single. The days of players standing in recording studios with headphones draped around their necks were over. The following year, as the tournament took place in South Africa, Dizzee Rascal and James Corden topped the charts with Shout (Shout for England), a World Cup version of a Tears For Fears classic. The song was not officially endorsed by the Football Association, or indeed by lovers of music. (NME's review: ""Almost as bad as England's showing in South Africa."")Qatar 2022 is the fourth World Cup in a row to which England have headed without an official song. Some might argue that this is a good thing, but for many, the squad single was a crucial part of the excitement of the build-up, a footballing equivalent of who is doing the next Bond theme.  Of course, there will always be numerous unofficial novelty singles released each time, attempting to cash in and become the next Vindaloo (the Fat Les song which reached number two during France '98). These are normally about as enjoyable as opening a packet of World Cup Stickers and getting all doublers. The last official England World Cup song was World At Your Feet by Embrace, for Germany 2006. It made number three in the charts, but did always had a touch of the Oasis-must-have-said-no feeling about it. There are several reasons for the decline of the official World Cup squad single. Firstly, players take themselves more seriously now and are less likely to make themselves available. The signs were already there back in 1990, when only six of the squad turned up for the recording of the classic World In Motion with New Order. If you have never heard Peter Beardsley's attempt at the John Barnes rap, please treat yourself now.Another problem for new football songs is that when it comes to the charts, World Cups are now very much like Christmas - the same songs return every time. Streaming has turned Three Lions into the All I Want For Christmas Is You of major tournaments. Originally released for the 1996 Euros, it has also returned to number one during two different World Cups (1998 and 2018). This year, a winter World Cup will make things particularly congested, because football and festive songs will be going head-to-head for the first time. David Baddiel and Frank Skinner are trying to navigate this by taking on themselves, with an updated sleighbell-ridden Three Lions, now with added brackets (It's Coming Home For Christmas).The song is full of references to the Lionesses success at the Women's European Championships and self-deprecating lyrics (""A football Christmas song / Not at all demeaning"").The decline of the squad single is not just an English problem, it has affected the tournament as a whole. This year it appears that, of the 32 competing nations, only the six listed below have officially-endorsed team songs. That is not even a full quarter-finals line-up.The last time Wales played at a World Cup was 1958 and the best-selling single of the year was Elvis Presley's Jailhouse Rock. A nation famous for their love of singing was not going to pass up this chance to celebrate in song. Dafydd Iwan's Yma o Hyd, which translates as ""We're Still Here"", was originally released in 1983 and has grown in stature over the years. The stirring anthem has long been a favourite of Welsh Nationalists and football fans. Instead of cringey shots of players miming in the video, the squad is shown singing along during on the pitch celebrations after qualification. There is even a little something for Scotland fans; a section of the video highlighting ""low moments in Welsh football history"" includes a flying Alan Rough save from John Toshack in a crucial qualifier in 1977. No footballer has failed a drugs test at the World Cup since Diego Maradona in 1994. Spain calling their official team single Toke might have raised some eyebrows amongst FIFA officials. Fear not, it translates as ""Touch"".  The song, which combines R&B and Latin rhythms, is performed by Chanel Terrero, who came third in this year in Eurovision with SloMo. She told El Mundo that in the video she is ""booty hypnotic"" and the dance routines certainly use more complicated formations than Barcelona under Pep Guardiola. A translation of the lyrics combines hedonism (""Tequila shot we go crazy"") with football (""Iniesta making the goal"" - a reference to when Spain won their only World Cup). A shot of two women kissing may limit its chances of being played in the host country. Billed as G.F.A x King Promise, it is worth pointing out that G.F.A. are not a dance act, but rather the Ghana Football Association. King Promise, who they recruited to provide their official song, is a genuine Afrobeat star, one who is nominated for Best African Act at this year's Mobo Awards. Black Stars (Bring Back The Love) is a rather enjoyable listen and does not shy away from name checking the players, loyally claiming ""Jordan Ayew he be top striker"", although in 14 Premier League games for Crystal Palace this season he has yet to score. The couplet ""You know is a party / And we have Thomas Partey"" means that Ghana is more likely to win the World Cup than this song is to pick up an Ivor Novello Song writing Award.  Belgium are number two in the FIFA World Rankings. Their World Cup song has also made it to number two in the Belgian charts. Warrior is a dramatic heartfelt electro-pop anthem, chosen by the Belgium Football Association because of its subject matter - dealing with overcoming your fears. ""Baby I'm a champion / no matter what they say about me,"" goes the chorus, something that is hard to apply to the national team when they are one of the great under-achievers in international football, having never won a tournament. The Belgian manager Roberto Martinez has said the lyrics have a ""transcendent quality that makes us want to fight in the noble sense of the word"". These were not words he used in 2013 when he was the Wigan manager and there was a song released to celebrate their FA Cup Final appearance called The Wigan Wiggle.  The Dutch FA turned to TV to pick their official anthem, using a popular show called I Want Your Song, where writers pitch tunes to well- known acts. Last month, there was a World Cup special and Mart Hoogkamer, a runner up on Holland's Got Talent, was paired with Minj Oranje Hart, which translates as My Orange Heart. It was quite a spectacle. In the studio, Matt sang what sounded like an 80s Eurovision soft rock ballad with a blistering intensity, while saxophones were played between goalposts, the audience started an impromptu conga and grown men wore plastic cheeses on their heads. The country that gave us Total Football, now endearingly engaging in total nonsense. No country has done more to try and preserve the official team single this World Cup than Denmark, having enticed the whole squad into the recording studio and making it look like they were having a lot of fun. Skulder Ved Skulder translates as ""Shoulder to Shoulder"", and Kasper Schmeichel translates as John Barnes, because the former Leicester keeper takes on not one, but two solos in the song. The sight of a player, who has 86 caps and has won both the Premier League and FA Cup, holding a sheet of paper while wearing headphones and singing ""I promise forever that I'll stand up for you"", with his vocals bathed in Autotune, gives hope to those who want to believe that the official team single can return to former glories in the future.Land of Song heard loudly from the football standsYma o Hyd becomes official Wales World Cup songHow Sweet Caroline became an accidental football anthemBreakthrough in nuclear fusion energy announcedWeather warnings extended as more UK strikes announcedPM pledges more staff to help clear asylum backlogWhat is nuclear fusion and how does it work?Heartbreak and heroism: Lake deaths community unitesHow long will the cold snap last?Why are Albanian migrants coming to the UK?'Emotion is driving Argentina more than ever'An in-depth look at why so many Britons are striking.

34,The Guardian view on Manchester United up for sale: give fans a say in the future | Editorial,The Guardian,Editorial,2022-11-23T19:00:43Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/23/the-guardian-view-on-manchester-united-up-for-sale-give-fans-a-say-in-the-future,"The Glazer family’s leveraged buyout of the club was a sporting scandal in plain sightThe acquisition of Manchester United by the American Glazer family in 2005 was the most egregious example of carpet-bagging in sporting history. In order to buy one of the most famous and profitable football institutions in the world, the Glazers raised £540m worth of debt and then loaded it on to the club itself. Over the past 17 years, against a backdrop of supporter protests and a decline in performance on the pitch, the Glazer ownership has cost the club more than £1.5bn in interest payments, debt and other outgoings. The family have used Manchester United as their private ATM, personally extracting vast sums in dividend payments and “management fees”, and organising soft loans to their other companies. Their ruthlessly exploitative modus operandi has been a sporting scandal in plain sight.Little wonder then, that United supporters are jubilant at the sudden announcement that the Glazers are now open to offers for the club. The scuppering of unpopular plans for a lucrative European Super League, along with the post-Abramovich sale of Chelsea to American buyers for a £4.25bn investment, appears to have convinced the family that now might be the right time to cash out. Earlier this month, the American owners of Liverpool came to the same conclusion, putting another world-famous English institution on the market. According to Forbes, United are worth £3.9bn, but that figure may rise dramatically in a bidding war. Early reports suggest the Glazers may be hoping for £6bn. Their departure – albeit with pockets bulging – would be a piece of uplifting news for a sport in which treasured institutions have received minimal protection from the game’s nominal stewards. For far too long, the Premier League and the government have sat back and allowed the upper reaches of football to become a playground for unscrupulous profiteers, hedge funds and sportswashing states. Some United fans will be breathing a sigh of relief that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, having been permitted to buy Newcastle United last year, is unlikely to come knocking at the Glazers’ door.In the absence of anything resembling robust scrutiny of would-be buyers, sporting integrity and the wellbeing of the wider game have become afterthoughts. Accountability to the supporters and communities that nurtured and sustained these wealth-generating vehicles has been entirely absent.The spectacle of Manchester United and Liverpool – the country’s two most famous clubs – up for sale should concentrate minds both in Westminster and at the Premier League. Exactly a year ago, the fan-led Crouch review of football governance – set up in the wake of the European Super League debacle – called for an independent regulator for the game, a strengthened owners and directors test, and a bigger voice for fans. Implementing these proposals would be a start, but the idea of reclaiming the game for ordinary supporters seems a distant dream.The Glazer family should never have been given the opportunity to inflict their business model on Manchester United. Fans, whose protests may have contributed to the family’s decision to explore a sale, can celebrate a breakthrough moment. But the problems of governance at the top of English football run wider and deeper."
35,Graham Arnold calls for more resources and reform in Australian football,The Guardian,Emma Kemp in Doha,2022-11-29T17:39:57Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/29/graham-arnold-calls-for-more-resources-and-reform-in-australian-football,"Graham Arnold has expressed “massive concerns” over the state of football development in Australia, putting the onus on the national governing body on the eve of the Socceroos’ decisive World Cup group match with Denmark.In what could be the final pre-match press conference of his four-and-a-half-year tenure, Arnold put forward his views on the state of the nation and called on Football Australia to conduct a thorough review.When the 59-year-old replaced the interim coach Bert van Marwijk after the 2018 World Cup, he and his assistant, René Meulensteen, also took charge of the national under-23s team with a view to breaking the Olyroos’ 12-year-old Olympics drought and transitioning those younger players into the national team.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.“It was a quick fix and it’s not right,” Arnold said on Wednesday. “Whatever happens with this World Cup, I think the organisation needs a review of what’s going on in junior development. Because when I went to Russia in 2018, when I first got appointed to the job, and I watched the them play, I could see straight away that Cahill, Jedinak, Milligan, Kruse – an ageing squad was there.“I’d already taken the job and I needed to find players, and then when I started looking there was nothing coming through. And when you’re ringing A-League coaches – and you are talking about two players per club – I could barely put a squad together to go to [Olympic qualifiers in] Thailand and even to Cambodia.”Nine of the under-23 players who competed in the Tokyo 2020 Games last year are in the 26-man senior squad in Qatar – the faces of a new generation exceeding expectations.But Arnold said the stopgap salve – which also includes selecting players born and bred overseas, particularly in Scotland – would not stand the test of time if resourcing is not increased and existing infrastructure not reformed.Having spent years coaching in the A-League with Sydney FC and Central Coast, he has spoken repeatedly about the lack of sufficient game time for young players in Australia’s 26-round top-tier competition and the yawning gap in resources between that and the semi-professional second-tier National Premier Leagues.Further down still, children’s development at the grassroots is often blocked because of exorbitant registration costs and academies not always harnessing the best young talent.“You need more kids to give an opportunity in Australia,” Arnold said. “For me there’s massive concerns for the future, moving forward, unless it’s fixed. It was a quick fix, and that’s why I did the Olympic thing for nothing. I asked the organisation: ‘What’s the Olympic program?’ – and it’s 10 days’ preparation and they didn’t even have a coach two months before.Sign up to Guardian Australia SportGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk“At least now Tony Vidmar’s in charge of that. The Socceroos are just the icing on the cake and whatever that icing, whether it tastes good or bad, the most important thing is the ingredients. The ingredients are junior development and junior national teams, and if that’s not right and the icing will not taste very good.”Arnold said he would “hire about 150 people” if hypothetically given the reins to make meaningful change but clarified his future remains undecided – whether Football Australia offers him a new contract or not.“At this moment I’m focused on this, then I’m focused on having a break,” he said. “The game is growing and growing right across the world, and Asia is growing so quickly.“People can sit back at home and their opinion is maybe Saudi and Japan are not that good, but look what they’ve done – they’ve beaten Argentina and they’ve beaten Germany. Asia is throwing a lot of money into football and we need to catch up and do the same thing.”"
36,"‘After a while it eats you up’: Kevin De Bruyne on dealing with the spotlight, life at home and whether he gets paid too much",The Guardian,Simon Hattenstone,2022-11-26T07:00:20Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/26/kevin-de-bruyne-manchester-city-belgium-world-cup-home-life,"The Manchester City midfielder – currently leading Belgium’s golden generation in their last stab at World Cup glory – is football’s quiet genius. He gives a rare look at the family life of a Premier League superstarConfession. I’m a Manchester City fan. Another confession. Kevin De Bruyne is my favourite player. In 30 years of journalism, I’ve never interviewed a City player. Don’t meet your heroes, they say. The whole thing is discombobulating. De Bruyne – one of the world’s great players – has agreed to a rare interview. But there’s a caveat. If you talk to me, he says, you also talk to my wife, my kids, you do it at our home and you get to know us all. Usually, it’s the opposite – you don’t talk to my family, you don’t come to my home, it’s all about the work rather than the private life. Strange.We meet a few weeks before the start of the World Cup. He’s beginning to think about it. But in typical De Bruyne fashion he dispenses with diplomacy and tells it as it is. No, he’s not happy about it being in Qatar. Yes, it is a distraction from the Premier League. No, he doesn’t think Belgium have much chance of winning.Now he’s out there hoping to prove himself wrong.At his best on the pitch, virtually everything is channelled through him. Often he will start a move by winning the ball and running with it in the same movement. Though he plays in the centre, he sets up goals by overlapping on the wing to put in crosses of such pace, swerve and accuracy that they are impossible to defend. And while goal-scoring isn’t his main thing (he prefers to assist), last season, when he scored four goals against Wolves, commentator Alistair Mann quivered: “Kevin, stop it! I’m running out of superlatives for you!”In 2020, De Bruyne became the first City men’s player to win the prestigious PFA Player of the Year, and won it again the following season. In September, he was named the world’s best passer in the video game Fifa 23. Earlier this month, the game Football Manager 2023 ranked him the greatest player in the world.De Bruyne doesn’t run with the football pack. We never see him out getting into trouble. In fact, we pretty much never see him. Which makes today even stranger. But it also makes a kind of sense. “Away from football, it’s all about family,” he says. “This is my life.”Michèle Lacroix, AKA Mrs De Bruyne, greets me at the door. She apologises for still being in her bathrobe, shows me in and makes coffee. The house is everything you’d expect: huge driveway, extension the size of a small hotel, artworks galore, carpets like quicksand. Coco, the white-grey cat, is so perfectly coordinated, you wonder whether she came with the furnishings. Yet it’s also homely. Toys spill out of the playroom and De Bruyne’s office obviously doubled up as the home-schoolroom in the pandemic (one wall is plastered with spelling tests).De Bruyne is nowhere to be seen, so Lacroix introduces me to Coco, the three children and her mother. We chat and drink, and it’s only after a while that I realise De Bruyne is also now in the kitchen. He is wearing a brown tracksuit, has a wispy gingerish beard and bears more than a passing resemblance to his cartoon compatriot Tintin. He glides through his house like a ghost: if he hadn’t shaken my hand and introduced himself, I probably wouldn’t have registered his presence. He floats off to the fridge, takes out slices of white Hovis, makes himself a mustard sandwich, heats up green soup and starts eating. All without a murmur. De Bruyne is a paradox. He is both famously shy and famously outspoken. A number of stories shape the mythology around him. The first is that at eight he turns to his father and says he wants to leave his club, KVV Drongen, because the training sessions at Ghent, another local club, are better. Second, now playing for Ghent, he gets so enraged when told off for not helping to clear up the pitch that he grabs one of the posts and refuses to let go. Three adults try to pull him away but fail, and his coach, Frank De Leyn, has to stay with him because De Bruyne tells him he is planning to hold on all night.Fast forward a few years for another classic tale: De Bruyne is on the verge of the first team at rival Belgian club Genk, living there with a foster family during the week, when they decide, two years in, that they don’t want him to live with them any more because he doesn’t fit in; he’s too quiet. Finally, there is the time, aged just 20, when he gives a half-time interview ripping into his Genk teammates for shirking: “I’m ashamed of them. I suggest that those who don’t have a desire to play just leave,” he says at the time.His management team are also here today and he’s talking to them in a quiet, flat voice. It’s so understated you almost tune out. Then you hear what he’s saying. Asked if Belgium can win the World Cup, he says, “No chance, we’re too old.” It’s only seven months ago that Belgium were ranked No 1 in the world. De Bruyne says that because the tournament is being played in Qatar in mid-season, it doesn’t feel like a real World Cup. One of his reps says it must be a dream playing with Erling Haaland, the extraordinarily prolific striker at City. “Ach, it’s like any forward.” Even he thinks his response is underwhelming. “He is so quick, though,” he adds. He finishes his soup, cuts up some blackberries and grapes for baby Suri, who is sitting in her highchair having her hair primped for the photoshoot. He says his childhood was so different from that of his children. His father worked in a factory painting trains, his mother was a housewife, and he describes his background as “lower-middle class”. What was he like at school? “I was OK. Smart enough to know how much I needed to do and to finish it. I left at 18 with a diploma.”I ask why so many European footballers seem better educated than their British counterparts. Perhaps the difference is languages, he says. “There are a lot of people from different countries who speak two or three languages, where English players usually only speak English. I come from a country where by 13 you are studying Dutch, French and English.” With languages, perhaps comes wisdom and humility – an ability to put yourself in the shoes of others, a knowledge that your way is not the only way. He smiles. The Belgian way was never going to be the only way, he says. “Everybody in Belgium always watches English TV anyway!”I tell him I recently watched footage of him playing as a young boy and his style has hardly changed. Even if you blocked out his face, it could only be De Bruyne. “I know!” He takes out his phone and compares two photographs. “This is from a couple of months ago when I scored against Bournemouth. Look at the way I kick the ball. And this is a picture of me shooting when I was a kid. Identical! Same technique!”Are Mason, six, and Rome, almost four, promising footballers? “No,” he says. “They don’t play.” Are they not interested? “I don’t know,” he says, as if he’s never considered it. “They like to go to the football. My oldest plays piano a bit and likes to run. He’s a good runner.”I ask about the famous stories. Did you really cling to the goalpost and refuse to budge? “I think the stories are a bit made up.” So it’s not true? “I don’t remember it. It could be true!” Does it sound like him ? He grins. “I was a little bit stubborn, yeah. I let most things go, but when I do say something I am outspoken. I know now when you speak as a teenager or a kid to an adult with an opinion, people don’t like it … even if it’s true.”Was that the case when you suggested your Genk teammates were not trying? De Bruyne pinkens. He often flushes like this – when he’s embarrassed, when he’s upset on the pitch and when he’s made one of his superhuman runs. “Yes! The problem is the fans like that and other people like that, but the team doesn’t.”A hairdresser is here to give everyone a trim before the photoshoot. While it’s De Bruyne’s turn, I chat to Lacroix. She’s a model, a social influencer (with more than 350,000 Instagram followers) and she recently started a Flemish podcast called Secret Society with a few Belgian girlfriends. Her parents are physiotherapists and she wanted to be a doctor when she was at school. “I never thought my life would look like this. Getting a degree was my main goal then.” When she was 17 and De Bruyne was 21, they started dating. Apart from it being her husband’s career, she has no interest in football and certainly had no ambition to be a footballer’s wife. Can she see what makes him a special player? “I don’t know a lot about football, but I think he sees things before the others maybe. He’s always one step ahead?”She’s encouraging Suri to finish her fruit. “Everyone thinks she’s called Surrey,” she says. “‘Ello, Surrey!’” She does a good impression of a cockney. Rome is building a racetrack on his mini computer. He shows me how to do it, but I can’t keep up. Mason asks for a go of my tape recorder. “I’m going to interview you. What’s it like working for media? What’s your favourite colour?”De Bruyne emerges from his haircut looking pleased with himself. “I’m like 24 now! I could be a model!” We head back into his office and he and Lacroix sit together on the sofa. I ask her how life has changed since they got together. For starters, she says, they weren’t living anywhere like here. Back then he was just making a name for himself and they could pretty much do what they wanted socially. “Football-wise, it’s got better and better. But then we could do more normal stuff. On a city trip, say, maybe two or three people would come up to us. Now we’re more isolated. So you do more things at home with friends. Kevin has grown more open because we’re in such an intimate circle, always with the same group. He’s more comfortable with who he is.”“I’m more open-minded to life,” De Bruyne says. “When I was younger, it was just football. Now I have a family, life is different.” In fact, he says, it’s remarkably similar to many other working people – he drops the kids off on his way to work, trains, comes home, family meal with the kids, helps with the homework, watches telly. He admits there is one way their life is noticeably different from the rest of ours – they spend more money on stuff. This is partly because they can and partly because they pay extra to buy their privacy. “We have to live our life in a more secluded way. Often, if we go on a tour it will be a private tour, and most of the time this stuff is more expensive and more individual.”Lacroix says this is not a choice. When she and the kids go out without De Bruyne, they can do whatever they want. But with him it’s a different story. “Yesterday we thought we’d try going to the fair and Kevin made at least 100 pictures. Maybe 150. And the kids had to wait all the time, and it wasn’t enjoyable for them. At one point security came up and we thought they’d help, then they said, ‘Can we have a picture?’” She laughs. She’s not asking for sympathy, she says. In so many ways it’s a wonderful, privileged life. But it isn’t without problems. “When I’ve been driving to the club lately,” De Bruyne says, “there have been people driving next to me and filming. People have followed me.”After games, Lacroix adds, “People just jump in front of the car so you can’t drive. Then the one next to them goes for a picture so you can’t go anywhere.”Top footballers get paid ludicrous salaries and are idolised by their supporters. De Bruyne is City’s best-paid player, earning an estimated £385,000 a week – £20m a year. In 2020, he cut ties with his long-term agent, Patrick De Koster, after he was arrested on suspicion of fraud. The investigation was reportedly triggered by complaints from De Bruyne himself. Last year, he negotiated his own contract extension using data analysts to prove his worth to the club.All the money and worship must change you, I say. “I don’t necessarily think it’s the money, it’s the attention. If you go from no attention to wherever you go people give you attention, then that changes you. You either take everything in or block everything out. Some people like all the attention, but after a while it becomes so much you get eaten up by it. Then if you push it out you seem arrogant. It’s a thin line you have to walk.”In terms of attention, he says, it’s harder for the top English players: “Because I’m a foreigner living here, I’m still OK. When you’re an English player, the attention flows from everywhere. It would be too much for me.” Does he think he gets paid too much? “No. I compare it to a singer at a concert and 60,000 people come. I look at it logically. There are millions of people watching the football on TV, there’s 60,000 watching the games, the income of a club is £500-£600m. Yeah, it’s a lot of money, but is it too much? If the club can afford it, it’s not too much. It’s not a popular answer, but that’s how I see it.”How hard is it for them to relate to people struggling with the cost of living crisis? “We are really close to our family and friends, and most of them have normal jobs, so we know the struggles,” Lacroix says. She looks at De Bruyne and asks him to translate an expression. “We stay with our feet on the ground,” he says. “It’s easier for us to understand, but it will be harder for the kids because they’re used to a certain lifestyle. They go to a private school and there are people from similar backgrounds. They understand when we go to see our families it’s different types of houses and another lifestyle.” It worries him: “We’ll try, but it cannot be the same as when we grew up. It’s not possible.”When he was a child, he says, his parents didn’t have much, but it was plenty: “We had what we needed; a nice garden.” Does he have siblings? “One sister. She did trampoline and was pretty good at it. But she didn’t have the character to go on like I did.”So many promising footballers fall by the wayside. Fewer than 0.5% of the kids in English academies at the age of nine make it as professionals at any level. So what is character? “It’s will. It’s saying no to fun stuff. At 17, 18, a new social life is beginning, people are going out, having fun with friends, and you have to say no.” That must be hard? “It is, and that’s why many people fall down at that stage. You have to become an adult quickly in football. When you start playing with the first team, you’re living with 30-, 35-year-olds; people with kids. It’s not easy and you need to learn that quickly, because if you don’t, you fall out. Elite sport is brutal.”Did he find it tough as a teen? “Yes. I also missed part of my life because I went away from 14. We’d play on a Saturday, then I would go home to see my parents and on Sunday evening I’d travel back. So I missed the whole social part of my life.” Was he jealous of his friends? “Not at that time. Maybe afterwards. Later, when you experience things, you think perhaps it would have been fun to be doing this when everybody else was.”It was his decision to leave home at 14: he was desperate to play football, and his parents were supportive. I ask if the story about being dumped by his foster family is true. “Yes,” he says. “There were three of us and the other two were more sociable. At summer break I said bye to the family and went home. Then my parents told me, you’re not going back, they don’t want you any more.” He says the foster family never said anything directly, but told his parents they didn’t want him because he was too quiet, too difficult, a teenager who didn’t fit in. To add insult to injury, Genk told him he had to go to boarding school instead. In Belgium, boarding schools are more for problematic than privileged students. “I really didn’t want to do it.”Did that rejection make him question his character? “No. I thought I’m going to push more and show them. I said to my parents, I will do good, you’ll see. I’ll be in the first team quickly, then everything will change.”There is a YouTube film about De Bruyne that depicts his life as a triumph over tragedy. “Right from the beginning he was abandoned by his foster family,” it says. “And still life didn’t stop hitting him with tragedy after tragedy.” It goes on to document how the 20-year-old signed for Chelsea in a £7m deal and played only three Premier League games before being sold as a flop.Has he seen the film? “No.” In the film, it mentions a match in which he came on as a half-time substitute and scored five goals. Every goal, it says, was a way of answering the foster family: “One goal, they don’t want you any more. Two goals, too quiet. Three goals, too difficult. Four goals, they don’t want you any more. Five goals, because of who you are.” When I describe this, he turns a pinker shade of pink. “That’s not true. I don’t know who said that, but it’s not true. I find that a little bit embarrassing, to be fair.” Now he’s laughing. “My life wasn’t that bad, to be honest!” De Bruyne says too much was made of his time at Chelsea when he left, and too much was made when he returned to the Premier League a couple of years later with Manchester City. “When I came here people said, ‘Chelsea reject.’ No, I was just a young boy who didn’t play and was there for six months. I was really young.”Leaving Chelsea was the making of him. He signed for Bundesliga club Wolfsburg in 2014 for £18m, ended the 2014-15 season with 16 goals and 27 assists in all competitions and was named Germany’s footballer of the year. In August 2015, Manchester City signed him for £55m. Those who remembered his unhappy time at Chelsea couldn’t believe how much City paid for him. Former Liverpool player Phil Thompson said: “The world is going mad. The amount of money they’re paying for this boy is just absolutely bonkers.” But it turned out to be a bargain. In four of his seven seasons, he has been voted player of the season, and City have won the Premier League four of the past five seasons. In 2017-18 they became the first (and still only) club to get 100 points in a season and the following season won an unprecedented clean sweep of domestic trophies.Eight months after De Bruyne arrived at City, Pep Guardiola became manager. It was the catalyst for the club’s greatest run in its history. For most of my life as a City fan, I was used to nothing but failure; between 1976 and 2011 the club didn’t win a trophy. Thanks to huge investment from its UAE owners, the signing of great players and arguably the best manager in the world, City have dominated the Premier League for the past decade.Sign up to Inside SaturdayThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of our brand new magazine, Saturday.

Does it bother him? “Honestly, I don’t know too much about that. All I can say is when we speak to people from the Emirates, they’re all really good and polite. I can only speak highly of them, especially Khaldoon [chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak]. You speak to him and he’s a normal person.”I ask Lacroix if De Bruyne finds it easy to turn off from football. “Yes. He comes home and it’s like, ‘Oh my God, I need a break’, so he’ll watch NBA or Formula One. If he’s injured and City plays, me and the kids just leave him alone in front of the television, because when something goes wrong he shouts. I’m like, nothing is going to change, then he shouts at us, and I’m like, OK, let him just watch the game, and after he’s like, sorry!”De Bruyne has never been sent off for City. But there is a famous clip of him losing it with his teammates at the end of a Champions League match against Napoli in 2017 when he wants to confront the referee. De Bruyne, at his pinkest, shouts “Let me talk” five times. Every time his voice gets louder and more high-pitched. In the end, he sees sense and walks away.I ask Lacroix to do an impression of him getting angry. “One time when he was injured he threw a bottle of water on the floor with full strength. He couldn’t walk but still managed to get up to the television to shout at it.”“I just want my team to win,” De Bruyne says meekly.Suddenly the door bursts open and Spider-Man flies into the room. He removes his head gear, and it’s Mason. “Are you going to answer questions?” Lacroix asks. “No,” Mason says. Is it true you’re more interested in playing piano than football, I ask. “Yes,” he says.Despite City’s domestic success, they have yet to win the Champions League, the most prestigious club tournament in Europe. How important does De Bruyne think it is? “I don’t think it’s that important. It would be nice, but I think it’s more from the outside. It’s a stick people can beat City with. ‘Oh, you’ve done this but you haven’t done this.’ OK, but we’ve still done really good.”Who are his best friends at City? “I would say probably Kyle Walker and Nathan Aké.” That’s surprising, I say. Walker seems quite different from you. (Walker was splashed across the front pages of the tabloids after hosting a party with sex workers during lockdown.) “Not really,” De Bruyne says. Is that the media? “I don’t know about media. Obviously there have been issues in the past for him. But from day one I have been close to Kyle and he has three kids and they play with my kids.” I ask about Belgium’s chances in Qatar, wondering if he’ll be more diplomatic this time. But he’s not. “I think our chance was 2018. We have a good team, but it is ageing. We lost some key players. We have some good new players coming, but they are not at the level other players were in 2018. I see us more as outsiders.”De Bruyne, at 31, is at his peak. It’s hard to imagine him playing with such pace for much longer. Does he feel it’s getting tougher?“I am fully able to do what I need to do, but I feel the difference compared with eight years ago. I need more treatment, more rest.”“When he was younger, the day after a game he’d be like, ‘We can go and play tennis,’” Lacroix says. “Now the day after he’s like, ‘I need to rest. My body hurts.’”Lacroix says football has brought her the lifestyle she dreamed of. The only difference is she had always imagined she would make her own money. What’s the worst thing about being a footballer’s wife? Often she feels like a single parent, she says. “For example, Kevin has never been to one school nativity. I’m always the parent on their own. It’s rare he can go to something for them. Two of the kids are at school, so we only have weekends to do things with them, but Kevin is playing then. It makes it harder to do stuff together as a family. Kevin always says now we need to be disciplined for football and later we can enjoy everything together.”Does she think when he retires that will be her time to pursue her dreams? “That’s what everyone keeps saying. But I don’t think so now. I’m devoted to being with the kids, and I’ve just started the podcast.” “She’s the glue,” he says out of nowhere. Then he looks embarrassed. “I don’t want to say that because tonight she’ll say, ‘My God, look what you’ve said.’”Lacroix: “No, I don’t do that. I do not.”“Yes, you would,” he says. “If I said you were the glue to the family, you’d say, ‘Remember you said that.’”Do you mean Michèle would use it against you?Lacroix: “Noooooooo.”De Bruyne: “Of course!”Lacroix: “He’s making it up!”They seem to have a lovely relationship.I ask if he is planning for life after playing? She looks at him, curious to hear the answer: “He gets annoyed when I ask about it. ‘I’m still playing!’”De Bruyne: “Not really.”Lacroix: “You do a bit.”De Bruyne: “Well, I do things to advance the future. I’ve got my Uefa A and B coaching qualification already.”Does he think he’ll stay in football?De Bruyne: “Probably, yes.”Lacroix: “100%. Kevin loves football way too much to not be in it. He should because it’s in his heart as well.”But he could simply retire, live a life of luxury, make up for lost time on the self-indulgence and dossing front.“It would never happen,” Lacroix says. “Give him one month, then he would be annoyed. When Covid started he was running around the sofa. I couldn’t cope with him at home.”They go to have their photos taken. I stay in the office staring at his platoon of man of the match awards. I pop in to see how the shoot is going. De Bruyne is trying to juggle all three children in his arms and I’m worried he may get injured. I’m not sure Pep would be happy.On the way out, I tell him that at away matches my daughter Maya and I get into the ground early when it’s almost empty and shout for waves from the players when they come out to warm up. Nearly all have given us waves, but never De Bruyne. You’re so intensely focused? “I think so, yes. I’m very different on the pitch to when I’m here. Once I’m playing football it’s a different zone. Then when I’ve finished, the game is done.”For many years, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo were the undisputed two best players in the world. But things are changing. In August, De Bruyne was runner-up in the Uefa Men’s Player of the Year award, won by another oldie, Karim Benzema. How important is it to be regarded as one of the best in the world? The quiet, diffident De Bruyne looks at me with magnificent imperiousness. “It’s not important to be regarded as one of the best,” he says. “I want to be the best.”The next few weeks with Belgium at the World Cup will provide the perfect stage for him to prove that he is.  This article was amended on 26 November 2022. Kevin De Bruyne’s club at the age of eight was KVV Drongen, not “Drogen” as an earlier version said; and his wife Michèle’s surname is Lacroix rather than LaCroix."
37,Manchester United need owners who see supporters as partners not problems | Andy Green,The Guardian,Andy Green,2022-11-23T21:00:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/nov/23/manchester-united-need-owners-who-see-supporters-as-partners-not-problems,"Better owners try to understand the institution they own and look to work with the cultural groove of the clubAfter 17 years, Manchester United are finally on the market and the roundly detested ownership of the Glazer family appears to be coming to an end. But what does a good, and realistic, outcome for United supporters look like? What can a football fan reasonably expect of an owner of their club in 2022?The simpler days of the local businessman (always a man) chairing the board, putting their hand in their own pocket to build a new stand or to sign a new player, compares favourably in fans’ minds to a world of sovereign-wealth funds, oligarchs or American “sports entrepreneurs”. Yet the reality of those days was never as good as our sepia-tinted collective memories suggest, and all recent transactions for Premier League clubs indicate it will be financially driven buyers looking to acquire England’s leading clubs. Even local lad Sir Jim Ratcliffe is motivated more by his belief that top-flight teams will continue to grow in value, than his support for United. After all, he tried to buy Chelsea.It is not unreasonable, however, for fans to expect any owner, whether financially driven or not, to understand the history and culture of a club, and to realise they are custodians of an institution that will last long after they have gone. Clubs endure, through ups, downs, relegation, promotion – even insolvency – and they do so because the supporters endure, through families and friends, tying people together in common cause.For an owner of a club, this persistence of loyalty is one of the attractions of ownership, but it places an onus on them to nurture the asset of which they have temporary charge. Even at the scale of United and Liverpool, whose American owner has also been looking for new investors, the institution is more than a business. Supporters don’t switch clubs like consumers switch brands of trainers or washing powder. The better owners – and Fenway Sports Group probably fits that description – work to understand what they own, to work with the cultural groove of the club.In many ways, owners and supporters should be aligned. The paradox of the shift over the past 20 years from match-day to media and commercial income at the largest clubs is that match-going supporters are no longer the golden goose to be plucked but instead part of the global offering, seen and heard on TV. The gradual adoption of safe standing in England shows a growing understanding that noisy, atmospheric grounds benefit the club and the fans; the relationship is symbiotic not oppositional.Many supporters look to the German ownership model as a template; banners emblazoned with “50+1” could be seen prominently at various grounds during protests against the European Super League. Yet the model is hard to apply in England. German clubs began as members’ organisations and the 50+1 rule was a way of allowing controlled commercialisation, not a mechanism to roll back rampant commercialisation of the sort exhibited in the Premier League. The value of English clubs makes such a structure virtually impossible to achieve. No current or future owner is likely to give away billions of pounds of value, not to mention control, to supporters.But supporter ownership on a material scale remains the best way to formalise and cement the relationship between fans and owners. Recent discussions between the Manchester United Supporters Trust (Must) and the Glazers about a fan share scheme show the beginnings of a way forward. Any move to an element of supporter ownership will inevitably be gradual and frustratingly slow, but having supporter shareholders, especially organised by a properly constituted supporters trust, is good for the majority owner. The board of any company should welcome passionate, long-term, loyal customers on to its share register, and a wise owner, wishing to cement their relationship with the United fanbase, would work with Must to give supporters an opportunity to own a real stake in the club.As the structure of Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter shows, even those with the deepest pockets can’t fund everything themselves. The Chelsea takeover by a consortium led by Todd Boehly has a significant debt element, including a £500m loan and a £300m revolving credit facility. Debt will almost inevitably be part of any purchase of United, or at least part of future investment plans for Old Trafford, but the lessons of the past 17 years are that excessive leverage, taken for the wrong reasons, can prove a deadweight, preventing investment and providing no benefit to the club.Any new owners at United need to work to understand the true nature of what they have bought into, and recognise the transient nature of their connection to what is an institution of cultural importance. We need owners who see supporters as partners not problems, and who give them an opportunity to have a stake in the club. And after a billion pounds has flowed out of United solely for the privilege of servicing the Glazers’ debt, we need owners who show financial prudence, and only borrow to invest back into the club. That’s not too much to ask.Andy Green is a Manchester United supporter and writer on football finance"
38,"Twitter may not cope with World Cup abuse, says Kick It Out chair",The Guardian,Dan Milmo and Paul MacInnes in Doha,2022-11-18T11:39:37Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/18/twitter-may-not-cope-with-world-cup-abuse-says-kick-it-out-chair,"Sanjay Bhandari says cuts in trust and safety team at platform could be taken as ‘green light for hate’The chair of the anti-discrimination body Kick It Out has voiced fears that Twitter will be unable to cope with online abuse during the football World Cup, after a wave of job losses at the social media platform.Sanjay Bhandari said he was deeply concerned by reports of cuts in the trust and safety team at Twitter, as well as the departure of the executive in charge of the department.“I am deeply concerned that the reduction in the trust and safety team and the departure of the leader of that team will be taken as a bright green light for hate,” said Bhandari. “I fear that industrial-scale levels of hate during the World Cup will go unchecked by Twitter.”Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, axed approximately 50% of Twitter’s 7,500-strong workforce this month. In the wake of the firings, Twitter’s head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, said 15% of his team had been let go.Roth left the company soon after. Last weekend, more than 4,000 Twitter contractors, including people who worked on content moderation, reportedly had their roles terminated.Overnight, there were reports of widespread resignations among the remaining 3,700 staff at Twitter after Musk set a 10pm GMT deadline for workers to commit to being “extremely hardcore” or else leave with three months’ severance pay.Bhandari said moderation on Twitter had been “been opaque, inconsistent and understaffed at the best of times”, and he was concerned that the platform would struggle to cope with a rise in user engagement among football fans after the World Cup begins on Sunday.Before Roth departed, he said, Twitter had been subjected to a coordinated trolling campaign that bombarded the platform with abusive content in an apparent attempt to convince users that it had relaxed content guidelines.A recent study revealed that more than 300 abusive tweets a day are sent to Premier League footballers, and nearly seven in 10 players receive abuse on Twitter. The research by the Alan Turing Institute, the national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, found that 60,000 abusive tweets were directed towards Premier League players in the first half of last season.One of the authors of the report said Twitter’s ability to deal with abuse of footballers could be affected by the jobs cuts.“We are aware that Twitter are working with a smaller workforce,” said Pica Johansson, a researcher in the online safety team at the institute. “And there might be, for that reason, less ability for them to respond quickly to some of this type of abuse that we do see.”The institute’s research found that less than 10% of the abusive tweets were identity attacks that referred to a protected characteristic such as race, gender or sexuality. However, Hannah Kirk, an online safety researcher at the institute, said racist or nationality-based abuse might be more prevalent at the World Cup.“I envisage the big difference between the Premier League and the World Cup is global attention and also heightened awareness of nationalism, which potentially intensifies the stereotypical links between race and nation. We might then see a little bit more racism or nationality-directed abuse than we would in the Premier League,” Kirk said.Nonetheless, the Football Association is confident it will be able to act if Twitter becomes a focus for abuse of its players, as it did during last year’s European championships.Football bodies within England established a fast-track reporting system last year, and the FA has confirmed with Twitter that the same support will be available in the coming month and that resources will be made available for moderation.The FA also uses third-party agencies to monitor for abuse and report on its behalf. This week, Fifa and the international players’ union Fifpro announced a similar scheme, a “social media protection service” (SMPS) that would be available to players in all 32 nations competing at the World Cup.Allowing for the scanning and reporting of offensive content, the SMPS will also let players with social media accounts automatically hide comments that are judged offensive. This service will apply only to posts on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, with Twitter understood to have been excluded from the process owing to technical issues.Twitter has been approached for comment."
39,Europe shows Infantino the way on the pitch – now it must do the same off it | Philipp Lahm,The Guardian,Philipp Lahm,2022-11-25T07:30:00Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/25/europe-shows-infantino-the-way-on-the-pitch-now-it-must-do-the-same-off-it,"The roots of football, the strongest leagues and the last four nations to win the World Cup all hail from the continentThe World Cup began with a Europhobic tone. In Gianni Infantino’s speech the Fifa president, attacked Europe. He accused its representatives of arrogance, double standards and self-centredness. He overlooked one point: the centre of football is indeed in Europe: historically, culturally, economically and sportingly. Only in Europe is it possible to have a great career in top-level football.Europe dominates contemporary football. In the World Cup that is clearer than ever. The last time the final of the tournament was played without a European team was almost three-quarters of a century ago. The last four world champions are Italy, Spain, Germany and France – and three of their four opponents in the final came from Europe. In 2006 and 2018, the semi-finals were all European.The dominance in club football is even clearer. Everything is pointing towards Europe, to the five big leagues, and this trend has intensified since the creation of the Champions League in 1992. The last world-class footballers to really shine outside Europe were Pelé and Zico. Diego Maradona spent his best years in Spain and Italy, Lionel Messi went to Barcelona as a child, Neymar at 21. From the starting XI of the last non-European world champions, Brazil 2002, only one never played in Europe: Marcos, the goalkeeper.Talent is evenly distributed across the globe. South America develops many great footballers, Africa has great players – but they always take the final step in a European league. The last world champion teams where this was different were Brazil and Argentina in the 1970s.Now the Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay teams consist almost exclusively of footballers from the Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 or Serie A. Teams with a different profile have virtually no chance of reaching the semi-finals at the World Cup, not to mention winning the title. The hosts, Qatar, failed against Ecuador because the South Americans had in Enner Valencia someone who had developed his game in England.The first impression of this World Cup is that Europe will give Infantino the answers on the pitch. England displayed some weaknesses in defence, but scored six goals against Iran. The Netherlands, the three-time World Cup finalists, defeated African champions Senegal. For the French, Australia will not have been the last opponent against whom they are superior in all positions. From the first minute, Spain once again displayed the clear style that sets them apart from everyone else: attacking possession. The 7-0 against Costa Rica was an uneven duel. Belgium, Denmark, Poland and Croatia were also well organised. Europe’s players perform and thanks to them the tournament is attractive.Italy, the European champions, are not in the tournament, nor are the former World Cup finalists Sweden and Hungary. Nor are the Czech Republic and Slovakia, who, when they were part of the same country were in the final twice. Erling Haaland, possibly one of the defining strikers of the next decade, is absent in Qatar because the European qualifying section was too strong for Norway. If World Cup places were awarded according to only sporting criteria, Europe would have more than 13 of the 32 participants in Qatar.Only Germany were off the mark. They were leading 1-0 against Japan when Hansi Flick substituted three Bayern Munich players as well as one each from Chelsea and Manchester City, and replaced them with squad members with little Champions League experience. In a way Germany beat themselves as Japan’s goalscorers in the 2-1 win play in the Bundesliga.Otherwise, Europe’s teams are usually assertive on the world stage and provide sports politicians with a template to follow. If there is one criticism of them it is that they have betrayed the values of enlightenment the continent stands for. For many years, their focus has been on high individual profits and not on the responsibility football has to assume in society.What has happened to Fifa, a European institution based in Zurich, which was founded out of a desire for international solidarity by Sweden, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Denmark and Switzerland?Football needs new representatives to deal with its credibility crisis. They can go back to its origins. A century and a half ago, it began its global march in England, Scotland, Switzerland, soon followed by Spain and Germany. It was so successful because it was part of the labour movement and democratisation. It made social advancement possible and required fair play. It was given life in the club culture.To this day, these roots are the strength of football. Now the task is to defend these achievements. For Europe, it is a matter of self-preservation. Cooperation is needed, football is a team sport.The first steps have been taken. Giving the World Cup to Qatar 12 years ago is now largely accepted to have been a mistake. In Qatar, some European associations wanted to join forces to send a signal for diversity with a colourful captain’s armband. However, it was naive to rely on Fifa’s leniency in doing so. In the power struggle with Infantino, a Swiss of Italian origin, Europe is lagging behind.The teams are giving up the armband, but that cannot be the last word. Supported by the strong performances of the players, Uefa’s associations must fight back in unity, of course, with allies from other continents. We must save the values of football and what this game expresses.Philipp Lahm’s column was produced in partnership with Oliver Fritsch at Zeit Online, the German online magazine, and is being published in several European countries"
40,Senegal’s beach ballers aim to cause earthquake by shaking up England,The Guardian,Ed Aarons,2022-12-03T13:00:45Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/03/senegals-beach-ballers-aim-to-cause-earthquake-by-shaking-up-england,"African nation has produced an array of talent in recent years but must overcome key absentees to succeed in last-16 gameThere is a daily ritual on Senegal’s beaches that begins just as the sun starts to set at about 5pm. Roughly divided by age, hundreds of young men play football until it gets dark or the tides of the Atlantic Ocean wash away their pitches and the discarded tyres being used as impromptu goalposts.It only takes a few minutes of watching the dazzling array of skills on show to understand why Teranga Lions have won Africa’s Beach Soccer Cup of Nations on seven of the past nine occasions, although it needed another penalty shootout victory over Egypt to claim their fourth successive title in October.It is no accident that last season Senegal, with 51, was the African country with the highest number of players in the top five European leagues – a total that put them 10th on the global list. Thanks to the pathway provided by academies such as Dakar’s Génération Foot – which helped to produce Sadio Mané and Ismaïla Sarr because of its links with the French club Metz – a country with a population of 17 million continues to punch above its weight.The president, Macky Sall, awarded every player in Senegal’s squad £64,000 and two plots of land for their shootout victory against Egypt in the Africa Cup of Nations Cup final in February in recognition of their historic triumph. But Saer Seck, who set up the Diambars academy with the Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira in 2003, believes that achievement could be topped by beating England at the World Cup in Sunday’s last-16 showdown. “It would be an earthquake,” he says. “This a very big moment for the team and everyone is prepared to play the game of his life.”This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.Diambars, situated in Saly on Senegal’s Petite Côte, is where Idrissa Gueye and Saliou Ciss began their careers before joining clubs in Europe. But with the team’s talisman Mané out of the tournament and the experienced defender Ciss not selected, Cheikhou Kouyaté sidelined by a hamstring injury sustained against the Netherlands and Gueye suspended, the coach, Aliou Cissé, will face England without four of the side that started against Egypt in Yaoundé.“With Sadio it’s another story,” says Seck, a former vice-president of the Senegalese Football Association. “The team is no longer individuals because the strongest is not here, so we have to fight together to succeed. But each team has its own injuries so we can’t cry about that. Against England we will be missing four players due to injuries and suspensions and they all have a lot of experience. So it’s a different team but they will all be focused and ready to fight.”In Qatar, Cissé has been happy to allow El Hadji Diouf – a teammate from the side that famously reached the last eight at the 2002 World Cup – to do most of the talking. The former Liverpool forward is Sall’s special adviser for sport as he targets becoming president of the Senegalese FA one day, although there is no doubt who calls the shots when it comes to the team.“Aliou has proved he is an excellent coach with very strong and solid knowledge of the game,” says Seck. “He has been in football for more than 30 years and has been our manager since 2015. All his boys understand what he is telling them to do in preparation for the games. And this is enough to inspire them to follow him when they go on to the pitch. Having Aliou Cissé in charge of this team is one of our biggest strengths.”Khalilou Fadiga, a former Bolton and Coventry winger and another member of the famous 2002 side who were defeated by Turkey after shocking the holders France in the opening match thanks to Papa Bouba Diop’s winner, is also in Qatar to add his experience to the Senegal party. But could the ice-cool Cissé, who captained that team before playing for Birmingham and Portsmouth in the Premier League, become the first African manager in the Premier League one day?“If you had one clever president in the Premier League I think that he could be a very good manager,” says Seck. “I’ve been very close to him in the management of the national team for a long time so I know him very well and I’m sure he has the ability to lead a very good project in club football. And I know that Aliou Cissé is prepared to go there and make it.”For now, Cissé has his sights set on making more history against England. After the victory in Seoul over their former colonial masters France 20 years ago Senegal’s then president, Abdoulaye Wade, declared a national holiday and Seck is adamant that overcoming Gareth Southgate’s side could have even more significance.“This would be more historic because it would mean a place in the quarter-finals,” he says. “I think that England are the favourites but the game is not yet over. We are talking about football and, in football, faith is very important. Our team has faith, courage and we will fight. It won’t be easy for England – there’s definitely a quiet confidence about our team. Let’s see what happens but we will be ready to take our chance.”"
41,Declan Rice indicates he wants to leave West Ham as he outlines ambitions,The Guardian,Jacob Steinberg in Doha,2022-12-01T12:41:50Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/01/declan-rice-wants-leave-west-ham-trophies-champions-league-england-world-cup,"Declan Rice has indicated he wants to leave West Ham, saying he wants to win trophies and play in the Champions League. The England midfielder has no intention of extending his deal and is expected to be sold for a big fee next summer.Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United are interested and Newcastle may enter the race if they qualify for the Champions League.It is thought West Ham will allow their captain to leave, even though they will hope to deter bidders by demanding a large fee of at least £100m. Rice’s contract runs until the summer of 2024, with the option to extend by a year, and he has rejected offers of a new deal.The 23-year-old is desperate to play at the highest level and has said playing for England increases his desire to compete for major honours. “One hundred per cent I want to play in the Champions League,” he said. “For the last two or three years I’ve been saying that.“I’ve been playing consistently well for my club and I feel like I really want to keep pushing. I see my friends here who are playing Champions League and for big trophies.“You only get one career and at the end you want to look back at what you’ve won and the biggest games you’ve played in.”Rice is in line to start when England face Senegal in the last 16 of the World Cup on Sunday and believes the rest of the qualifiers should be worried.“Other nations will always look at us and think about the quality we’ve got in the squad,” he said. “Why should we not be feared? If you look at our attacking players, there are world-class, unbelievable talents across the board. There are players who have played in the biggest games and won the biggest trophies. We are one of the biggest teams here.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“But it’s down to us to prove it on the pitch. Teams like the French have proved that. They’ve won a World Cup. They’ve done it consistently. Now we want to change that. We’re not just here to get into the round of 16. We want to go the whole way. It’s up to us to prove it.”"
42,Alejandro Garnacho sinks Fulham with last-gasp Manchester United winner,The Guardian,Jonathan Wilson at Craven Cottage,2022-11-13T18:46:00Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/13/fulham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report,"Paul Tierney blew his whistle, the ball dropped out of the sky and was grabbed by Tim Ream, and history was made as the Premier League, for the first time ever, broke for the World Cup. The final game before the six-week shutdown was an enjoyable romp that culminated with that most familiar of tropes, a last-minute Manchester United winner, slid in by the 18-year-old substitute Alejandro Garnacho.A crisp evening by the Thames. The bells of All Saints welcoming the throng through Bishops Park. Smoke rising from the fast-food vans into the chill, clear air. The trees an autumnal gold. In the morning, a gentle mist had hung over the river, perfect for the old maids to cycle through on their way to holy communion. It was the sort of November day that has made trips to Craven Cottage so evocative since it first became the home of Fulham in 1896. It certainly was not the sort of day to make you feel as though, a week less half an hour after kick-off, the World Cup would be getting under way.Of all the issues raised by this World Cup, perhaps the least important is the way it has disrupted the rhythm of European seasons. There have even been suggestions that some teams may not be taking the Carabao Cup entirely seriously. Yet it has had an impact, as the number of players already ruled out of or in danger of missing out on the World Cup makes clear.There has never before been a gap of fewer than 16 days between the Champions League/European Cup final and the start of the World Cup; for there to be less than seven days between the end of domestic action and the start of the tournament inevitably augments the sense of football as a remorseless treadmill, fixture after fixture following in endless, accelerating succession, and can only increase the issue of fatigue.The result was a distinct last day of term feel about Fulham, of this somehow lacking the dread earnestness of most match days. Uniform guidelines were perhaps relaxed, some of the younger classes brought in games, there were squabbles in the staff-room over the one working video recorder and the tape of the Tom Hanks film Big, and nobody really bothered too much with the boring stuff, like defensive structure or playing the safe pass. The result was a very open and thoroughly engaging game that swept from end to end with exhausting intensity.There was certainly no obvious sign of players holding back. Nor was there any suggestion that the absences of five players who could have major roles to play at the World Cup – Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphaël Varane, Antony and the suspended Diogo Dalot for United and Aleksandar Mitrovic for Fulham – were down to anything other than bona fide issues, but the shadows they left contributed to the air of vague abandon. Harry Maguire, lionheart of the England back three, at least should be fully rested, having spent the evening on the bench; he has played just 90 minutes of Premier League football in the past two months.Yet this was a game of consequence. The win took United to within three points of fourth-placed Tottenham with a game in hand; the gap to Champions League qualification looks manageable.The absence of Ronaldo is of increasingly little concern to United. United have lost half the Premier League games he has started this season, averaging just a point a game, as opposed to 2.2 per game without him. United’s opener was finely constructed, evidence of the sort of football Erik ten Hag is looking to instil – and the reason why he eschews Brazil’s first-choice holding midfield pair to deploy Christian Eriksen alongside Casemiro. The Brazilian dispossessed Tom Cairney after 14 minutes, Eriksen then setting Anthony Martial running before advancing to slide in Bruno Fernandes’s cross at the back post.The player who was missed was Dalot, the combination of Willian and Antonee Robinson repeatedly troubling his stand-in Tyrell Malacia down the Fulham left. Sure enough, that was where the Fulham equaliser originated, the duo combining to lay in Cairney to cross for the United old boy Dan James, who had been on the pitch just three minutes, to turn in.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballThere was still almost half an hour plus injury time to play at that point and, for a time, until the introduction of Garnacho restored some thrust to the United attack, Fulham looked the likelier to score. But it was United who, in the third minute of three minutes added time, grabbed the winner, the Argentinian drifting in from the left, exchanging passes with Eriksen and nudging his finish past Bernd Leno.And then, poof, it was gone, the excitement doused, the stands emptied, the floodlights turned off to make way for Fifa’s shameful folly in Qatar, not to be reignited until Boxing Day."
43,Mick Beale leaves QPR to make Rangers return as new head coach,The Guardian,PA Media,2022-11-28T17:35:58Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/28/mick-beale-leaves-qpr-to-make-rangers-return-as-new-head-coach,"Rangers have announced the appointment of Mick Beale as their new manager.The 42-year-old, who was previously assistant to Steven Gerrard at Ibrox, has left his role as QPR boss to take over from Giovanni van Bronckhorst, who was sacked last week.Upon confirming Beale’s appointment on a contract until the summer of 2026, Rangers declared him as “undoubtedly one of the most sought-after young managers in British football”.“It is fantastic to be back and to see everybody this morning, there are some new faces but some people that I know really well so it is great to see everyone,” Beale said. “I am hugely proud, it is a wonderful, wonderful football club, it is an institution. For everyone that works here it is a huge privilege, but to be the manager of this football club, that is extremely special. Some wonderful people have sat in this chair prior to me, and I am hugely proud to be the person sat here now.”Beale only became a manager in summer 2022 after QPR lured him from Gerrard’s backroom team at Aston Villa in June. He made a swift impact at Loftus Road as he led the club to top spot in the Championship a little over a month ago before they failed to win any of their last five matches before the World Cup break.The Londoner’s impressive start to management in west London drew the attention of Wolves in October. He turned down a move to Molineux, but has been unable to resist the opportunity to return to Scotland.QPR’s director of football, Les Ferdinand, admitted it was “a blow” to lose Beale. “Naturally we are hugely disappointed to lose Mick,” he told the club’s website. “Our extensive research when we were looking for a new head coach highlighted him as being very much aligned with the direction we are moving in as a football club.“The start to the season we have made, coupled with very attractive football being played, gave us cause for optimism as we looked to build on the previous three seasons. That optimism remains but there is no doubt it is a blow to lose Mick so soon into his tenure.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballFirst-team coaches Neil Banfield, Damian Matthew and Harry Watling have also left QPR to join Beale at Rangers. B team manager Paul Hall will take over first-team duties at Loftus Road while the club look to identify a new head coach.Beale has a little over three weeks to prepare his team for his first game at home to Hibernian on 15 December. The Ibrox side are currently nine points adrift of city rivals Celtic at the top of the cinch Premiership and are out of Europe after losing all six of their Champions League group matches."
44,Australia's 'Jockeroos' look to Scots for World Cup support - Reuters.com,Reuters,,2022-11-16T17:28:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/australias-jockeroos-look-scots-world-cup-support-2022-11-16/,"DOHA, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Aaron Mooy is hoping Australia's strong Scottish connection might bring a few more supporters on board as the Socceroos plot a tricky path out of Group D at the World Cup.While Scotland failed to qualify for Qatar, the Australian squad features three Scottish-born players and Mooy is one of seven who play club football in the country's Premier League -- leading some to dub the team the ""Jockeroos"".""I didn't know about that name,"" the Celtic midfielder laughed at Australia's training camp in Doha on Wednesday.""There's lots of 'high Scottish' players here.

""It's a good league and a competitive league.""They're doing well and they bring lots of energy into the group – lots of hunger.

45,Meet the 22-Year-Old Star Who Could Make Team USA a World Cup Contender,Time,Charlie Campbell,2022-11-18T12:00:13Z,https://time.com/6234829/world-cup-2022-brenden-aaronson-usa-leeds/,"A piercing whistle blast officially marks the end of soccer training on a squally afternoon at Leeds United training ground in northern England—but Brenden Aaronson isn’t heading for the showers just yet. As his exhausted teammates trudge toward the locker room, Aaronson places a ball 25 yards from goal, takes a breath and pings a fearsome shot into the far top corner. And then another. Not that the 22-year-old New Jersey native considers the extra scrub anything out of the ordinary.“Normally I’m the last one out there shooting but today I was just messing around,” he tells TIME in an exclusive interview on Nov. 3. “I ran so much in our last game that I had a little bit of a calf strain.”That last game was a stunning 2-1 victory for Leeds over title challengers Liverpool, during which Aaronson ran 8.2 miles—the farthest any English Premier League (EPL) player has managed all season. It’s a work ethic that combined with Aaronson’s deft ball control, tactical nous and passing alchemy persuaded Leeds to stump up $30.2 million for his signature in May—the second-highest fee ever paid for an American, after Christian Pulisic—and has propelled him to be the U.S.’s hottest soccer prospect for generations, carrying a huge weight of expectation into the World Cup in Qatar. A youthful U.S. team has had mixed results going into the tournament—most recently a 2-0 defeat to Japan and a goalless draw with Saudi Arabia—but Aaronson is confident there’s sufficient quality in the squad to claim a few scalps. The U.S. team’s three group stage matches start against Wales on Nov. 21, followed by England on Nov. 25 and Iran on Nov. 29, with only the top two from the quartet qualifying for the knockout stages.“Yeah, we’re underdogs,” says Aaronson, who grew up in Medford, N.J. “But going into the World Cup … we want to win, so we’re going to give it our all and try to go to the final.”Read More: Your Complete Guide to the U.S. Men’s National Team at the 2022 World Cup in QatarIt’s a hard-nosed attitude that persuaded Leeds United manager Jesse Marsch—who in February became just the third American to manage an EPL team—to build his team around Aaronson and former New York Red Bulls midfielder Tyler Adams, who is also heading to Qatar. “He’s a silent assassin type,” Marsch says of Aaronson. “He’s just the nicest kid, you don’t think that he’s a hard-edged guy, but when it comes to game time, he’s willing to do whatever it takes to find a way to succeed.”Alliteration demands that Aaronson is dubbed by fans the “Medford Messi”—after diminutive Argentina legend Lionel Messi, who will also be playing in Qatar—although he in fact lists his soccer idols as former England midfielder Steven Gerrard and Spain striker Fernando Torres, who both starred for Liverpool in the 2000s. “I wear my hairband because of Fernando Torres,” Aaronson reveals. “I got [the style] from him.”Aaronson played all kinds of sports as a kid, including baseball, basketball, lacrosse, and American football. But soccer was always his passion and one he happened to share with his private investigator father, Rusty, who played college soccer for Monmouth University. “From a young age, my dad always told me that ‘I want you to be the one that runs the most,’” says Aaronson. “It was never ‘train like this, do that,’ the only thing he wanted from me was just to work harder than anybody else.”The elder Aaronson even set up a youth soccer team in the neighborhood chiefly to provide his son with a competitive sporting environment to nurture his undoubted potential. “[My dad is] the most important character in my career,” says Aaronson. “I’ve had a lot of fantastic coaches over the years, but my dad is the number one person in my life who has helped me get to where I am today, and who I based my morals off.”Aaronson played for Philadelphia Union’s youth teams from the age of 13, joining the Union-run high school at YSC Sports in Wayne, N.J. He says growing up in Medford was “a kid’s dream.” Aaronson and his buddies would bike all over the town, which is interspersed by small lakes. Summers revolved around playing soccer in friends’ backyards and then diving into the water to cool off. “I was fortunate to grow up the way I did.”He was accepted to attend Indiana University before deciding at the 11th hour to instead sign a professional contract with the senior Union team, where his 19-year-old brother, Paxten, plays today. Asked which of the siblings is the superior player, Aaronson grins and throws his younger brother a tribute, even if fraternal rivalry prohibits full bragging rights. “My brother is so talented,” he says. “I always like to say how good he is. He’s going to get more chances as he gets older because he’s still young, of course.” Notably, both brothers scored in their first Major League Soccer (MLS) starts.As for his own game, Aaronson’s not coy about areas where he can improve. “There’re so many things,” he says. “I can score more goals and get more assists. I want to get stronger, so I’ve been in the gym a lot.” He is also first to admit that going professional in his teens was risky coming from an American sports system, where the established route is college and draft, supposedly providing a safety net should things go awry. “It is a different culture [in soccer],” he says. “With me, it was more about just taking the chance of a lifetime.”The gamble worked. In October 2020, Aaronson was signed by Austria’s Red Bull Salzburg in a deal reported to be worth up to $9 million, the highest transfer fee ever paid for a homegrown American player from the MLS. Aaronson made the transition to Europe seem easy, winning a league and cup double in both his two seasons at the club. But in truth, he says leaving his family to move alone to a faraway country where he didn’t speak the language was a huge challenge at such a tender age. At the Union, Aaronson was still living at home with his mom cooking and caring for him.“Going to grocery stores, trying to find the food that I needed, there were just a bunch of things that were tough [in Salzburg],” he says. “I was lonely at times, but I got used to it and I really had time to focus on my football and get better.”Read More: Climate Change Drove Nepali Workers to Qatar to Build the World Cup Stadiums. It Also Made Their Jobs More DangerousThe transition from Salzburg to Leeds was easier and Aaronson’s all-action displays immediately cemented his place as a fan favorite. “Leeds are soccer fanatics and in Philly, it’s all sports, so it’s kind of similar,” he says. “The fans are just so loud and really drive us on.” And he’s found English culture easier to adapt to: “I’ve tried the tea, I’m into tea, I change up between coffee and tea,” he laughs. Ultimately, though, there are some South Jersey staples that the U.K. just cannot replicate. “I love the hoagies back home,” he says, “they’re the best.”While he is currently living alone in the historic spa town of Harrogate near Leeds’ training ground, Aaronson will be joined by his girlfriend—who recently graduated from college in the U.S.—after Christmas, which his parents plan to spend with him in the U.K. “Christmas in England!” he grins. “Can’t wait to see it.”In the meantime, cognizant of how short and uncertain professional sporting careers can be, he’s been knuckling down to online college courses at Southern New Hampshire University arranged as part of his Union deal. “I’m not really sure what I want to specialize in,” he admits. “I’m just getting some credits done but have been slowing down a little bit because it’s been busy and then the World Cup is coming up.”Nobody is sure quite how this Team USA will fare on the world’s biggest stage. Coach Gregg Berhalter made the bold choice to ditch the fading veterans—who flunked their bid to qualify for the 2018 Russia World Cup—and instead cultivate a youthful squad with the energy and athleticism to engage an aggressive pressing style. Aaronson’s tireless running and ability to retain the ball under pressure encapsulates the shift from the previous generation’s direct approach to a more sophisticated possession-oriented philosophy.But whereas Leeds have built their team around Aaronson as the playmaker roaming behind their main striker, Berhalter has leveraged his versatility, deploying him variously on either wing or farther back in deep midfield. “Gregg is very tactically aware and I learned a lot from him,” says Aaronson. “In the national team, I sometimes have to roll up my sleeves and play wider and deeper. It’s just about being flexible.”While the squad’s talent is undeniable, a deliberate focus on youth, coupled with the fact the U.S. failed to qualify last time out, means big tournament experience is sorely lacking. Much will hinge on how well Berhalter, who himself was part of the U.S. squad that made the World Cup quarter finals in 2002, can guide his young charges. Those who know Aaronson best don’t expect the occasion to overwhelm him, though. “Brenden can have a big World Cup, no doubt,” says Marsch. Regardless of the team’s performance, the popularity of soccer is set to keep rising in the U.S. Cultural phenomena like the success of shows Ted Lasso and Welcome to Wrexham, as well as the fact the next World Cup in 2026 is being held across North America, is belatedly boosting the global game at home. “By the 2026 World Cup, I think [soccer] will overtake some other sports in America … It’s rising up to baseball” says Aaronson. “2026 is going to be hysteria in the country—and it’s going to be awesome to see.”Write to Charlie Campbell at charlie.campbell@time.com."
46,Joe Willock applies finishing touch as Newcastle add to Chelsea woes,The Guardian,Louise Taylor at St James' Park,2022-11-12T19:40:13Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/12/newcastle-chelsea-premier-league-match-report,"Graham Potter may have benefited from a recent “Glow Up” but his players seem to be experiencing a bit of a messy makeover. Given Chelsea have failed to win any of their last five Premier League games, it has proved somewhat less successful than their manager’s new hair style, as, thanks to Joe Willock’s sumptuously curling winner, Eddie Howe’s renascent Newcastle registered a sixth straight victory.“I rate Joe very, very highly,” said “an immensely proud” Howe at the end of an evening in which the midfielder thoroughly upstaged England’s Mason Mount and Conor Gallagher. “Joe’s continuing to improve but he’s very important to us.”Willock and co go into the World Cup break third in the top tier with the domestic season’s impending six-week hiatus apparently the only thing that can apply a brake to the extraordinary momentum which promises to sweep them into next season’s Champions League.Chelsea’s growing fear of missing out on Europe was reflected by their body language at the final whistle when Kai Havertz briefly found himself at the centre of a finger-pointing melee. Although it began with Havertz squaring up to Newcastle’s Dan Burn the conclusion seemed to be more about his Chelsea teammates losing their cool and arguing with each other. Tellingly such recriminations continued as they headed down the tunnel and Howe’s players began a mini lap of honour.“It doesn’t get any easier, we’re in a bad place; we need to go away and regroup,” said Potter whose side suffered a third straight defeat for the first time since José Mourinho’s troubled tenure in 2015 and now sit eighth, eight points behind fourth-placed Tottenham.“It’s not nice to get bad results. But sometimes you have to accept your struggles. There’s been a lot of learning in the last eight weeks. The first half was relatively even but Newcastle are a very good side. Defensively they’re one of the best teams in the Premier League; they don’t make it easy for you. But we made too many unforced errors.”He blamed tiredness. “You could see the difference in the schedules; we looked fatigued but our schedule’s demanding,” Potter continued. “Newcastle have one game a week. It showed. We’re just hoping the guys going to the World Cup come back in a good place and we can re-focus.”Chelsea had flown north without Raheem Sterling. The forward has been suffering from migraines but is still expected to join up with Gareth Southgate’s Qatar-bound World Cup squad. Newcastle’s key striker, Callum Wilson, is also Doha bound but he spent most of the evening on the bench after recovering from a virus and watched Chelsea almost imperceptibly lose control of a first half in which they barely created a single chance and Willock won his central midfield duel with England’s Gallagher.Unlike certain other colleagues the latter was at least industry personified. It was not Gallagher’s fault he struggled at right wing-back in the second period after being relocated to an unfamiliar role following Potter’s attempt to recalibrate his formation.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballGallagher created Chelsea’s sole real moment of menace when he cut inside and stretched Nick Pope to the limit with a curling shot the England goalkeeper proved brilliantly equal to. Howe identified it as a key turning point, stressing that Pope has contributed a great deal to Newcastle’s four clean sheets in the past six League games.With Bruno Guimarães’s style slightly cramped by Potter’s decision to man mark Howe’s Brazil midfielder, Newcastle’s high possession quotient did not translate into multiple chances.Even so, Édouard Mendy denied Chris Wood at point-blank range after Joelinton flicked on Kieran Trippier’s cross, while Miguel Almirón conjured an excellent chance Sean Longstaff could only lift over the bar.Undeterred, Almirón controlled a bouncing ball before dribbling across the area and, just when he seemed set to shoot, overran it and laid it off to Willock instead. As the midfielder sent a first-time shot curving beyond Mendy, any remaining radiance drained from Potter’s face."
47,Manchester United to sue Cristiano Ronaldo and ban him over interview,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson,2022-11-18T12:12:49Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/18/manchester-united-to-sue-cristiano-ronaldo-and-ban-him-over-interview,"Manchester United have appointed lawyers to explore potential action against Cristiano Ronaldo for alleged breach of contract after claims made by the forward in a recent interview as the club seek to engineer his departure as quickly as possible.It means Ronaldo will almost certainly never play for United again and it is understood the 37-year-old has been instructed not to return to the club’s Carrington training base after his participation with Portugal in the World Cup in Qatar.With Ronaldo wanting to leave and United intent on being rid of him, the question is how his exit will unfold. United’s stance is that he should not receive a payoff and they would like the process completed as quickly as possible. Ronaldo’s position is unclear, so the club are keeping all options on the table.United’s strategy may be to hope that the threat of legal action will cause Ronaldo to offer to annul his contract. When speaking to Piers Morgan on Talk TV, Ronaldo made a series of allegations. These included that he is being forced out by the club, that senior executives lacked empathy after his newborn son died in April, that the owners, the Glazer family, do not care about the club, and that the manager, Erik ten Hag, does not respect him.On Friday a club statement said: “Manchester United has this morning initiated appropriate steps in response to Cristiano Ronaldo’s recent media interview. We will not be making further comment until this process reaches its conclusion.”Ronaldo’s contract is worth about £500,000 a week and expires in June. United had no prior knowledge of the interview given by Ronaldo, who wanted to leave in the summer. He is due to arrive in Doha on Friday at 11pm local time with the Portugal squad before the team’s first training session on Saturday afternoon.Ronaldo is in his second spell at United after a supremely successful six years that ended in 2009 with his having won three Premier Leagues, the FA Cup, two League Cups, the Champions League and the Ballon d’Or. His individual contribution made him a hero for United fans and ranked him among the club’s greatest players.Ronaldo’s return in summer 2021 was greeted ecstatically by supporters and hailed as a coup by Ten Hag’s predecessor, Ole Gunnar Solskjær. But in going public with his claims against United Ronaldo has seriously damaged this standing and status.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballThis followed his walking out before the end of the July friendly with Rayo Vallecano and October’s 2-0 league win over Tottenham. Despite this, Ten Hag made Ronaldo captain for the league game at Aston Villa on 6 November, which United lost 3-1. It seems this will be his final appearance for the club."
48,There may be no clear conscience with this World Cup but we can focus on Fifa | Max Rushden,The Guardian,Max Rushden,2022-11-14T08:00:35Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/nov/14/there-may-be-no-clear-conscience-with-this-world-cup-but-we-can-focus-on-fifa,"As we consume the football on show in Qatar despite knowing the brutal facts, we should at least force Fifa to make change So here we are then. Premier League season on pause while the lower leagues keep chugging away. Knackered and injured players off to a country where it’s illegal to be gay, where women who are victims of sexual assault can be put in prison and where thousands of migrant workers have died since Qatar was awarded the tournament 12 years ago. Welcome to the World Cup.Of course, we all know these things by now. In fact the impact of hearing about them again and again seems to numb you from the brutal facts. It’s easier to just talk of migrant workers as a homogenous block rather than remembering that each life is a father, a son, a brother – most, but not all, of these are impoverished young men from Asia and Africa.We have by now also worked out what our relationship is going to be with this World Cup. From a full boycott at one extreme to free flights and tickets in return for some positive tweets and keeping an eye on those around you. Fan by day, Stasi by night.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.This tournament is football’s equivalent of a dirty burger – you know it’s come from the power-washed off cuts of a cow following a life on death row bunched up with thousands of others before being slaughtered. But you just have to eat it.It’s instinctive to get excited by the World Cup – smiling at that picture of James Maddison with England face paint as kid, losing yourself in Dafydd Iwan’s Yma o Hyd, or watching the Uruguay squad announcement film and just thinking how much you love football. There’s a beautiful moment where the Australia midfielder Cam Devlin chokes up when he gets the call from his manager, Graham Arnold.The Guardian Football Weekly podcast has recorded a number of special programmes that we’ll release alongside previews of the tournament this week, specifically on the lives of the LGBTQ+ community, the rights of women and the treatment of migrant workers. The reality for these people has been written about extensively: gay dating apps populated by people masquerading as love interests to arrest or beat up genuine users. Meanwhile women rely on a male guardian for virtually all of their rights. And some of the migrant workforce – female domestic workers can experience a hidden life of abuse and violence, while men live in terrible conditions in insufferable heat – have paid the ultimate price. What’s most striking is how difficult it is to speak to anyone on the record, such is the fear of reprisals.Unicef ambassador and LGBTQ+ ally David Beckham is being paid a reported £150m over the next 10 years to be an ambassador for Qatar. He has such power and influence that criticism has been thin on the ground from the football world. His support for this tournament legitimises it in the eyes of so many. It’s such a grave disappointment, such hypocrisy – a legacy completely tarnished. How much money does he actually need?Tim Cahill, Cafu, Samuel Eto’o, Ronald de Boer and Xavi are all ambassadors, too. All with their name alongside a quote on the website. “It’s easy to believe in the legacy projects when you see for yourself all the good they’re doing,” notes the Barcelona manager. Who to listen to? Xavi or Human Rights Watch? It is almost impossible to find unambiguous support for the tournament from anyone who isn’t in some way paid by Fifa or the Qatari state.Jürgen Klopp was, in part, right that it isn’t a footballer’s responsibility to be a human rights activist, but footballers are humans too. They live in the world. They have the power to do more than just say: “I’m a football person, I can only talk about football.” See the Socceroos’ powerful video and Jackson Irvine’s call for LGBTQ+ rights to see how it can be done.And we are all hypocrites – I don’t know the working conditions of whoever made the hard disc on this laptop. I didn’t check whether my coffee was fair trade this morning. We can all do better. And there are of course human rights abuses in all countries. But the logical extent argument is that you can’t criticise anything without criticising everything.So can we watch with a clear conscience? Can we feel the agony of England’s defeat in pure footballing terms? Why did Gareth wait until the 115th minute to bring on James Maddison?Sign up to The RecapThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionAnd what can we realistically do? How much, if any, lasting change will this World Cup create in Qatar is impossible to know. And we will move on quickly. Oh look, it’s the fourth round of the Carabao Cup.But we can at least go into this competition with our eyes open. And focus on Fifa. The #PayUpFifa campaign is worth fighting for, despite Qatar’s labour minister calling it a publicity stunt. The secretary general of Amnesty, Agnés Callamard, has called on Gianni Infantino to break his silence on the creation of a workers’ compensation fund of $440m (£370m) – equal to the player prize-money pool. Neither Qatar or Fifa wants to accept responsibility. You fear they wouldn’t budge even under a huge wave of pressure. But why not at least try to force their hand?Fifa has insisted it “remains in positive continuing dialogue” with labour organisations and the Qatari authorities over “initiatives that will benefit migrant workers in Qatar long after the final game of the World Cup”. It has also said there had been a “great response” to Infantino’s letter calling for teams to “focus on the football”, with various teams backing it. But that does not answer the question that remains for the rest of us: What should we all do?I’ve been a member of Juan Mata’s Common Goal for a few years, committed to donating 1% of my annual earnings to charity. For this World Cup I’ll give the same again to the families Fifa won’t compensate. It’s not a huge gesture – perhaps I’m just trying to make myself feel better. Some will say that’s not enough, that you can’t just offset human rights, moreover people’s lives, and they might be right. But it’s something."

He takes over at the DW Stadium with the club 22nd in the table having won six of their 21 games, after winning promotion as League One champions under Richardson last season.The cief executive, Malachy Brannigan, said: “We are delighted that Kolo has become the new manager of Wigan Athletic Football Club, and the board are pleased that he is the man to take us forward.“We received a high calibre of applicants for the manager’s job in recent weeks, in a very thorough recruitment process as we looked to appoint the right person for the role. From the earliest of conversations we had with Kolo, it was evident to us that he had instantly bought into the values of the club with his enthusiasm, knowledge and immense desire to work and be part of Wigan Athletic shining throughout the process.“There is no doubt that this appointment is an exciting one for the football club. Kolo is a manager who wants to play a positive brand of football and will strive every day to make the club stronger.”Touré, a former Ivory Coast international and Africa Cup of Nations winner, first came to English football when he joined Arsenal in 2002. He won the Premier League as a member of the Gunners’ Invincibles side in 2004 before going on to win another title with Manchester City in 2012.He later had spells with Liverpool and Celtic before moving into coaching under Brendan Rodgers, first at the Scottish club and then at Leicester. The former Crawley manager Kevin Betsy and Ashvir Johal, who had been working alongside Touré at Leicester, have also been appointed to Wigan’s coaching team.Rob Kelly, who had been caretaker manager since Richardson’s departure and oversaw a win over Blackpool in their most recent game, is to remain at the club as an assistant manager. James Beattie, however, has left his coaching position.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballTouré will now link up with the first-team squad at their mid-season training camp in Turkey.

50,Saudi government would back private bids for Manchester United or Liverpool,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson,2022-11-24T20:15:26Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/24/saudi-government-to-back-private-bids-for-manchester-united-or-liverpool,"Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal, Saudi Arabia’s sports minister, has said his government would definitely support any private sector bids from the country for Manchester United or Liverpool.While the Saudi Public Investment Fund backed the purchase of Newcastle United last winter, Prince Abdulaziz said private businesses in his country have a strong interest in English football’s most successful clubs, with both instructing banks regarding potential investment or sale.“From the private sector, I can’t speak on their behalf, but there is a lot of interest and appetite and passion about football,” he told BBC Sport. “It’s the most-watched league in Saudi and the region and you have a lot of fans of the Premier League. We will definitely support it if any [Saudi] private sector comes in, because we know that’s going to reflect positively on sports within the kingdom. If there’s an investor willing to do so and the numbers add up, why not?”The prince also stated a wish to see Cristiano Ronaldo play in Saudi. The 37-year-old is a free agent after leaving United by mutual agreement this week and he recently stated that he turned down a two-year deal in the summer worth more than £300m a year from a Saudi club.“I would love to see Ronaldo play in the Saudi league,” said Prince Abdulaziz. “It would benefit the league, the sports eco-system in Saudi and will inspire the youth for the future. He’s a role model to a lot of kids and has a big fanbase in Saudi.”Ronaldo scored in Portugal’s 3-2 win over Ghana at the Qatar World Cup on Thursday and Saudi may make its own bid to host the tournament. “Who wouldn’t want to host the World Cup?” the prince said. “Any country in the world would love to host the World Cup.”In hosting major sporting events including boxing world title fights Saudi has been accused of sportwashing to deflect criticism of its record on human rights. But Prince Abdulaziz claimed doing so has been positive for his nation’s people.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“The numbers don’t lie – when you look at participation in boxing, from six gyms in 2018 to 57 gyms today. A 300% participation increase, 60% are women, which was a shock for us. When you see appetite from the youth, men and women, they learned from it. If it’s making the country better and fixing a lot of the social issues we have in terms of participation then that’s a benefit for us,” he said."
51,Marcus Rashford rediscovers the joy of football after tough times,The Guardian,Paul MacInnes,2022-11-30T20:00:25Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/30/marcus-rashford-rediscovers-the-joy-of-football-after-tough-times,"Manchester United forward is smiling again at the World Cup after racist abuse, loss of form and being dropped by EnglandAt half-time on Tuesday night, England had a problem. They were in control of their World Cup Group B fixture against Wales but had not scored. For momentum, for the fans, for keeping critics in the media and online at bay, something needed to change. And so, five minutes after the restart, Marcus Rashford stepped up and smashed a free-kick into the top corner from 25 yards.The Manchester United forward followed up with the final goal in the 3-0 victory. Taking a long pass on the run, he chopped inside the Welsh left-back Connor Roberts, beat him definitively with a stepover, then drove the ball between the legs of the goalkeeper Danny Ward. It was an exhilarating, exuberant moment and, as he turned towards the crowd and his teammates, Rashford flashed his famous smile. England now face Senegal in the last 16 on Sunday.Rashford is a problem solver, just ask Boris Johnson. But he has had more to work out over the past year than at any time in his meteoric career. In the summer of 2021 and struggling with injury, he put off dealing with a shoulder problem so he could take part in the European Championship. That tournament was a great success for the country, but intensely challenging for Rashford. Used exclusively as a substitute, he failed to make an impact on the field and when he was brought on during the final against Italy for the express purposes of taking a penalty, he missed and England lost.What followed was a shameful moment for the country. Rashford, and fellow England internationals Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho, became the targets of racist abuse. A mural of Rashford in Withington, Greater Manchester, was defaced. Some more coded criticism also came his way: the suggestion that Rashford should concentrate on football and forget social justice and his campaigning for free school meals and childhood literacy.No one knows the toll that period took on Rashford the person, and it was not the first time he had had to deal with racist abuse, but the worst season of his career as a player then followed. At club level for Manchester United he struggled. Taking time to recover from that shoulder injury he also languished in the shadow of the legend and legendary ego, Cristiano Ronaldo. Six months ago Rashford was dropped from the England squad. At the time, Gareth Southgate described the decision as “straightforward”.Today, fans need only use the evidence of their eyes to see how much has changed. Rashford has no doubt benefited from a change of coach at Old Trafford, the Dutchman Eric ten Hag having assured the player of his belief in him and his ability. Goals have returned to Rashford’s game, 10 so far in all competitions this season, but, crucially, so has the flair. On top of all his myriad personal qualities, Rashford is an exceptionally gifted footballer and has the ability to do things with the ball, at pace, that few others can, even in the Premier League.This has been manifest in Qatar, where Rashford has three goals, up there with Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi in the battle for the Golden Boot. His first goal in the tournament, against Iran, came just 49 seconds after he had come on as a substitute – he sent a defender to the floor with a clever feint before passing under the keeper.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballAfter the Wales match Southgate spoke frankly about the recovery of a player he has always supported, even when choosing to leave him out of his team. “It’s been a challenge for him,” Southgate said. “I went and saw him in the summer, had a long chat with him, and he had some clear ideas he felt he needed to think about and do.“You can see with his club there has been happiness in his performances this year, and that has shown itself on the training ground with us. We have a different version completely to the player we had in the Euros last summer. It’s great for him, and because it’s great for him it’s great for us.”Rashford dedicated his free-kick goal to the memory of his friend, Garfield Hayward, who had died just days before. “He’s had quite a long battle with cancer, so I’m pleased I managed to score for him”, he said. “He’s always been a big supporter of mine. He was just a great person and I’m pleased he came into my life, really.”The way Rashford articulated publicly news he had kept private from the England squad was another reminder of his ability to confront positively the difficult moments in his life. From growing up in Wythenshawe on free school meals, the child of a single mother with three jobs, to confronting the UK government and, now, rediscovering the joy of playing the game that has transformed his life in ways he might not always have asked for, Rashford has always been faced by problems. But he has also remained dedicated to working out the answers."
52,The changing face of the Socceroos: how football holds a mirror to Australia | Mostafa Rachwani,The Guardian,Mostafa Rachwani,2022-11-15T14:00:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/16/the-changing-face-of-the-socceroos-how-football-holds-a-mirror-to-australia,"The history of the national team is the history of Australian migration, and Graham Arnold’s 2022 World Cup squad is no exceptionIn many ways, football and migration have always been intertwined in Australia. From its introduction by British migrants in the late 19th century and the rise of postwar ethnic clubs, to the dismissiveness of the phrase “wog-ball” and the jubilation of the 2006 squad filled with first and second generation migrants, football and migrant communities have been inseparable bedfellows.It is a link that remains just as strong today, with the Socceroos squad announced for the 2022 World Cup featuring players from Bosnian, Croatian, Turkish-Cypriot and South African backgrounds. And in a trio of players with South Sudanese backgrounds – Awer Mabil, Garang Kuol and Thomas Deng – the Socceroos have a new generation of diaspora players to reflect both changing face of the squad and of the country.Their inclusion by coach Graham Arnold reflects both their rise to prominence – Kuol, for example, recently secured a move to Premier League side Newcastle United – and the increased diversity of the playing pool at youth level.Considering the latest census results show almost half of Australians have a parent born overseas – and just under a third are born overseas themselves – it would be inaccurate to call the squad diverse. They are, and always have been, a mirror reflection of Australia.This group of players reflects the realities of the ethnic makeup of Australia better than competing sporting codes, politics and the media. It is a point driven home by Craig Foster, the former Socceroos captain and current human rights activist, who says it is far from surprising to see varying communities represented in the squad.“The Australian male national team has reflected the changing face of the country for 100 years. And if you go through all of the different iterations and decades, and for World Cup squads, you see the face of Australia’s immigration,” he tells Guardian Australia. “Today, we now see our new African-Australian diaspora start to be reflected through the team, and it’s wonderful to see.”Asked why Australian football is so deeply intertwined with migration, Foster takes a moment, reflecting on communities who came to Australia with “football in their heart”.“Of all of the sports that Australia’s immigrant communities most love, overwhelmingly, the majority of them come from football loving countries,” he says. “When the majority of immigrants come to Australia and settle into life, one of their great passions they want to bring to life is to be involved, or to form their own clubs, in association football. It’s the world’s biggest sport.“Australia, and Australian football, is better for its diversity.”It is a belief shared by many in the football landscape, particularly at youth levels, where coaches see the frontline of change. Craig Carley, a senior coach at Goulburn Valley Suns Football Club and a previous coach of Kuol, says he has witnessed the face of football changing, and he believes it will only lead to a better Socceroos squad.“I can certainly see a shift – football is changing, it’s becoming more diverse,” Carley says. “And I think it’s just brilliant for the sport. What we see locally is only going to benefit everyone, certainly the Socceroos as well. With the shift, it creates a wider pool of players, and these players are starting to be recognised for their talent. It’s amazing and inspiring for other young players.”Carley believes the process that has diversified the Socceroos – of players from migrant backgrounds climbing the ranks through the youth systems – would only lead to an improved squad. But he adds that there is a key prohibitive factor: the cost of youth football, particularly if a player reaches higher levels such as the National Premier League, Australia’s second tier. “I think Australia would be ranked a lot higher in the world if they gave more diverse players opportunities,” he says. “It’s been a massive challenge, and I have no doubt whatsoever that it has impacted the national team selection. We should have a far more diverse team, and I think in years to come, the team will change.“I think this issue has been completely detrimental to the senior team – there is just so much talent that’s been missed because players can’t go to training or games, can’t get the right gear, and won’t get the right opportunities.”The frustration at costs as an impediment to development is a common one, particularly for coaches like Carley who see the potential directly. Paul Giordano, secretary of the Azzurri Sports Club and Adelaide Blue Eagles, where Deng started his playing career, says he has seen lots of talent go to waste.“People pay a lot of money to play this sport, which, especially for new immigrants to this country who want to play the sport, becomes prohibitive,” Giordano says. “The problem isn’t getting them to the top, it’s getting them in at the bottom.“Once you’re identified as a good player, people recognise that and they’re willing to help. But it’s that initial step. If you turn around and say, well, you can play junior squad, but the fees are $900 or $1,200, or $1,500, that initial step might just be too much. People can’t afford that.”Sign up to The RecapThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionDespite these challenges, the game is still changing at a rapid pace, and Giordano has seen it happen up close. He has seen his club and many others around Australia have to change their names and “de-ethnicise”. He remembers when, in 1996, Soccer Australia ordered clubs to “remove all symbols of European nationalism from club logos, playing strips, club flags, stadium names, and letterheads”.David Hill, the Soccer Australia boss at the time, said it was to “Australianise” the struggling National Soccer League, an idea that still stings today.“It was like trying to erase our history, and I know our club amongst many were very upset by the situation, that you had to denounce the name of your club. That’s how we became the Blue Eagles,” Giordano says. “Like with anything, we want our history acknowledged.”The decision was made in an attempt to broaden the reach of football, to access “mainstream” Australians, bearing an underlying assumption that the migrant communities who built up football were not part of “mainstream” Australia.To Giordano, any success in Australian football is always owed to some degree to migrant communities, particularly the postwar wave of migrants from southern and eastern Europe who formed the bedrock of footballing infrastructure in Australia.They’re the Greek, Bosnian, Italian, Macedonian, Croatian and Serbian communities who blazed the trail for other diasporas, who then set the stage and cemented the connection between the Socceroos and migrant communities.But they have not been without their controversies, most recently at this year’s Australia Cup final, when some fans of Sydney United 58 FC, an old NSL club, chanted songs with fascist links, booed during the Welcome To Country and performed Nazi salutes.It is an incident that reflects the ongoing tensions between “old football” and “new football”, and the long journey ahead to mend a footballing culture still somewhat in two minds about what it wants to be and how to acknowledge its cultural roots. It makes the Socceroos the stitching between these eras, cultures and communities, the common ground that everyone unites around every four years.To Francis Awaritefe, former Socceroos player and chair of the players’ union, Professional Footballers Australia, the game of football itself is a uniting force.“When you look at the game of football, especially in these very febrile times, with all the divisive rhetoric around, I think football is very well positioned as a sport to really bring people together and unite people,” Awaritefe says. “I’m so proud to see the face of the game changing. It’s part of the DNA of football to be egalitarian, diverse and inclusive.”But Awaritefe warns that it is important to avoid complacency, and says football’s diversity could become a “weakness” if “we don’t look after it, and we don’t nurture those values”.“Respect, and respect for human rights has to always be central. We’ve seen how racism can grip other codes, how Indigenous or migrant players are treated in other sports. So it’s really important that we don’t allow ourselves to become complacent around the diversity of the game, so that we can continue to nurture it, because it is a massive strength. It’s in the DNA of the sport.”"

For the legions of photographers capturing the tournament, timing, position and a bit of luck are all key to scoring a winning frame.""You've only got seconds to capture what could be an iconic moment. And you're just hoping for the shot,"" says Charlotte Wilson.The 29-year-old is in Qatar, and her pictures have been picked up by news outlets around the world.But you're not always in the right place at the right time, as she found out during Japan's win against Spain.The surprise victory took them into the knockout stages and booted out Germany - but the question remains: Did it cross the line? Germany out on dramatic night.Charlotte calls it ""one of the biggest pictures of the tournament"", but on this occasion she wasn't able to capture it.""It's always quite gut-wrenching when something big happens at the other end,"" she says.""Capturing those images can be really difficult. Sometimes you've got to be lucky in your position, but have the skill in being able to take the picture and compose it well,"" she tells BBC Newsbeat. But even though she wasn't able to get the shot of the much-debated moment, Charlotte quickly turned her lens on the celebrations and stadium screen confirming the goal.Charlotte, from Hertfordshire, says her highlights of covering the tournament so far are ""all the upsets"", including Saudi Arabia beating Argentina.She will be at the England v Senegal game and thinks it'll be lively for both her and the fans.""With all the nerves and excitement, it's very much take as many pictures as you can and hope you don't miss something,"" she says.The days can get quite long, Charlotte says, especially when the morning games are on.She can find her day starting at 9am and finishing at midnight.A typical day for Charlotte includes getting to the ground around three hours before.""You have to print off your match ticket. Then you sit, shoot the game and do some fan photos as well.""It's a unique World Cup, because usually you can manage one game a day and then you're travelling and then you do another game.""But this one, we've been able to do two games a day so we're getting to see a lot of football compared to usual.""Charlotte says all tournaments are different and Qatar is no exception.""It feels like a strange time of coming out of the Premier League and normal league football, straight into a World Cup.""My experience has been pretty good, everything's run really smoothly.""The people working here are just so polite. You've got to stick to the rules that are given, but I haven't really experienced any issues."" With the first all-female officiating team taking charge earlier in the week, Charlotte is seeing a change with more women involved in the game.""It's nice to see a different range. And I think people would agree it hasn't affected the quality.""She says photography has been male-dominated, but in the eight years she's been doing it ""there's been an increase in female photographers coming through"".And she hopes the fans continue to be as brilliant for the cameras as they have been so far.

54,"Just like the hat, football’s grip could suddenly go out of fashion after Qatar | Jonathan Wilson",The Guardian,Jonathan Wilson,2022-11-12T20:00:50Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/nov/12/just-like-the-hat-footballs-grip-could-suddenly-go-out-of-fashion-after-qatar,"Football – facing fans’ disgust at this World Cup – should beware a plummeting status in the face of a critical mass of frustrationLook at a photograph of the crowd at the 1923 FA Cup final and pretty much everybody is wearing a hat. Fast-forward a quarter of a century and a rough estimate would be that a little under half the crowd at the 1948 final are similarly clad. Go forward another 25 years to 1973 and although Bob Stokoe, the Sunderland manager, topped off his tracksuit-and-mac look with a trilby, almost nobody in the stands at Wembley has their head covered.In the unlikely event that anybody at the first Wembley Cup final gave the matter any thought, it is doubtful they would have believed bare-headedness would become the norm. And yet over the course of half a century, men stopped wearing hats. Things change, often unexpectedly, and aspects of life we take for granted can drift away, almost unnoticed.Football today, as David Goldblatt argues in The Age of Football, is the most universal cultural mode there has ever been, consumed avidly across the globe. It is everywhere, a badge of identity, a tool of dictators, our universal entertainment. But could there be a future in which that supremacy wanes?This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.The Real Madrid president, Florentino Pérez, keeps telling us that football is losing ground among the young but, given his assertion comes amid his advocacy for a European Super League and his reluctance to release whatever data demonstrates his claim, it’s hard to know how much credence it merits.What is clear is that, across the pyramid, more people watch football now in the UK than ever before, that television rights deals have never been higher and that, even if Fifa’s claim that 3.572 billion people watched the last World Cup final is obvious nonsense, it was the sort of number that could be bettered only by a presidential assassination, a global charity concert or a human walking on Mars. But nothing lasts for ever and, as we approach a World Cup so morally questionable that some are refusing to watch, it is worth asking what it would take for football to lose its dominant position.Most cultural modes fade because of technology. Music hall and theatre yielded to radio and cinema, which yielded to television, which may now be in the process of yielding to streaming platforms. Newspapers quake before the internet. Even the hat declined with mass car ownership as people spent less time outside.Yet technology has, by and large, only enhanced the grip of football on the global culture. First radio and then TV have spread it throughout nations and then the world. The expansion has not been without consequence: the fear until the 90s was that broadcasting games would lower attendances at grounds. Absurd as that may seem in the context of the modern Premier League, it has proved apt in many other countries where the preference is to watch the big European leagues on TV rather than attend matches.Social media has ensured the conversation about football goes on, the banality, offensiveness or delusion of much of the discourse less relevant than its volume. Perhaps Pérez is right and the younger generation are all too distracted by TikTok and Fortnite to bother watching Real Madrid hammer Real Mallorca or Elche but, without seeing his evidence, it doesn’t feel like that.But sometimes phenomena do just lose popularity. Discussing Elon Musk’s troubled takeover of Twitter, the tech strategist Gareth Edwards outlined his theory of the “trust thermocline”. A thermocline is the narrow transition layer in a body of water between the surface, where waves keep the temperature relatively warm, and the much cooler water below. It is where the temperature suddenly plummets.Edwards’s theory is that a social media company, say, can tick along, making money, riding out small increases in cost or diminutions of service until suddenly a critical mass of frustration is reached and users desert the platform, after which it’s almost impossible to restore trust – not least because users have migrated elsewhere. “The greater the role emotional engagement plays in the product,” he explains, “the bigger the risk of a catastrophic loss of trust.”Hats, having been essential to keeping warm, became largely decorative and so their symbolic significance became more apparent, particularly to a generation whose wartime service had made them resentful of the status they conferred. It becomes far easier to reject those tokens of rank when your head’s not cold and lots of other people are also rejecting them.Could something similar happen to football? Consider this World Cup. There is disgust at Fifa’s corruption, at the sense of greed, at the perception of the game being used as propaganda.If the football is poor (and given issues of fatigue and lack of preparation time that is a clear possibility) and the experience on the ground – the expense, the absence of games from local television, the lack of recreational options in a city crowded with visitors, intrusive policing – no fun, might that temper enthusiasm for attending tournaments? Could a lack of atmosphere, drabness on and off the pitch, then lower TV audiences and thus broadcast revenues?Perhaps, although it seems a long way off. But then if Conmebol nations are, as has been suggested, admitted to the Uefa Nations League in 2024, there would be a clear alternative to the World Cup, a space to migrate to.In the club game, the case the European Super League three have brought against Uefa under competition law represents a potential risk. If Uefa’s position is found to be a monopoly, could there be a splintering into multiple jurisdictions akin to boxing? Then there would not only be spaces for fans to migrate to, but a dilution of the product – and however dubious the way the modern Champions League distributes wealth and enriches the already wealthy, the product itself in its latter stages is of undeniably exceptional quality.Any threat to football feels improbable, but that’s the nature of thermoclines: when the temperature drops it does so abruptly. The current hegemony should not be taken for granted. Football remains extraordinarily popular but this World Cup may test that. And no cultural mode can afford to ignore the fact that men do, sometimes, stop wearing hats."
55,Brendan Rodgers an ideal upgrade for England if Southgate walks away,The Guardian,Ewan Murray,2022-12-12T17:03:22Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/12/brendan-rodgers-an-ideal-upgrade-for-england-if-gareth-southgate-walks-away,"Leicester manager could be the missing ingredient needed to take the Three Lions to the next level and win a major trophyBrendan Rodgers has an uncanny knack of being in the right place at the right time. As Gareth Southgate ponders and the Football Association plans, Rodgers is the most viable alternative. Southgate acolytes will not like the sentiment, but he would be an upgrade.In May 2016, seven months after being jettisoned by Liverpool, Rodgers was the ideal man to reboot Celtic after the stagnation overseen by Ronny Deila. Thousands greeted Rodgers upon his arrival. Rodgers ticked off “the Celtic thing” – not everybody gets that chance – with rose petals tossed at his feet while rediscovering his managerial mojo away from the competitive ferocity of the Premier League. Plenty will shrug at achievements in Scotland but the undeniable fact is Rodgers raised standards and positively altered the careers of umpteen players. Rodgers was great for Celtic and Celtic was great for Rodgers.The Rodgers plan always involved a return to England’s top flight. Again, things slotted into place as Leicester came calling. Rodgers had grown frustrated at Celtic – the feeling of unease was mutual – and the appeal of a free-spending club was obvious. Jousting for a Champions League berth and the historic claiming of the FA Cup justified Rodgers’ switch. Leicester’s prominence – Tottenham and Arsenal finished the 2020-21 season behind them – further emphasised the sense of a managerial career reborn after a bruising conclusion to his Anfield tenure.There was trauma in the early stages of this campaign having been informed of necessary and drastic cost-cutting over the summer. Rodgers looked a certainty for the sack with a run of one win in 10 league matches. But, as a once blissful marriage looked to be hurtling towards grim divorce, Rodgers rallied. Leicester entered the World Cup break with four wins out of five and in the relative comfort of 13th place.This, however, is not the movie the Northern Irishman signed up for. He regards himself as a top-bracket coach. His aspirations are at the summit of the game. Leicester can no longer fulfil his needs. Should Southgate decide six years is long enough in the England furnace, football fate as well as expertise point squarely towards Rodgers. In admittedly a thin field, there is one outstanding candidate. Right place, right time, once more for Rodgers.He can be the consummate politician. This is a training-ground manager who has controlled big clubs and bigger egos. His man-management and game understanding are top class. International football is now the most tactical domain in the sport.Sceptics will argue the evidence of Liverpool, Celtic and Leicester implies players grow tired of the Rodgers message but that need not be entirely relevant for a squad that meets a handful of times in any given year. A more pertinent criticism relates to routinely poor performance in European competition. That, Rodgers could insist, came without anything like the array of talent an England manager can call upon. Rodgers has a level of self-belief that would cascade through the team and could prove their missing ingredient.Perhaps the most compelling point is that Rodgers could see this as his best chance to scale the mountain again. Leicester look bound for mid-table obscurity. He has managed Liverpool, which rules out a future at Old Trafford. Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham do not look like option at present and although Arsenal once were, Mikel Arteta is safe at the Emirates. Rodgers could move abroad and invite the associated risk or manage England under the perfectly salient theory that he could perform better than Southgate. Lost in the World Cup melee is that England were relegated from the top tier of the Nations League after being reduced to a quivering mess by Hungary.There is an absurd, parochial obsession in some quarters with the appointment of an Englishman. But this is a football manager, not the leader of a St George’s Day gala. The successful candidate must simply comprehend the environment; something anybody who has extensive experience in the Premier League will readily do. Winning trumps all else when in charge of an international team, including by way of positive impact further down the chain. In any case, it is a blunt reality there are not nearly enough English coaches of elite standing.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballSouthgate is able to determine his own future, which is fair enough given the esteem those at FA board level hold him. Unlike previous incumbents, Southgate has never given his paymasters cause for tabloid front page concern. He is the safest of safe hands, a thoroughly decent man in a febrile world.This is something of a conundrum for all involved. Although Southgate has elevated England – semi-final, final, quarter-final – this is a country that has chronically underperformed for decades. Southgate has not presided over anything exceptional. At £5m per year, this is a job that handsomely rewards the meeting of reasonable targets. The 52-year-old must also be aware of a rising sense that he is squandering outstanding resource.England have vanished down the golden generation rabbit hole before. The hype is just that – it arrogantly ignores excellent players available to other countries – but will lead to increased pressure should England not crush all before them. Their Euro 2024 qualifying section, which includes Italy, Ukraine and North Macedonia, is negotiable but not a given. A split looks useful, including for those of us intrigued by the level Southgate would reappear at. He has injected doubt into debate about his own future, which is telling.When Rodgers next appears in public he will inevitably sing Southgate’s praises and dispute change would be in the best interests of the England setup. He may even regard international management as a non-viable option at the tender age of 49. But there could well be an imminent scenario which serves huge purpose to Rodgers and the FA; neither should spurn it."
56,England hope coach’s knowhow can shackle Kylian Mbappé | Jacob Steinberg,The Guardian,Jacob Steinberg in Doha,2022-12-06T22:37:23Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/06/england-steve-holland-assistant-coach-mbappe-france-world-cup-quarter-final,"Gareth Southgate’s assistant has a history of working out ways to nullify the world’s best playersAs trepidation grows over the thought of Harry Maguire and John Stones trying to stop Kylian Mbappé when England face France on Saturday night, Gareth Southgate can take comfort from the knowledge his right-hand man dealt with this kind of situation when Chelsea won the Champions League in 2012.Steve Holland’s experience is a reminder that any player, even the most devastating forward at the World Cup, can be contained if the tactical approach is good enough. Southgate’s assistant was on the backroom staff at Chelsea when they became European champions 10 years ago and he remains proud of how Roberto Di Matteo’s unfancied side stopped a peak Lionel Messi from scoring when they reached the final of the Champions League at the expense of Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona.“There are a handful of players you need to consider special attention to,” Holland says. “Messi has been one and probably still is. You’d have to put Mbappé in that kind of category. We need to look at trying to avoid leaving ourselves in situations where he is as devastating as we’ve all seen.”This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.Holland believes the tie with France is a 50-50 game. He knows the world champions have forwards who can score a goal in the blink of an eye. He will remember, too, that there was an element of luck involved when Chelsea beat Barça given that Messi, who was just as terrifying as Mbappé is now, missed a penalty in the second leg.England need to strike the right balance. Holland, who has worked for José Mourinho and Antonio Conte at club level, is fascinating on the tactical challenges posed by Mbappé. Do England have to be cautious? Or are they bold enough to try to force him back?“I remember having a conversation with Mourinho when he was with Real Madrid,” Holland says. “[Dani] Alves would be the right-back for Barcelona and flying forwards in attack. He would play a soldier against him to try to stop him, but then you don’t get any threat from your team from the soldier. You’re just stopping somebody. You’re not actually hurting them. Then he would try to play [Cristiano] Ronaldo one against one because Alves was fantastic going forwards but maybe not quite as good defensively as a consequence.“There is a plus and a minus to every one. It’s that cat and mouse of: ‘Yes, we have got to try to deal with him, but we also have to try to exploit the weakness that his super-strength delivers.’ Trying to adapt your team to cover for that while still trying to create your own problems is the challenge.“I would like to think we won’t just be looking to stop a player. We would be looking to try to do everything possible to limit his super-strength while still trying to focus on our own strengths because we have good players; players just as likely to cause France trouble as Mbappé would be to us. We have to find that balance.”The obvious question, then, is whether England keep faith with their 4-3-3 and back Kyle Walker to stop Mbappé flying down the left. Or is this the moment to switch to a back five, protect Stones and Maguire by moving Walker to right centre-back and start Kieran Trippier at right wing-back?“The perception has been that the five is more negative than the four, which I don’t completely agree with,” says Holland, who explains why England used a five against Germany and Italy at Euro 2020. “Germany played 3-4-3 and we felt that if we matched them up we could be superior individually.”But was it necessary when England met Italy in the final? “You could go either way. They had and still have a similar way of playing where they create five players high in attack. If you’ve got four at the back, you get overloaded at times and that can cause a tactical problem, so that was part of the rationale in that game.“We have a group 18 months further on than the Euros. One or two of our younger forwards, there has definitely been an evolution. To win tournaments you need to be the best team in both penalty areas.”Holland thinks about England’s win over Iran in their opening game in Qatar. “Six goals is a good start but two goals a game against is not going to win us the World Cup. We’ve now had three clean sheets, which is clear progress.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“We have goals from different players. We have three, four, five attacking players where there is very little between them. There isn’t a right or wrong team. It’s not just a case of a back three or a back four, it’s trying to utilise what we’ve got to give ourselves the best chance of scoring as many goals as possible and conceding as few.”Inevitably, the conversation turns to Jude Bellingham, England’s sensational 19-year-old midfielder. “He’s unique,” Holland says. “We’ve talked about Messi and those special techniques. What makes the top, top ones is the mentality, the ambition every day to push and be competitive. There were a few at Chelsea I felt were always there in training.”Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and John Terry come to mind. “There were others,” Holland says. “Players that weren’t super-gifted physically or super-gifted technically, but the mental aspect of it took them to a different level of performance. Jude has those mental attributes. There has been an evolution physically in the last 12 months. It has taken him to another level.”Holland considers Bellingham’s experience at Borussia Dortmund. “The Bundesliga is a good league to develop in. It’s probably not quite as challenging every week as the Premier League. He gets a fair share of games where he is comfortable and enjoying playing on the ball and not always on the limit, which for a young player is a good way to develop. His impact in this tournament, for a player of his age, is already hugely unusual.“I’m always balanced, as Gareth is, with the amount of praise because we have seen so many where so much goes wrong because they believe in their publicity. I don’t think that will happen with Jude.”Holland is happy Bellingham is adding goals to his game. It is something for France to think about as England put the finishing touches to their plan. “There’s only three things that you can do in football,” Holland says. “Stop goals, make goals, score goals. That’s how you contribute.”"
57,Toney admits disappointment at World Cup snub after sinking Manchester City,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson at the Etihad Stadium,2022-11-12T17:24:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/12/manchester-city-couldnt-handle-brentfords-toney-admits-pep-guardiola,"Pep Guardiola admitted Manchester City failed to control Ivan Toney, whose two goals gave Brentford victory over the champions less than 48 hours after he missed the cut for Gareth Southgate’s England World Cup squad.City’s reverse was a first in the Premier League at home since February, ending a 20-match run, and leaves Guardiola’s side in second place on 32 points before the break for Qatar.“The better team won – Toney’s exceptional for them,” he said. “We had a lot of problems. We could not make a high press because they did not allow us – long balls from the keeper to the striker and in this process we could not win any balls because when Toney flicks the ball on he creates problems.“He’s very good, he’s able to win [duels] with all the central defenders, we were not able to control this aspect. Every time a centre-back jumped they suffer.”Toney, who has 10 league goals this season, was asked about missing out on the World Cup. “It’s disappointing but, listen, I know what I’m capable of and I won’t let it put me down. I just keep going and keep doing well for Brentford.”The 26-year-old insisted Southgate’s decision had not affected his approach to the game. “The motivation is the boys in the dressing room and the fans, as you can see,” he said.A delighted Thomas Frank said: “He should have scored five goals – he had five good chances: one in [the] first half, then he scored then he missed one from angle, scored a goal and then missed the last one. Honestly, what a player.“Gareth picked the squad he believes in but I hope he thinks about Ivan if there is an injury. He proved it today against the best team in the world. Of course him and I both think he should be there but we’re looking from our side and Gareth from the other side and we don’t know who’s right.“Ivan has a very good family around him. I’ve known him for so long, I have no doubt he’ll come back stronger. I showed my empathy [to him].”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballFrank described Brentford’s win as the best in their history. “Maybe this is the single best result. It’s massive. For the fans, I’m so happy we’ve created another unbelievably magic moment for them. The dressing room were fantastic scenes.“We are the bus stop in Hounslow [as Bees fans sing] against the best team in the world.”"
58,Denmark v Tunisia: World Cup 2022 – live,The Guardian,John Brewin,2022-11-22T11:34:51Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/nov/22/denmark-v-tunisia-world-cup-2022-live-score-updates,"Tunisia survived a very late VAR call, as the referee stuck by his guns to take a deserved point off a disappointing DenmarkHe’s dynamic, he’s dazzling, he’s our Denmark specialist and Nick Ames was in the Education City Stadium to see that rather exciting 0-0 draw. Peter Steele writes in: “Re: Bogdan’s observation. Worth noting the Europeans are still unbeaten. Saudi, Tunisia and Ecuador all looked good. But Iran, Qatar and Argentina have all looked pretty poor. Senegal were OK with a Mané shaped hole up front.”We had *only* eight minutes added on in this match. Fergie-time has become Fifa-time. The reason, Fifa has confirmed, is down to a new directive to ensure that all “unnatural lost time” is added on at the end of each half. In Qatar it has asked officials to more accurately monitor when a game is stopped for goal celebrations, time wasting, video assistant referee decisions, substitutions, penalties and red cards – even if it means extending a match by many minutes.As we await the match report, some armband news. Germany’s pre-match presser just got a tick more interesting after BILD broke the news that the DFB are looking into suing FIFA re the armband.Flick and Kimmich will likely have to face more than just questions about the game tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/ra8NtKRkbnBogdan Kotarlic gets in touch: “Saudi Arabia won earlier today, Tunisia held out for a draw against a very good Danish team, it seems to me that the non-European teams playing here in Qatar have improved in the last few years? Or maybe it is the case of few good performances and later these teams will be well beaten by the Europeans?”On that non-penalty, from my esteemed colleague Philip Cornwall: “I think the no penalty call was not because of the handball, but because of a Denmark playing shoving a Tunisian beforehand. That’s why it restarted with a Tunisia free-kick. Jensen shoves someone over with an arm in the back. The No 11, before the ball comes in: Taha Khenissi. Why else restart with a Tunisia free-kick?”On ITV, rentaref Peter Walton is rattling on about it not being a handball. He’ll probably change his opinion later to suit events, as is his way.A result that will not resound as globally as Saudi Arabia beating Argentina but Tunisia celebrated that with gusto. They deserved their point, giving their all, and not without danger on the attack. Denmark lacked a cutting edge and were put off their stride, they were also denied a penalty late on, a couple, in fact. Instead, VAR’s screen of doom was shown short shrift by the Mexican referee, and Tunisia got the point they deserve. That lived up to the description of an entertaining goalless draw.90+8 min: Yeah, he’s dragging this one out but more clumsiness from Cornelius results in a Tunisia free-kick. Surely that’s it, and it is. A famous draw, a point well won by Tunisia. 90+6 min: Tunisia clinging on now, this would be a famous, and deserved, point, they will have at least one more corner to come. Eriksen will take, and the Tunisian keeper claims. Well done, him. 90+4 min: Hang on…what’s this? VAR called into action. The handball that took place ages ago is seen on screen, a penalty looks likely, and then the ref goes to the screen and waves it away. Told you he was no fan of VAR. Unprecedented scenes. César Arturo Ramos, for it is he, you old renegade, you.90+2 min: Getting scrappy now, and Dahmen slides to try and prevent a corner, but can’t do it. Cornelius had got the ball stuck under his feet. There’s an appeal for handball from the Danes. Again, no VAR called in. 90 min: Laidouni got hugs from all the Tunisia staff, for one hell of a shift. Only five minutes added on. Fifa robbing us of bonus soccer when there’s been a load of subs this half, is it?88 min: Chance for a break as Damsgaard gets the ball but Cornelius is cumbersome and knocked over. Tunisia make another chance., two of them. Drager and Laidouni, who has looked tired since his solo run, go off, and Sassi and Kechrida off.86 min: Booking for Khenissi, who wallops into Jensen. 84 min: Hannibal takes ball and man – Maehle – out at the touchline. There is nothing doing but that one looked close. The referee, who doesn’t seem to like VAR much, shows utter disinterest. 83 min: Jensen has to hurry the ball back to Schmeichel as Hannibal gives chase. 80 min: Big cheers from the Tunisian fans – feels like the home fans – for a double substitution. Off go the two older strikers in Jebali and Msakani, for Hannibal, and Taha Yassine Khenissi.79 min: Tunisia look tired, and so do Denmark. And there’s probably 20 minutes to play yet if the referee follows the Fifa doctrine. 77 min: Cornelius and the high ball seems to be the new tactic for Denmark. If it can work for Kieffer Moore and Wales then why not? Jensen is booked for a foul on a speeding Sliti. 75 min: Cornelius holds up the ball down a channel but can’t find a colleague. Jensen ducks and weaves but then can’t get his shot on target. Hannibal, the Manchester United kid, may be imminent soon. The Tunisian crowd seems to hope so. 73 min: Kasper Hjulmand looks annoyed on the bench. This has been a decent match but must be frustrating to be involved in. 71 min: Tunisia want a penalty, the ball came off the naturally positioned hand of Andersen. He was close so no penalty. VAR did not have a look, the ref waved it away. Lengthy protests. A replay of the Cornelius incident: he had to score…but didn’t.70 min: The corner causes chaos, Christensen heads across and the ball is heading over the line, it just needs Cornelius to tap in, and he fails to do so.69 min: Those changes are taking a while to percolate, the game a bit shapeless, and Eriksen, coming into the middle, gets the chance to shoot from the edge of the box. Dahmen makes a fine save. 67 min: Tunisia sub: Slimane off, and Naïm Sliti comes on. 65 min: Here it comes. Kjaer off, and he hands the armband to Jensen of Brentford. Cardiff legend Cornelius on, for Dolberg. Lindstrom, a Europa League winner with Eintracht, on for Skov Olsen. And with it comes a rejig, perhaps three at the back and a flooding of defence.63 min: It appears a triple Denmark change is in the offing. 61 min: Ball headed behind for a Denmark corner. Eriksen skids the ball at Andersen but Tunisia clear. 59 min: Tunisia aren’t done, and they try and mount an attack, their fans roaring every pass. The rarely spotted “Olé” at 0-0. 57 min: Maehle shows his skill, making space for Damsgaard to whip in the ball from the flank. Dahmen in the Tunisia goal flaps, and it’s beginning to look like Denmark can see a way through. Dolberg’s flick was there for the taking but Skov Olsen fails to read the ball’s flight. 55 min: Denmark get the ball in the net after a lengthy ricochet session, Skov Olsen slots in, but there’s an offside on the play.54 min: Yann Dury is back with that Forest contingent in full(ish): Squad players:- Bren Johnson (Wales)- Neco Williams (Wales)- Wayne Hennessey (Wales)- Freuler (Switzerland)- Kouyate (Senegal)Loaned players:- Laryea (Toronto / Canada)- Drager (Dunno / Tunisia)- Aguilera (Dunno / Not that one / Costa Rica)- Hwang Ui-jo (Olymiakos / South Korea)- Horvath (Luton / USA!!)53 min: Bronn, the centre-back, has a shot, and deflected behind. What a wall of noise. Slimane’s corner is cleared. 51 min: Damsgaard is on the field to add extra creativity and ball-carrying, but he is surrounded by Tunisian defenders, whose line is held. And then the ball breaks for Laidouni, who is away, but not confident in himself, or his own energy. Then Draeger smashes over. Laidouni is bent double in exhaustion after that run. Not even the energy of the crowd can stop him feeling fatigued. 49 min: The Tunisian defence remains strong, and it feels like something special is going to be required. 47 min: Denmark immediately concede a corner, as Tunisia go again at the B of the Bang. It’s cleared but the time when Denmark must pick off their opponents draws closer. At the moment, they are still being swarmed all over.46 min: And we’re back…can the Tunisians keep it up? Some emails. Kári Tulinius: “I’m surprised how lacking in imagination the Danes have been. A team of that quality shouldn’t be sending speculative crosses in from deep in the first half. I imagine Jalel Kadri must be pretty happy with the way the match is going.”Gregory Phillips: “All the focus on the players backing down has made us momentarily forget the point, I think, which is that FIFA is the villain here. Infantino is a joke, except he isn’t funny. Not intentionally, anyway, and even the unintentionally farcical nature of his “management” of this event is hard to laugh at given how many people have suffered. Sorry, I might just be annoyed that someone just scheduled a meeting with me during Mexico-Poland. What is wrong with people?”Yann Dury: “Five from the PL squad and a further five who are out on loan. Five of them were on team sheets yesterday (for three teams in two of the matches).”Name them…Have some half-time Squires. That’s been a decent half, full of Tunisian energy, and Denmark frustrated. It took a Kasper Schmeichel save to keep it level at the break. The Danes will feel the bruises, and be deafened by the noise from the North African fans. 45+4 min: We get some added time, of course. But that’s it for the first half. 45+3 min: Denmark have a free-kick in a decent, inside-right position, Eriksen territory. It zips in, and Meriah, one of the Tunisian towers, heads behind. 45+1 min: We had just four minutes added on, which feels like a tournament low. Delaney is being iced up on the sidelines. 45 min: Jembali shoves over Andersen, and somehow escapes a booking. It looks like Thomas Delaney will be going off. His day is done, and on comes Mikkel Damsgaard, of Brentford, though who hasn’t made much of an impact in west London just yet. Delaney looked to be holding his hamstring. Uh oh. 43 min: So close! Looked like the one. Jembali was through, and Schmeichel, in a one-on-one, somehow smothers a ball heading for goal. That reminded very much of his father’s starfish...it was a brilliant save, genetics in action.41 min: Hjoberg wants a penalty for a foul from, yes, Laidouni. No dice. Thomas Delaney meanwhile has a problem. And gets slowly to his feet.39 min: Slimane takes a corner for Tunisia, after plenty of jostling, and it falls to that man Laidouni, who sees glory and crashes it just wide. He’s been excellent, the Ferencvaros player. Here’s our profile from our interactive. The warrior in Tunisia’s midfield. Laïdouni embodies Tunisian “grinta” – grit and determination. A combative box-to-box runner, formidable in the tackle, he arrives in Qatar tipped to be his nation’s breakout star this winter. It is clear that his days in Hungary are numbered, with major European clubs tracking his progress. He has spoken previously of his ambition to make the step up: “I really like England and Germany. These are really two championships that make me excited … I just have to give the best of myself in each match: I always try to move forward. But there are no givens in football. That’s why you should never stop working, surpassing yourself. That’s my focus: I have to continue this momentum.”37 min: Laidouni, who has been the player of the game so far, attempts to thread a pass through. Tunisia have been close on a couple of occasions when looking to supply the final ball. 35 min: Denmark now dominating possession. Tunisia coiling ever backwards. "
59,‘Still here’: a Welsh World Cup odyssey sets seal on emotional awakening,The Guardian,Donald McRae | Photographs by Tom Jenkins,2022-11-19T08:00:54Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/wales-world-cup-qatar-emotional-awakening,"From the composer and singer of the team’s rousing song to the country’s most-capped footballer, we gather voices that matter before Qatar trip“Dafydd Iwan!” a man with a big belly shouts at the bottom of a hill which overlooks Caernarfon Castle and offers views of the Menai Strait, Anglesey and the mountains of Snowdonia. Iwan, the 79-year-old composer, turns and smiles. There is a long pause as he is also a politician, a preacher and now the unofficial leader of the Red Wall of football supporters who will follow Wales at their first World Cup in 64 years.Eventually the man just lifts his hand and, in dazed surprise, says: “Yma o Hyd.”Iwan waves back and repeats the title of a song he wrote almost 40 years ago, a paean to Welsh defiance and nationalism which has become an emotional World Cup anthem. Yma o Hyd means “still here” in English and it is sung in a way which says that, despite persecution and suffering, the Welsh remain as proud as ever. “I can’t escape it,” Iwan says as the wind howls in Caernarfon. “When they can’t think of anything else they say: ‘Yma o Hyd!’”It reminds me of the Red Wall joining Iwan in a booming chorus of the song before Wales beat Austria in a World Cup playoff semi-final in March. Tears ran down Iwan’s face as he sang Yma o Hyd with wonder at the way the Welsh language and a vibrant national identity were celebrated by a choir of 33,000. He returned to sing again in June before Wales beat Ukraine to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1958.Iwan was imprisoned four times in the 1970s for his activism on behalf of the Welsh language – a fact not lost on Chris Gunter, the most-capped male Welsh footballer in history, who told me how he added Yma o Hyd to the team playlist years ago. After beating Ukraine, Gunter called for Iwan to join the players on the pitch.Gunter, who has left AFC Wimbledon in League Two to join the Welsh squad in Qatar, explains how Wales were ranked 125th in the world and below the Faroe Islands as recently as 2010. Tim Hartley, the author and Wales fan, watched the national team away from home long before then. Against Azerbaijan in 2002, Hartley was one of only 58 hardy Welsh souls who made the arduous journey.Hartley (above) who sings Yma o Hyd before every home game of his beloved Cardiff City, as his club also play Iwan’s song, will be in Qatar. “God can strike me down five minutes after the kick-off [of the first group game] against the USA,” he says, “because I’ll have realised a lifetime’s ambition.”A match at Pentre where the manager who took Wales to the 1958 World Cup, Jimmy Murphy, grew up; A red ballon floats over the goalposts that were inserted into the ground at Ynys Park more than 50 years ago by local miners. Nobody has been able to move them since; The home fans watch Ton Pentre attack as they take on Merthyr Saints in a South Wales Alliance League match.The Ton Pentre players in the dressing room after their 7-0 win over Merthyr Saints; The blue plaque on the wall of a house in Treharne Street, Pentre where Jimmy Murphy lived.Yet Hartley’s joy is curbed by disdain for the choice of Qatar as tournament host. “Do I feel conflicted? Yes. Do I wish it were somewhere else? Absolutely.”Iwan will be in Qatar, too, with the same tangled pride and disquiet. But before we reach his home in the village of Caeathro, I remind Iwan how the actor Michael Sheen quoted his song when a rollicking homage to Wales on a television gameshow went viral.A League of Their Own does not usually feature poetic words but Sheen lit up the screen as he fused Iwan’s song with resurgent belief in Welsh football. “Yma o Hyd, Yma o Hyd,” Sheen whispered as he closed his eyes and spread his arms:I hear the voices singing, speed your journey, bois, bois bachOne nation, singing with one voiceA song of hope, a song of courageA victory song that floats through the valleys like a red mistRolls over the mountain tops like crimson thunder.A red storm is coming to the gates of QatarIt crackles with the spirit of ’58 and Jimmy Murphy’s boys.Sheen built to a crescendo, reaching catharsis with England, the troublesome neighbours from back home whom Wales will play in their final group game on 29 November:When the English come knocking on our doorLet’s give ’em some sugar, boys, let’s give ’em some Welsh sugar!They’ve always said we’re too small, we’re too slow, we’re too weak, too full of fear.But Yma o Hyd, you sons of Speed,And they fall around us, we’re still here!In his front room, Iwan suggests “the idea you’ve survived echoes the Welsh way of thinking we’ve had a hard time or we’re hard done by. It’s a song of defiance and survival, of the Welsh language and people.”The big screen at Cardiff City Stadium displays the words to Yma o Hyd, along with the English translation, as Wales fans sing after the win over Ukraine.Iwan wrote the song in 1983 when “it was a terrible time and the Thatcher regime hit Wales heavily. Coal mines and steelworks were closed and I was in the middle of a terrible divorce. Ymo o Hyd is about how we’re still here, despite everything and everyone and even ourselves. But it’s lovely that all these years later the song is driven by the Red Wall. It has become the focal point and Ian Gwyn Hughes has worked on this diligently for he believed that, to get the Welsh team giving their all, they needed a broader view of Welshness.”Hughes, the head of PR at the Welsh FA, asked Iwan to sing before the World Cup qualifiers. He says Yma o Hyd is “a political song, in Welsh, but it has a rousing tune the fans love. It has been quite a journey for Wales, politically, the last 40 years. From the miners’ strike to devolution so much has changed and we now have a renaissance with people wanting to learn Welsh. We’re also trying to reflect that, in football, it’s been a journey. There have been bad defeats and near misses but in the last [seven] years we’ve qualified for three major tournaments. Yma o Hyd and football go hand-in-hand.”For Iwan there was still “an element of doubt it would work when I sang before those games. But when 30,000 people sing along at the top of their voices, and in good tune, it struck me like a thunderbolt. God, I was crying. And against Ukraine I felt like a rock star because the crowd were even better.”Yma o Hyd is very different to a tired old reprise of Sweet Caroline or a sentimental chorus of “football’s coming home”. Instead, Iwan and the Red Wall singing in compelling union is the sound of a new Welsh confidence in its identity and language. Hartley suggests that only 20% of the population are fluent in Welsh – but around the national team the desire to speak the language, and sing in it, is consuming and inspiring.“After the game Chris Gunter called me down to join the players in front of a sign which said Diolch i’r Wal Goch [Thank you to the Red Wall],” says Iwan. “To have the team behind me singing their hearts out was brilliant and then Gareth Bale carried one of his children and, still singing, we walked to each other to shake hands. We were full of joy.”Dafydd Iwan singing Yma o Hyd along with the victorious Wales squad after the World Cup playoff final match between Wales and Ukraine.Hughes remembers another galáctico being swept away when Wales played Poland in their final home game before the World Cup. “That night I focused on Robert Lewandowski,” he says, “and after the [Welsh] anthem he just looked up at the crowd and said: ‘Wow…wow!’”Red Wall fervour did not exist the last time Wales made the World Cup. “There’s a story about Terry Medwin who played in 1958,” Hughes says wryly. “When he came back with his suitcase someone said: ‘Been away, Terry?’ He said: ‘Yes, I played in the World Cup.’ There was not much coverage. One Wales World Cup match report in the South Wales Echo was 10 paragraphs long. There was more on the selection of the Welsh swimming team.”Wales’s manager Robert Page, pictured below, comes from Tylorstown in the Rhondda valley – 25 miles from Cardiff. It remains an impoverished area but, in a sign of the inclusivity permeating from the national team, Page announced his World Cup squad last week in the Tylorstown Miners’ Welfare Hall. It is a fitting coincidence that Page grew up three miles from Murphy’s home in Pentre. Murphy managed the 1958 team which reached the quarter-finals and lost only 1-0 to Brazil – with the goal scored by a teenage sensation called Pelé.Fifty eight years passed before Wales played in another major football tournament. They shocked everyone, including themselves, by reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2016. Even more than beating Belgium in the quarter-final, Hartley suggests: “We’ll never top that feeling in Bordeaux before the first group match [a 2-1 defeat of Slovakia]. Years ago we’d sit in an Indian restaurant after watching Cardiff City and play this game. Cardiff in the Premier League or Wales in an international final? Wales. Cardiff to win the FA Cup, or Wales win the Euros? Wales. We never thought we’d make it so Euro 2016 was like your best party and it lasted three weeks. We had arrived. It had all been worth it.”Instructing the Red Army to keep their chins up after a narrow loss to England, and entertaining everyone with his parents’ dilemma of whether to watch the semi-final or attend his brother’s wedding in Mexico, Gunter represented the Welsh heartbeat in 2016. He still does in 2022, even if at 33 he does not play many games. After remembering how his parents chose Wales over the wedding, Gunter reassures me there will be no clash of dates in Qatar.Gunter, with 109 caps, is a valuable witness to the dark days Wales endured in the first half of his international career which began in 2007. “In the bad times,” he says, “we played Luxembourg in Llanelli [in 2010] and there were only 4,500 [fans].”Chris Gunter, who plays for AFC Wimbledon in League Two, won the first of his 109 caps for Wales in 2007.For Gunter and his best friend Aaron Ramsey, the lowest moment occurred with the death of Gary Speed in 2011. Hughes left the BBC, where he had spent decades commentating on Wales games, to join the FAW in 2010. Speed soon took over as manager and in his short tenure he transformed expectations and standards. Hughes says: “Gary brought discipline and commanded such respect. He had a real presence even though he had no ego.”Whenever Gunter hears the clip of Sheen exalting “you sons of Speed” he feels raw emotion. “That line touches us because Gary was a giant. His fingerprints are still on Welsh football.”Chris Coleman did an admirable job replacing Speed. His empathy carried the squad through those bleak times even if Coleman was in charge when Gunter remembers their nadir in 2012. “We had a real bad 6-1 defeat in Serbia. A major tournament seemed a million miles away.”Hughes grimaces. “The FAW were trying to market the team in a new way and we had this strapline: Time to Believe. After that game it was: Time to Forget.”Hartley, a long-suffering 62-year-old fan, remembers all the defeats. “We used to sing: ‘We’ll nev-er quali-fy, we’ll never qual-ify …’ Some would say those trips were a fantastic holiday ruined by 90 minutes of football. Now, with this new success, football’s gone mainstream. I know people I’ve travelled with for years who feel a bit aggrieved. They say: ‘Who are these Johnny-come-latelys?’ But I think it’s great and Welsh football is now very special. When the crowds go away, I’ll have the team back all to myself.”Hartley laughs but he is a key figure in ensuring that the ferocious enmity between Cardiff and Swansea fans, which once scarred away trips, has been set aside. Rival supporters reject their club colours to unite as one with Wales.Cardiff and Swansea fans during their Championship match in October. The two sets of supporters are bitter rivals but have united behind the national team.Gunter, meanwhile, picks out an unexpected game that began the transformation in tiny Andorra in September 2014. Andorra led 1-0 to wailing from the Red Wall. Then after Bale equalised in a Euro 2016 qualifier, his 89th minute free-kick changed Welsh football for ever. It was blocked but, when the referee ordered it to be retaken, Bale curled in a trademark beauty.“Knowing what we know now, that could be the most important goal Wales and Gareth have scored,” Gunter suggests. “It was the opening qualifying game but we struggled on the 3G pitch. If we hadn’t won I think the fans would have given up on us because we had Belgium and Bosnia in our group. Then Gaz scored in the last minute and it carried on from there all the way to the Euro semi-finals.”In September 2017, Wales won a World Cup qualifier 2-0 in Moldova and two of Iwan’s four sons travelled as supporters. Iwan recalls: “One of them called me after the game and said: ‘I’m in a club in Moldova and all the fans and the players are singing your song. I’m standing next to Aaron Ramsey who is singing Yma o Hyd like nothing you’ve seen before.’”Over tea and scones at home, Iwan remembers some of the violent prisoners with whom he had shared a prison cell after defacing public signs written only in English in the 70s.“An especially frightening man was very big, erratic and he’d assaulted somebody. He asked: ‘What are you in for?’ It was nonpayment of fines. When I explained I could pay the fine but decided not to for the cause of the Welsh language he thought it was bonkers. It’s different now. So many non-Welsh speakers have recently told me the language belongs to all of us.”He smiles when I say that scary prisoner might be telling people now that he once shared a cell with Dafydd Iwan. Late afternoon darkness stretches across north Wales but, as we step outside, the bumper sticker of Cofiwch Dryweryn gleams on Iwan’s car. Those Welsh words mean Remember Tryweryn.The following morning we stop alongside the Tryweryn valley which was flooded and turned into a reservoir in order to supply water to Liverpool in 1965. The entire village of Capel Celyn was lost after its residents were forced to abandon their homes for the benefit of an English city. Remnants of the flooded village still jut above the water. They are another reminder of why beating England is always a delicious prospect for the people of Wales.The phrase ‘Cofiwch Dryweryn’ – which translates to Remember Tryweryn – has become a prominent political slogan for Welsh nationalism, and is graffitied on a stone wall near Llanrhystud, Ceredigion. It originates from the decision by Liverpool city council to flood the Tryweryn Valley, including the community of Capel Celyn, to create the Llyn Celyn reservoir which supplies water to Liverpool.Ten minutes from Tryweryn, Bala Town are currently third in the Cymru Premier League and, in the words of their chairman, Nigel Ackroyd, they resemble the national team in “punching miles above our weight. The population of Bala is less than 2,000. We’re the Premier League minnows. But for the last 20 years, since [Bala’s manager] Colin Caton joined we’ve been on a road of success. We were three tiers below the Premier League then but we’ve been here for 12 years. We’ve won the Welsh Cup, finished second four times in the Premier and played Europa League games.”The achievements under Ackroyd and Caton, who were born in England, are shown by the thriving academy and nine Bala FC teams who play on a 3G pitch which cost £500,000. That investment allows football to be played every day at Bala’s little ground at Maes Tegid. In previous rain-sodden winters they were lucky to play once every five weeks.Bala Town players come out of the home changing room for the start of their fixture against Pen-y-bont in the Cymru Premier League on the 3G pitch at the Maes Tegid ground in Bala; Colin Caton, the long-serving manager of Bala Town; A sign all in Welsh in Bala High Street advertising the Bala Town v Pen-y-bont match; An advert for the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru at the ground; Local boys watch the home team attack.During Euro 2016 the town rebranded itself as Bale. World Cup fever is now building in Bala, especially in the Spirit of 58 shop, where Tim Williams sells the bucket hats and shirts adopted by the Red Wall. Williams will travel to Qatar and, showing us a pair of Gunter’s old boots, he praises the full-back: “Chris epitomises the spirit of this fantastic team.”Gunter played alongside Dave Edwards who was capped 43 times for Wales. The 36-year-old Edwards now leads Bala against Penybont in a Cymru Premier League game on a rainy Saturday afternoon. As always Bala walk out to Yma o Hyd.“Bala is in a very Welsh-speaking area,” Ackroyd says. “So it made sense to start playing Yma o Hyd once we reached the Cymru Premier League. Dafydd Iwan once lived in Llanuwchllyn [near Bala] and it’s a very spiritual song full of emotion for all people in Wales – or Cymru as we say here.”The FAW plans to call Wales by its Welsh name of Cymru in future internationals. It is another sign of Welsh pride and, watching Bala and Penybont in a fiercely competitive 1-1 draw, it’s hard to shake Yma o Hyd from my head. I remember the last story Iwan had told me the previous afternoon.“One summer day I heard a car screeching to a halt with a bang. I ran down the road and the car was on its side. Five boys clambered out and one of them had blood running from his head. I said: ‘Wyt ti’n iawn?’ Are you OK?’ He was in a daze and then, recognising me, said: ‘Yma o Hyd.’ They were still here.”Tim Williams, the owner of The Spirit of 58, a Welsh football fan shop in Bala High Street. He is pictured holding a replica World Cup and one of his famous bucket hats.After a long wait of 64 years Wales are not only still here but on their way to the World Cup. Hartley’s bliss, however, is compromised:“My life has been building towards this but if I were true to myself I wouldn’t be going because of Qatar’s human rights record and treatment of gay people, women and migrant workers. I will be there but I’ll think about Kevin Davies, my groundhopping friend and former trade unionist, who says: ‘I cannot come with you, Tim.’ I will think about Hayley Evans, who runs Wal Goch y Menywod, the women’s Red Wall, and says: ‘I cannot come with you, Tim, because of the way women are treated in Qatar.’ But it’s something I’ve got to do.”Like Tim Hartley and Hayley Evans, passionate Wales fans Steve Ward (above right) and son Steffan are split over travelling to Qatar. Steve is flying out to follow Wales but Steffan is staying home and hosting parties in the garage which they converted into a bar and shrine to Welsh football during Covid lockdown.Iwan, Hughes and Gunter will feel the same bittersweet emotion in Qatar. The Wales team, and the travelling Red Wall, will listen to Yma o Hyd and Sheen’s speech again and again as they draw courage for their tangled adventure. As Gunter says with a grin: “When my English friends hear [Iwan and Sheen] they say: ‘I wish I could be Welsh.”Hartley echoes this view: “I’m hoping people choose Wales as their second team. We’re the underdogs, always have been. We’re not threatening. You could say that’s a political weakness or a cultural strength but we’re strong enough in our own skins to support Wales aloud and proud. We’re not aggressive or xenophobic. We’re just happy being Welsh.”Wales’s official World Cup video carries a harder edge. Yma o Hyd is played throughout footage which splices together iconic Welsh football moments with archive film of Iwan and other activists being arrested in the 70s. Images of the miners’ strike bleed into Sheen exalting “You sons of Speed” and Iwan crying as he sings with the Red Wall.The final words come from an exultant football commentary in Welsh, when qualification for Qatar was sealed, and the video ends with an image of Iwan’s head filling the screen.Back home in Caeathro, and not long before he flies to Qatar, Iwan says: “It’s a politically charged video. There are clips of our language demonstrations and police clashing with miners, and a shot of me coming out of prison to meet my wife and my eldest son as a baby. The Welsh FA could have diluted it to a nice little song – but they got it. They understood the song.”Iwan, a lovely old grandfather who has become a symbol for modern Wales and the cherished dream of Welsh World Cup football, sinks back into his chair. He then says those three little words which matter more than ever in Wales: “Yma o Hyd”."
60,World Cup 2022: why do footballers take the knee? - Reuters,Reuters,,2022-11-21T17:01:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/world-cup-2022-why-do-footballers-take-knee-2022-11-21/,"[1/4] Soccer Football - FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 - Group B - England v Iran - Khalifa International Stadium, Doha, Qatar - November 21, 2022 England's Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice take the knee before the match REUTERS/Hannah MckayNov 30 (Reuters) - England's players have taken the knee before all their matches in the group stage of the Qatar World Cup. Here is a look at the history of the anti-racism gesture in sport:Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, then a player of National Football League (NFL) side San Francisco 49ers, declined to stand for the U.S. national anthem before a pre-season match in 2016 and knelt in another game, setting off a debate about race relations, policing and the mixing of politics and sports.Kaepernick was later joined in kneeling during pre-match renditions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" by many NFL players to call attention to what they saw as a pattern of racism in the treatment of African-Americans by U.S. police.Kaepernick became a free agent after that season and has not been signed by another team since. His activism was seen by some as a reason why teams were wary of signing him.The protests also drew the ire of then U.S. President Donald Trump, who called for the NFL to ban players who kneel during the anthem.The Black Lives Matter cause was taken up by Premier League clubs in 2020 after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.England's top-flight clubs wore the Black Lives Matter logo on their shirts before it was replaced by ""No Room for Racism"".England's men's and women's teams have knelt before games since 2020, initially in solidarity with protests over Floyd's death and then in support of equality.Athletes in other sports have lent support for the movement, most notably Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka at the 2020 U.S. Open where she wore a mask with the name of a different Black American victim of police brutality before her matches.Osaka, who has a Japanese mother and Haitian father, went on to win the title and was lauded for her activism.Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, the lone Black driver in Formula One, has also been a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement with anti-racism gestures before races.Critics of the protest, including conservative politicians, say it politicises sport and that they dislike the gesture's links to the organised element of Black Lives Matter, which some consider a far-left movement.A YouGov poll published in June last year found that 54% of supporters in England backed players ""taking the knee"" with 39% opposed.England manager Gareth Southgate has been supportive and participating in the gesture on the sidelines, saying that black players need to feel solidarity after a bombardment of abuse online and at some matches.He said his players had ""made our stand as a team"" after they were booed by Hungary fans when taking the knee before their friendly in Budapest last year. England took the knee during the European Championship last year.Premier League teams decided to limit taking the knee to only some significant games from the 2022-23 season.England were joined by Wales in taking the knee before the two teams faced off in their final Group B encounter on Nov. 29. It was the first time at the tournament that Wales made the gesture.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.As the World Cup reaches a climax in Qatar, drama on the pitch has partially eclipsed human rights controversies that dogged the Gulf Arab state since it was first chosen to host the competition 12 years ago.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

61,‘My dream collapsed’: the World Cup 2022 injured XI who will miss Qatar,The Guardian,Andy Hunter,2022-11-16T20:00:28Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/16/world-cup-injured-xi-reece-james-paul-pogba-timo-werner,"Reece James, Paul Pogba and Timo Werner are among the big names who will sit out Qatar 2022. Here is our starting lineup …Ghana arrive at the World Cup as the lowest-ranked team in the competition and with an acute goalkeeping crisis on their hands. Their first choice, Charlton’s Wollacott, was a late omission after suffering a finger injury in the warm-up to Saturday’s League One game at Burton. With Richard Ofori, the second choice, also sidelined, the head coach, Otto Addo, has been forced to draft in three inexperienced keepers to the squad.The Chelsea defender described himself as “devastated” after failing to convince Gareth Southgate that he was a risk worth taking. James was ruled out for eight weeks after damaging knee ligaments against Milan in October and underwent a gruelling rehabilitation programme in an attempt to be fit. He did not succeed, and is arguably England’s biggest loss.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.The Atlanta United defender played a key role in the qualifying campaign, building on his success at the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup when he scored the winner in the final against Mexico, only to rupture his left achilles tendon against Chicago Fire in May. The 25-year-old underwent surgery and is not expected to return until next year.The French Football Federation hailed “the honesty of Presnel” after the Paris Saint-Germain defender informed Didier Deschamps on Monday that he did not feel sufficiently recovered from a hamstring injury to help the team’s title defence. The 27-year-old was one of the few French World Cup-winners to maintain his level at last summer’s European Championship. His place has been taken by the uncapped Monaco defender Axel Disasi.Southgate has gone from having a feast of right-backs to a famine on the left after the hamstring injury that Chilwell sustained against Dinamo Zagreb earlier this month increased his reliance on Luke Shaw staying fit and in-form during the tournament. Chilwell did not make an appearance for England at Euro 2020 but was showing signs of returning to form following an ACL injury when his latest setback occurred.Pogba certainly lived up to the hype at the last World Cup when, unrecognisable from his Manchester United days, the midfielder was instrumental in France’s triumph on and off the pitch. There will be no repeat four years on, however. The 29-year-old has not featured for Juventus since returning to the club in the summer having undergone surgery to repair a torn meniscus suffered in pre-season. He then damaged a thigh muscle in training.Didier Deschamps will be without both of the central midfielders who started France’s World Cup final win over Croatia four years ago as Kanté is sidelined by a hamstring injury. The 31-year-old suffered the problem in August before joining Chelsea’s list of World Cup absentees when relapsing, and going under the knife, in October. None of the six midfielders in Deschamps’ squad were involved in Russia.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballTottenham fans may not have witnessed the best of Lo Celso but he has been an important part of Lionel Scaloni’s plans in recent seasons and is a big miss for Argentina in Qatar. The on-loan Villarreal midfielder suffered a muscle tear against Athletic Bilbao last month and is expected to need surgery. Scaloni said Lo Celso was “irreplaceable”.The luckless Borussia Dortmund favourite has been here several times before. When the 33-year-old was taken off on a stretcher with a serious ankle injury during September’s derby against Schalke there was despair and resignation around Signal Iduna Park. Reus missed Germany’s victorious 2014 World Cup campaign with an ankle injury, missed Euro 2016 with a groin problem, played in the poor World Cup defence of 2018 and missed Euro 2020 with fatigue. The derby injury makes it four tournament absences out of five.“One of my dreams collapsed,” posted the Liverpool forward after a calf injury sustained in the closing minutes of October’s win against Manchester City shattered his World Cup ambitions. Jota had not long returned to the Liverpool side after a hamstring problem and is unlikely to be fit when the Premier League season resumes on Boxing Day. His absence, along with that of Wolves’ Pedro Neto, leaves Portugal more reliant than usual on Cristiano Ronaldo.Playing more regularly in order to secure a place at the World Cup was one of the reasons Werner returned to RB Leipzig from Chelsea in the summer. The striker made an encouraging start, with nine goals in all competitions, only for an ankle ligament injury sustained the week before Hansi Flick announced his squad to derail those best-laid plans. Werder Bremen’s in-form Niclas Füllkrug has been called up instead."
62,Fans can celebrate Glazers’ sale of Manchester United as ownership tide turns | Barney Ronay,The Guardian,Barney Ronay,2022-11-23T20:00:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/23/fans-can-celebrate-glazers-sale-of-manchester-united-as-ownership-tide-turns,"It is hard not to conclude that this – and Liverpool being up for sale – is related to failure of the European Super LeagueHow can you sell something you never actually paid for? How is it possible to make profit without risk or jeopardy, or indeed any sign of expertise along the way? What is this miracle commodity, this blend of metal, plastic, turf and other people’s monetised joy?Welcome to football capitalism 101 and the metaphysical puzzle of the Glazer ownership of Manchester United. No wonder they call leveraged buy-outs the beautiful game. It is, in the end, one you just can’t lose.More to the point, what does it mean when not one but two members of English football’s US billionaires’ club announce they have decided to cut and run, the Glazers midway through a Gulf‑powered World Cup that has, just because it can, cut a hole in the decadent old European club season?For now, most United supporters will have only one response to the news that the club is, probably, possibly up for sale. That response is unfettered celebration, and rightly so. It will be tempting at this point to say things like: be careful what you wish for, beware what lies beneath, there are no clean hands here, and all the rest. This is undoubtedly true. Newcastle supporters, for example, are currently required to wrestle with the contradictions of being “given back their club” by generous and competent owners; who wish, simultaneously, to use that precious entity as an amplifier for a repressive regime, something that sounds like giving back, but also like taking away.Just wait until Bahrain gets wind of this, or the Mongol empire (Manchester thanks you, Genghis) or General Zod of the Krypton military command. For now such contortions can wait. In the meantime, why not kick back and enjoy the moment. Because whatever lies in store, at least it won’t be this.How to summarise the Glazer era? Firstly, it’s not an era. Eras contain events, structure and achievements. This has been something else, a kind of staged congealment, with the sense of an object being expertly hollowed out from the inside.The Glazers have been terrible football club owners. At the same time they have been very good at being terrible owners. Expertly parasitical, beautifully slick at turning Manchester United into an Avanti trains kind of club: something fundamentally shabby and grudging, all cut corners, blocked toilets, skeleton staff, the natural monopoly on their fans’ footballing loyalties stretched thin for a quick buck.There have been three broad stages to this. The first was the late-Ferguson plateau, when momentum and managerial will allowed the ship to keep drifting forward. This was followed by the post-Ferguson chaos, during which the club spent (other people’s) money incoherently, appointed pliant placemen to key roles, and still rinsed the brand for all it’s worth with genuine skill and care.The last year has seen a third stage, a panicked attempt to rescue a little gloss, with money spent in a rush and the disastrous celebrity-influencer partnership with Cristiano Ronaldo.Through this, the dominant note of Glazer-ism has been that branded emptiness, part haunted medieval hall, in thrall to its own ghosts, part celebrity waxwork museum, a grand old club reduced to something resembling a market stall sale of remaindered Gary Pallister dolls (may have been damaged in transit). It is entirely natural United would want to move on from that version of itself. Whatever comes next will be different. Sometimes you just want to feel something again.Sign up to The RecapThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionAlthough what happens next will, as ever, be dictated by larger tides. Because something does seem to be happening here, and it’s not just a Manchester story. The usual suspects will enter the takeover chat. An ambitious nation-state. A consortium headed by a showy US billionaire. Jim Ratcliffe, who sounds acceptable because he’s called Jim and is a genuine home-loving Englishman from Monaco.The wider note in this story, a little overlooked to now, is the fact Liverpool are also up for sale. Is this starting to seem strange yet? Are the rabbits rustling in the treeline? The two most valuable privately owned properties in English football are put up for sale within a month of one another. The key US billionaires, boarding group one, are cashing out simultaneously. This is significant enough as a standalone event. But there are no coincidences. And as ever, always follow the money.It is hard not to conclude that this is related to the failure of the Super League. The prospect of fresh growth under that model was clearly a major part of the strategy. Many people think it will still happen in some form, but perhaps not in that same blunt and brutal way the Glazers and Fenway Sports Group had aggressively championed.It does also feel oddly poignant that this should emerge during the Qatar World Cup. The split in European club football’s power-players has on one side loosely aligned, the nation-state clubs (Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, Chelsea for two decades, Newcastle United for the next two) driven by political and soft power aims; and on the other clubs owned by private bodies interested in making a profit, along with others under some more bespoke form of ownership, chiefly Bayern Munich and the Spanish clásico clubs.The real driver behind the ESL was the prospect of capping the power of nation-state clubs, of finding a way to compete with an entity that has no commercial jeopardy, where simply keeping up – and most football clubs are horribly reckless – means killing yourself. Its collapse, and the likely departures of FSG and the Glazers, are all signs that the nation-state clubs are winning this. The cartel is, frankly, in disarray. Barcelona have sold their future in return for a wonky version of the present. Juventus Ronaldo’d themselves in search of an illusory next level.What does it leave? The arrival of Todd Boehly at Chelsea is evidence US investors and their partners still see major potential for growth here, that football’s value will simply continue to rise. And yet, somehow, watching Boehly it is hard to shake a slight sense of doubt. Are we through the good billionaires? Is Boehly the Liz Truss of the Premier League ownership party, the sediment at the bottom of the barrel, the comedy endgame? Does this really feel like a convincing version of the future, fit to push Abu Dhabi and Qatar?It is still a rising tide out there, a product that is relentlessly in demand. And with the old guard on their way out this leaves seven Premier League clubs with US owners or investors. Perhaps the future is a more dynamic form of entrepreneurial growth, the kind of stuff Boehly has been sketching out: tuning the details, introducing new gimmickry, even another great pivot.The identity of the new owners at Old Trafford and Anfield will tell us a great deal about Premier League ownership 3.0. But it is already hard to avoid two conclusions. First that this is still all within the blast radius of the Super League, collateral to that failed coup. And second, that what the Glazers will leave behind is something desiccated and emptied out, another host body for football’s own vampiric late capitalism.With no rules around countries and their investment funds owning clubs, or on how private investors can pillage these assets, the hunt for ‘good owners’ will continue. For now the market will decide. For United fans there is perhaps consolation in the simple fact that, at the very least, it won’t be this."

We have weapons too but we are going to have to be vigilant and we cannot make the mistakes that we made against Denmark when it was a corner or free-kick because they can be very dangerous.“I think it will be a very open match. I think they have the same characteristics as us. They have some very fast players on the wing and full-backs that get forward. We are both quite similar, two teams who know how to move forward very fast on the pitch.”The France defender Ibrahima Konaté pointedly said that “football isn’t played by one or two players, it is played by the whole team”. Mbappé has scored five goals in Qatar and is a strong contender for the Golden Boot.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“We are not dependent on him,” Rabiot said. “He has amazing potential and we know that 90% of the goals can maybe come from him. He is very fast, able to make great assists but we also have other players who can make a difference on the pitch in another way. We have a great weapon in Kylian and we’re not going to deprive ourselves of that.”The England right-back Kyle Walker, who is likely to be given the task of nullifying Mbappé, said he does not intend to “roll out the red carpet” for the in-form Paris Saint-Germain forward. Konaté said his Liverpool clubmate and opponent on Saturday Trent Alexander-Arnold has been ribbing him since they were pitted against England. “Trent sent me some teasing texts,” Konaté said with a smile.The France centre-back added that just as England would be foolish to obsess about Mbappé, Didier Deschamps’ side have no plans to focus on Harry Kane, who took his England tally to 52 goals in their last-16 triumph over Senegal, one short of Wayne Rooney’s England goalscoring record. “We’re not going to target one particular player,” Konaté said. “I’ve played against him a few times but everybody knows Harry Kane is a very good player, a very English player.”Konaté, who was born in Paris to immigrants from Mali, was asked about Morocco becoming the first African team to progress to the World Cup quarter-finals since Ghana in 2010. “It has been amazing to see the African countries impress the world with their performances,” Konaté said. “I’m really happy to know that Morocco are through to the quarter-finals. I am focusing on France because that is the country I have chosen to play for but I hope Morocco do well.”Rabiot, who had a short spell with Manchester City as a 13-year-old, came close to joining Manchester United earlier this year and said he maintains ambitions of playing in the Premier League. “I really liked the atmosphere [in England],” the Juventus midfielder said. “It’s really something that’s only in England – it’s different to France and Italy. I’ve always said that I’d like to play in England and I still have that desire. I would like to evolve in the Premier League.”"

I don't think you need to do it so much at the game... We also have to respect the rules and continue to work, so we'll put pressure on ourselves to entertain from the football pitch.""Ramsdale, 24, said Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford being given the number one shirt was a ""fair"" decision but added he will do all he can to be ready to play if called upon by manager Gareth Southgate.Pickford has been Southgate's first-choice since the 2018 World Cup and started every game at last year's Euro 2020, while his deputy Nick Pope is more experienced than Ramsdale at international level.Ramsdale was a late inclusion in England's Euro squad but did not feature at the tournament, and earned his World Cup call-up after impressive performances for Premier League leaders Arsenal.""It's fair. I see as it is. Jordan Pickford has done extremely well for England and he is fine form for Everton. And so is Nick Pope with Newcastle (United). I'm not the only one racking up the clean sheets,"" Ramsdale said.""We've got a great bond between the goalkeeping group... You need all three of us to train properly to get the number one to his best. We're all training like number one at the minute, and it will be difficult for two of us to try and flip the switch and help out.""Whoever gets that first game will have full support from the group. You never know with tournament football, anything can happen and you just have to be ready if called upon.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.As the World Cup reaches a climax in Qatar, drama on the pitch has partially eclipsed human rights controversies that dogged the Gulf Arab state since it was first chosen to host the competition 12 years ago.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

66,I interviewed Beth Mead and this is what happened – and what matters,The Guardian,Donald McRae,2022-11-16T11:00:19Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/16/beth-mead-interview-what-happened-arsenal-diversity-womens-football-england,"Arsenal striker was not unfairly treated but let the focus now switch to increasing diversity in English women’s footballLast Friday night, after England’s consistently impressive women’s football team beat Japan 4-0, Ian Wright and Eni Aluko cut to the heart of a different story about a lack of diversity in the game. “It’s a systemic problem and we are just dealing with it in incidents,” Wright said when asked to comment on my interview with Beth Mead in the Guardian last week.Aluko, once an outstanding England international like Wright, and now the sporting director of Angel City in the American National Women’s Soccer League, agreed. “It’s not a Beth problem,” she said. “It is a systemic problem.”This key distinction was lost on social media because Mead had been subjected to unacceptable abuse. One question, which needed to be asked, had turned the issue into “a Mead problem”. It has since become another “incident” that obscures systemic racism in the development of women’s football.I don’t think either Mead or I handled this small but crucial part of an otherwise positive interview correctly. Towards the end of our allocated slot I mentioned to Mead that, in contrast to the England men’s team, her squad consisted of mainly white women. “Is there an obvious explanation why or is it just coincidental?” I asked. That loaded word “coincidental” was a clumsy way of asking whether there could be any alternative reason to systemic racism.Mead said: “I think it’s completely coincidental. We put out our best 11 and you don’t think of anyone’s race or anything like that. I think that’s more an outsider’s perspective.”After the interview was published online last Tuesday, Mead asked Arsenal to contact me to see whether I would be willing to add some “context”. I agreed and carried the full text that Arsenal supplied to me, which they and Mead produced together: “Mead believes more should be done to ensure football is accessible for everyone at grassroots level to ensure diversity at all levels. But she insists she doesn’t think there is concern in regard to racism in elite women’s football.”So I was surprised that, on the same Friday night when Wright and Aluko spoke so thoughtfully, Mead took a different tack in an interview with Sky Sports. After the game against Japan, she complained that she had made additional comments relating to diversity in our interview that had not been included. This is simply untrue – a fact accepted by everyone who has heard the recording. It is also not helpful to Mead or to the wider conversations we need about the lack of diversity in some areas of women’s football.“I think it was unfair how it was written,” she told Sky. “My values and beliefs are completely different to how it was written. It’s not a true reflection of me as a person. In terms of diversity and everything in the game I want to be there, front and centre, and helping with that. I know the FA are doing a lot for that and I actually said that in the interview. That didn’t get put through on the interview. So unfortunately it made me look worse in that context but, yeah, unfortunately these things happen in the media these days … sometimes, don’t believe everything you read.”Mead’s allegations against me obviously matter far less than troubling questions of racism in sport. But it feels right to add some background. In terms of “fairness” I actually should have pressed Mead further. As the Times reported last weekend: “There were only three mixed-heritage players in the England squad which won Euro 2022, and it is estimated that the proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic players in the Women’s Super League is between 10-15% – compared with about 33% in the Premier League.”As the audio of our interview shows I um-ed and ah-ed aloud during a long pause after Mead’s answer. In those few seconds I was in the midst of deciding whether to ask further questions on race and football during such a tough personal time for Mead and her family. In the end I chose not to grill Mead on the issue because it felt as if others in positions of power need to be asked harder questions – rather than a young woman still reeling a little from a tumultuous year of glory and worry.Mead agreed to our interview as a way of publicising her new book. We spoke about many subjects and Mead addressed her past insecurities honestly. I am confident I presented a balanced feature on her. She is quoted accurately as every answer in each interview I do is transcribed in full. My questions are just summarised but in this case, in print, I should have used the exact words I said on the recording. Instead, in the original version I wondered whether “this anomaly suggests there might be a residual issue of racial prejudice in the development of English women’s football”.Sign up to Moving the GoalpostsInformative, passionate, entertaining. Sign up to our weekly round-up of women’s football now.I had sent the online article to an Arsenal representative, who sat in on the interview, and he asked me to change that sentence. I immediately did so and the amended interview said: “Is there a specific reason for this anomaly or is it just coincidental?”Mead has had an extraordinary year and she has been rightly lauded for her achievements. The same is true of her England team. After decades of prejudice against female footballers, Mead and her teammates burst into mainstream sport this summer. It was thrilling but it still seemed strange that the overwhelming majority of their European championship-winning squad was white when football is loved and played successfully by all races in this country.Brushing aside an obvious discrepancy, blaming the media or insisting that there are no such problems in the highest echelons of the game does not make the issue disappear for all those who rightly champion women’s football.Meanwhile, two white people becoming embroiled in an “incident” relating to just one question about diversity distracts attention from the systemic racism that should be our primary focus. Wright and Aluko, speaking with measured clarity, reminded us of this truth. “I called Beth and spoke to her,” Wright told ITV as he reflected on our interview. “We had a great chat. I’m very fond of Beth and yes, it was a bit disappointing seeing that. What was said will obviously stay between us but I think it was a massive moment of reflection and learning for her.”For Aluko the paucity of diversity in women’s football is “a problem for me that is about recruitment and recruitment practices. It’s about making sure we are widening the pool of players for Sarina Wiegman [England’s manager] to choose from, for the younger age groups to choose from, for the academies to choose from”. She said “the talent is absolutely there” but “the inclusion is not”.Wright added that “it’s not a new conversation either. It always feels like we’re starting from scratch”. But his urgency was striking: “There’re still lots of resources and energy that go into [combating] racism in the men’s game. What you want is the same energy and resources in the women’s game.”"
67,Japan manager Hajime Moriyasu hails ‘historic moment’ of win over Germany,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson at Khalifa International Stadium,2022-11-23T18:09:21Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/23/japan-manager-hajime-moriyasu-hails-historic-moment-of-win-over-germany,"Hajime Moriyasu described Japan’s 2-1 comeback win against Germany as a “historic moment” after his team shocked the four-time World Cup winners.Hansi Flick’s side took the lead via Ilkay Gündogan’s 33rd-minute penalty and dominated the first half before Moriyasu made five second‑half substitutions that changed the course of the Group E opener. One of his replacements, Ritsu Doan, equalised on 75 minutes before another, Takumu Asano, scored the winner eight minutes later.“I believe it’s a historic moment, a historic victory, to say the least,” Moriyasu said. “If I’m thinking of the development of Japanese football, we have been building up. It’s a big surprise and we are now reaching the global standard. We saw Saudi Arabia with a surprise win [beating Argentina on Tuesday], so we are showing our capability of Asian football.This is a World Cup like no other.

Support our investigative journalism today.“From the start we decided to be aggressive; however Germany’s aggression was higher. This was no surprise for us. They have a wonderful goalkeeper, Mr Neuer. However our squad were very intelligent, they were smart and played well persistently. They fought really hard.”Moriyasu pointed to the fact that his squad’s development had been aided by a contingent who play in Germany and England, including the match-winner, Asano, who is with the Bundesliga club Bochum.“Of six of our squad, four play in the Bundesliga, two in the Premier League,” Moriyasu said. “They are fighting in these very strong tough leagues. They’ve been building up their strength. So in that context, if those leagues have been contributing to the development of our Japanese players, I respect that and I’m very grateful for this.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballAfter Germany’s second consecutive opening-game World Cup defeat, Hansi Flick offered an honest appraisal. “With this defeat and no points we are under pressure, there is no question about this,” the head coach said. “We are to blame. We can only blame ourselves. We have to make sure we can come out of this. We need to be courageous.”Spain, who thrashed Costa Rica 7-0 in the other Group E game, are next in a match they have to win to ensure control over their own destiny. “We’ll analyse this game as we always do. Of course Spain is a different team and we’ll have a different gameplan,” Flick said. He brushed off Gündogan’s post-game claim that some Germany players did not want the ball. “The statements he made, it’s his opinion and he’s free to express it.”"

He's probably the least fancied player of the team but he is a fighter and showed yesterday the part of genius that is in him,"" Lloris told reporters on Friday ahead of world champions France's Group D game against Denmark.Richarlison's brace took his tally for Brazil to 19 goals from 25 starts and nine in his last seven appearances for the Selecao, a remarkable strike rate at international level.It would have also helped silence any remaining doubters about the 25-year-old's credentials to wear one of the most cherished shirts in world football, even if he has been slow to make an impression under Antonio Conte at Tottenham.""He's a man in form in that yellow shirt. He is yet to score in the Premier League for Spurs but for Brazil he is on fire,"" former England striker and BBC pundit Alan Shearer said.While Richarlison's second goal looked like it was made on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach, his opening effort was an opportunist lunge as he reacted quickly to convert a rebound.Shearer said Richarlison's ability to score all kinds of goals was a huge boost for Brazil.""The positioning of Richarlison to pick up those scrappy little goals, the ones where the keeper is going to tap them out in and around the six-yard box, give me as much satisfaction as the incredible second goal he scored,"" Shearer said.""It looks very simple but it's not. You've got to get in there then finish it. It's very, very good centre-forward play.""His team mates were equally effusive in their praise.""He's a great guy. He deserves it. That's Richarlison. You give him a chance, he scores. You should see him in training. He shoots from anywhere and everywhere, all sorts of angles.""He's an incredible player,"" team mate Antony said.Manager Tite clearly agrees as Richarlison is keeping the likes of Gabriel Jesus out of the starting line-up and he will be keeping his fingers crossed the striker stays fit.It was only a few weeks ago that Richarlison was left in tears as a calf injury appeared to have shattered his dream of playing in the World Cup for Brazil.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.As the World Cup reaches a climax in Qatar, drama on the pitch has partially eclipsed human rights controversies that dogged the Gulf Arab state since it was first chosen to host the competition 12 years ago.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

69,Football Daily | Fifa finally honouring the basic truism that a game lasts 90 minutes,The Guardian,Daniel Harris,2022-11-24T13:08:56Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/24/football-daily-email-fifa-time-keeping-human-rights-world-cup,"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!Once upon a time, there was a footballer called Brian McClair, who was renowned for many things. Unusually, he combined the early part of his career with university study, reading maths, physics, chemistry and statistics at Glasgow – though it was never clear whether it was this or his accent that caused Bryan Robson to observe that “he’s meant to be funny but none of us can understand him”. McClair is also owner of Choccy, one of football’s classic nicknames – “as his last name rhymed with the delicacy ‘chocolate éclair’,” advises Wikipedia – and earned the admiration of the great Lord Ferg for his devotion to training in shorts regardless of the weather. He was also lauded for his devastating finishing in and around the goalline. Had the Puskás Award existed in 1991-92, he would surely have won it for the beauty that can be seen at 1m20s here.But most of all, McClair was renowned for his snot rocket prowess, inspiring playground accidents and scuffles across the British Isles. For the uninitiated, this involves pressing one nostril with a fingertip – though like the Beatles taking inspiration from Dylan then overcomplicating, Paul Ince modified the technique to deploy both – before sniffing downwards through the other, expelling its contents like Mary Poppins emptying her bag. The skill was best deployed immediately after McClair’s team had scored a goal when trailing; he would race into the net and wrestle the opposing keeper to retrieve the ball, then tuck it under an arm and perform before planting it on the centre spot so that the game could resume as quickly as possible.This is a World Cup like no other.

Well, this: the speed at which one can complete the above should not, Football Daily contends, impact the result of a football match. And finally, it seems that the footballing authorities agree. Over the last 159 years laws have been tweaked, binned and invented with the greatest feeling known to mankind – the celebration of a goal – compromised in order to increase the number of correct decisions from 93% to 98.9%, because who didn’t fall in love with the beautiful game because of its reliable decision-making process?But one thing that has until now been left alone is the game’s timekeeping, its workings known only to the secret society of referees. Two first-half goals, a couple of injury stoppages and cards? Two minutes. Five second-half goals, four bookings, numerous talkings-to and relentless timewasting? Four minutes, zero explanations, less than zero accountability. For a long time, it’s been possible to leave a game without actually having seen one. Amazingly, though, in the horrendous abomination of the HR World Cup, this easily resolvable nonsense has been partially addressed. Of course, referees’ watches remain classified. But at last, the time added bears some relation to the time lost, Fifa finally honouring the basic truism that a game lasts 90 minutes. Now all it needs to do is enforce honesty, decency, propriety, probity, tolerance, fairness, equality and integrity, and we’ll really be talking.Daniel Harris is on deck now for Uruguay 1-1 South Korea, Barry Glendenning will be your guide for Portugal 3-1 Ghana at 4pm, while Rob Smyth will be with you for Brazil 2-1 Serbia from 7pm.“Naturality.

71,Christian Eriksen’s miraculous return leading Denmark’s challenge to elite,The Guardian,Nick Ames in Doha,2022-11-19T18:23:09Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/christian-eriksens-miraculous-return-leading-denmarks-challenge-to-elite,"Denmark are a force to be reckoned with as pride, togetherness and skill have coalesced since their talisman’s cardiac arrestChristian Eriksen has been back threading passes through Premier League defences for the best part of a year but there was still something sublime in the fact he was able to sit here, at a modest sports facility on the hazy outskirts of Doha, previewing a World Cup. The thought he might do so had, in the bluntest terms, not crossed anyone’s mind in the aftermath of his cardiac arrest last June but there is a tantalising sense the story may only be part way through.Could Eriksen and Denmark go all the way? That is their intention in Qatar and it would represent a footballing, not to mention personal, comeback for the ages. It would also back up the progress of a team that hovers just below the established favourites but has shown enough, before and since the return of its talisman, to suggest the final step may be possible.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.“It has always been strong but the belief, in the squad and from the fans, was bigger when I came back,” Eriksen said when asked whether, on resuming international duty in March, he had stepped into a different Denmark team. The blend of emotion, pride, togetherness and sheer skill that brought them to the Euro 2020 semi-finals after that fateful afternoon at Parken has bred an irresistible juggernaut: they qualified for this winter’s competition with ease and, earlier this year, beat France both home and away in the Nations League.It is the French with whom they will presumably grapple for top spot in Group D unless Australia or Tunisia, their opponents at Education City Stadium on Tuesday, spring a surprise. “France in a tournament is a different team compared to the rest of the year,” said Eriksen, using characteristic modesty but applying fair logic too. Competing with the elite over four weeks may take something different. “We’re dreaming of something big,” he said. “But in the end we have to get there.”The challenge facing Kasper Hjulmand, Denmark’s urbane manager, is to plot the path. The ultimate leap is to be a side that wins semi-finals and finals. His players could not have been accused of robbery if they had clung on to beat England at Wembley last summer but he has always said the better team won.“The quality of the team is very, very good but I don’t think we’re up there with the very best,” Hjulmand said. “We’ve been discussing it a lot with the players: how can we still try to get there? We are trying to [do it] and climb the last percentages against the best teams.”Eriksen’s addition to the unit that, without his peerless ingenuity, captured so many imaginations should help tilt the numbers favourably. The team looks nicely balanced, with Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Thomas Delaney to either side of him in midfield while Simon Kjær, feted for his reaction to Eriksen’s collapse, has returned from long-term injury to anchor the defence. Atalanta’s Joakim Mæhle will bomb on from left-back while Mikkel Damsgaard and Kasper Dolberg remain bright sparks in attack.Denmark are riding a wave and their longevity has been a pleasant surprise to Hjulmand. “We didn’t know if it was ‘Euro football fever’ in Denmark or just football fever,” he said. “And it was football fever. It’s crazy in Denmark at the moment. I think we’re in a good position. You cannot just go by emotions, to play well we need quality on the pitch, but I think the football quality is there and we’re ready.”When France visited Parken two months ago, demand for tickets reached 120,000. That is more than four times Parken’s capacity but the atmosphere Denmark face in their opener may hinder rather than help. Tunisian supporters have travelled in numbers to Qatar and up to 30,000 could be in the stands: a reliably awkward, often tricky opponent will feel at home and test the Danes’ ability to set a resounding tone.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballWhen a count was made in late September, only 2,000 tickets had been sold to Danish supporters across all three group stage games; this may be the most popular team since the Euro 92 winners but the cloud surrounding Qatar has permeated both fanbase and squad.Denmark have not hidden their dismay about the governing body’s refusal to allow the slogan “Human rights for all” on their training shirts and have pointedly been training in all-black jerseys. They will join other countries in wearing the OneLove rainbow armband, starting on Tuesday, whether it is approved or not.There is the impression Fifa has done little to earn trust and the Danish FA’s sporting director, Peter Møller, bore that out on Saturday after hearing Gianni Infantino’s extraordinary soliloquy that morning. “My personal opinion is he says some appalling things,” Møller said, bristling against the president’s criticism of Europe and pointing out Denmark have worked behind the scenes to help effect change in Qatar. “I don’t understand anything he’s saying. It shows me we are doing the right thing when, the day before the World Cup, he spends almost all his time speaking about all the things we have helped push forward.”Still, a seismic victory in Fifa’s showpiece is the prize on offer. “You need to hit the right moment in games and get a bit of luck, but our goal is to win the tournament,” said the right-back Jens Stryger Larsen. Winning the group could lead to a quarter-final rematch with England; second place would probably bring a fiendish early test against Argentina.“I’m happy to be back, it’s special to be at a World Cup,” Eriksen said. That will describe the feelings sparked watching him pull Denmark’s strings once again, too."
72,Australia’s Awer Mabil: ‘Football has been my life’s guide’ | Sid Lowe,The Guardian,Sid Lowe in Doha,2022-11-21T08:00:49Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/21/australias-awer-mabil-football-has-been-my-lifes-guide,"The player whose penalty ultimately took the Socceroos to the World Cup on his incredible journey from Kenya to QatarAwer Mabil’s extraordinary story begins in the Kakuma refugee camp, Kenya, but he doesn’t want it to end there. He doesn’t want your pity, either. Born to parents fleeing the Sudanese civil war, raised in a small hut, he went half way round the world then half way back again to become a professional footballer in Denmark, Portugal, Tukey and Spain. He is, he points out, one of only four Australians to score in the Champions League and now he’s going to the World Cup. In fact, it was his penalty, at sudden death in the playoff, that ultimately took the country there.He has become a hero and, he hopes, an inspiration, embarked upon a hell of a journey against the odds. After all, he says: “When you come to Europe from Australia you’re nobody, you don’t have the respect, so you have to really work, fight.” But he knows that is not the part people usually focus on; instead his origins in Kakuma eclipse all else. And that, he admits, “starts to piss me off a lot”.“I’ve got that title now of ‘oh, refugee kid’. It’s more for the headlines, for people to try to feel sorry for me, but they never try to understand who I am,” Mabil explains. “Not many would say: ‘he came from Australia to now play in La Liga.’ They’ll say ‘from refugee to …’ I lived in the refugee camp. I was born there, I was there until 10 when I moved to Australia. And I lived in Australia 10 years, so it’s half-half. When you pick just one side for a headline or to make people feel bad, you’re forgetting my other half. And I want to be there for everybody.“When I arrived in Europe I had dreams to chase and a responsibility to encourage other kids: not to feel bad for my story but like ‘let’s understand how this guy faces a challenge’. I want to tell that story too, inspire people from my country, my mother’s country, around the world: that’s more important than being labelled with one thing. Some might hear my refugee story and say ‘that’s inspiring’, ‘that’s beautiful’, but others might be like ‘yeah, he’s not really …’, you know? There are kids in Australia I want to inspire, to show them there’s a path.”In mid-June, he showed them alright, there when Australia needed him. They had drawn 0-0 with Peru in the playoff and after five penalties each, the shootout had reached sudden death. Mabil stood on the spot, alone, “in my own world”, the weight of a country upon him. He had missed in training the day before; now he scored, then watched substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne save from Alex Valera. Afterwards, Mabil called his penalty a thank you to the nation. His hotel room, he said, was bigger than the hut he had grown up in: Australia had given “me and my family a chance of life”.Mabil says: “It’s heartbreaking because on the journey my mum and her parents went through to reach the camp many people died. They were captured by the rebels trying to leave. The way they escaped, we could talk about it all night. It sounds like something from a movie but it’s something they actually went through. The war, the journey, what they faced. For me, hearing it, it’s like: ‘Woah’. What people do to keep their kids safe, what they sacrifice to give them a better life. They didn’t know how long they would be in the refugee camp, they thought they would return home. But there’s no returning home.“I was 10 when we left Kakuma. I remember being loaded on the back of the motorbikes, my friends running after us. ‘Hey!’ ‘Hey!’ Growing up we used to say: ‘going abroad is the best thing ever’, ‘everything’s ok there, no worries’. But leaving was hard and when I came abroad, to Adelaide, I was like: ‘I want to go back.’ Our culture was always being together. I came to Australia, you have a house and it’s fenced off. You feel you can’t go and engage with the people next door. I didn’t speak the language. The first few months, I hated it.”This is a World Cup like no other.

Support our investigative journalism today.There was one thing, a connection. In Kakuma, Mabil had played barefooted with balls of socks; in Adelaide, it was different but still football. “And football,” he says, “is the world game, a language everybody speaks.” It helps when you’re good at it. Mabil laughs. “Everybody wants to be on your team, yeah!” he says. “Football has been my life’s guide.”Mabil was very good at it. Inspired by Tim Cahill, only 17 on his professional debut, he set off to Europe: Midtjylland, Esbjerg, Paços de Ferreira, Kasimpasa, Cádiz. Internationals followed, and now a World Cup. “In Kakuma, I didn’t have access to watch games so when I came Australia and saw 2006 it was like: Wow! And this country is part of it? Wow. Staying up all night. I remember the final so clear with Zidane’s headbutt. And then 2010: my mum, all my family staying up, even more special because it was Africa. Now to be part of it is such a big thing.”He made it so, for all of them. “When I was going up to take the penalty, everything shut off,” he recalls. “Just me and that ball. There’s a little thing I do before, see if the keeper buys it or not – a trade secret I’ll keep to myself for a little bit; maybe after the World Cup I can say! Then I shoot. My normal routine. I’m thinking: just do what you always do.”Well, not always. “After every session, every player took a penalty and the day before I actually missed,” Mabil reveals. “I said ‘no, no, I’m not happy with this.’ I didn’t feel right so I told the coach I want to take it again. I [re-]did it so that the next day I felt comfortable. You bring your luck: if I hadn’t retaken that the day before I would have had a negative feeling. ‘Shit, now it’s 50-50’.”Mabil’s goal left Redmayne to clinch their World Cup place. Sent on for the shootout, he was playing the clown, leaping about his line. “I don’t even think the goalkeepers knew he was going to come on,” Mabil admits. “Matty [Ryan] is our captain, he played in the Premier League for years, he’s our No 1, so I was shocked. I saw Matty, we had eye contact, it was the last minute. But how he handled showed why he’s our captain. He set the ego aside. ‘Ok, this is my role’.”Redmayne saved, his antics getting into Peruvian heads. “The whole game was very mental,” Mabil says. “That few weeks was the most mental challenge I’ve had as a player, given what was on the line. Some were against us, a lot of the media saying we’re not going to make it. Peru thought: ‘Australia, who’s Australia?’, that it was an easy game, which gave us an advantage. Afterwards that you think about what Andrew did and think ‘shit, that was hilarious.’ They made fun of it in Peru, there are memes of him as a bullfighter. But, hey, it worked!”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“I probably didn’t realise how big reaching the World Cup was until I went to Australia after the qualification: at the airport, in the city, everybody was like” ‘oh, thank you!’,” Mabil continues. “That motivates you to qualify directly next time because the stress [of the playoff] isn’t fun: it ages you fast.”“I don’t think people realise how hard it is, especially with Corona [coronavirus]: we played maybe 20 games and only three or four at home. Isolated, unable to get out. European teams travel two hours and go two days before. A lot of our players are overseas so it’s a 24 hour journey: fly today, get there tomorrow, as soon as you’re off the plane, train. Your body clock’s messed up and other countries make it difficult, delaying you at the airport, giving you bad training pitches ...”You think that’s deliberate? “Ah, yeah, 100% mate.”“That makes you stronger. We broke the record – 11 wins running. Us Australians are better the hard way, backs against the wall. This group is special, the circumstances made us stick together even more. Especially when everybody was saying ‘they won’t make it, they’re one of the worst Australian sides we’ve seen’. That’s just people talking, and it’s not true – if anything, we’re one of the best.”They’ll have to be: the world champions await, alongside Denmark and Tunisia. But that, says Mabil, “is how we like it.” There’s an edge to his analysis, a determination: that other journey again. It’s about respect, he says.“We don’t have that yet. Come to Europe and South Americans are regarded as Gods because football’s their sport. There are a lot of Australians who are better than South Americans or Europeans but just get judged differently. It’s like me coming here: ‘Australian?!’ Get on the field and they’re like: ‘oh, you don’t play like an Australian.’ And I ask: ‘how should an Australian play?’ They think an Australian doesn’t dribble, do skills, play football. When you start expressing your football, they’re like ‘oh shit’. That image will change. It’s only a matter of time.”“We have high expectations,” Mabil insists. “Australia reaching a World Cup is almost ‘normal’ now although it’s been a while since we won a game there. But we’re not satisfied just to be there; we want to produce great performances, reach the next round. That’s our target. Our dream is last eight or last 16: a powerful statement for our next generation. Football is No 1 now in Australia for kids’ [participation] and the further we go, the more it helps that grow, and when you engage in sport you automatically have a better society.”“It’s not just winning games, it’s the impact: I know the impact it had on me in Adelaide, watching 2006. It rolls on like a snowball. The targets aren’t just for us. As footballers, you have such a short window representing your country and for me what matters is what it gives the next generation. All the work I do now is to inspire them.”"
73,‘The greatest day of my life’: Saudi Arabia’s female fans bring the noise,The Guardian,Paul MacInnes in Doha,2022-11-28T07:30:18Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/28/the-greatest-day-of-my-life-saudi-arabias-female-fans-bring-the-noise,"Country’s reforms meant there were as many women in green shirts at Education City as there were supporting PolandSaudi Arabia have been bringing the noise in Qatar. Fans have travelled in numbers greater than any other country, with only Argentina coming close. The emerald green shirt is a common sight across Doha. They’re on the corniche and in the metro and, in their first two Group C fixtures, they have generated a fearsome atmosphere within the ground.It may seem an observation that ought not to have to be made, but the Saudi fanbase in Qatar is made up of both men and women. At Education City on Saturday afternoon, perhaps one in 20 of those making their way into the stadium were female, making them equivalent to the number of women there to support Poland. This is a first.Three years ago, as part of a series of reforms, a decree from the Saudi royal family announced that women would be allowed to leave the country without first acquiring the consent of their male guardian. The guardianship system remains, and applies to every woman throughout their lives, with the role of guardian transferring from father to husband. But it does not apply in as many aspects as it once did – which means that going to this neighbouring World Cup, for a country that is demonstrably football mad, is now possible for everyone.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.Talking to female supporters before the match was not easy. Requests to talk were politely turned down and business cards offering the opportunity to talk later – just about the football – were returned. One woman, wearing the niqab, agreed to speak. Her name was Aliya, it was her first time watching her national side and she was optimistic: “Inshallah we will win.” She said she was excited about being part of the experience: “I am looking forward to the cheering and the people in there, the whole experience”. Her husband took over. “This is the World Cup – this is what it means,” he said. “Saudi will go to the next stage, we will have female teams and a female league. Our new president supports everything and ladies come first.”The president of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation is Yasser al-Misehal, a former chair of the Saudi men’s professional league and a member of Fifa’s disciplinary committee. It is true he has presided over rapid change in the women’s game in the country. Two years ago the Saudi Women’s Premier League was established, the first national competition for women’s club sides. Then, in the spring of this year, a potentially more momentous event occurred: a first international fixture, with Saudi Arabia women beating the Seychelles 2-0 in a friendly in Mauritius, the first step on a proposed pathway into the official Fifa classification.The growth of the women’s game comes a decade after Saudi officials were lobbying Fifa to ban the wearing of the hijab in football, a measure that would prevent women from playing the game at all. Five years ago women were not allowed into stadiums as spectators, the ban eventually lifted in three venues at the beginning of 2018. That these changes have been made at the same time as Saudi looks to claim a more central role in the sporting world, and with a potential bid for the 2030 World Cup on the way, may not be a coincidence. But they are real.A few minutes after I spoke to Aliya, Mariam Meshikhes walked past with her friend. Mariam lives in the east of Saudi Arabia, was attending her first match and wearing a replica Saudi away shirt and a light green hijab. It was fair to say she was not reluctant to talk about the experience.“This is my first World Cup, this is my first game I have ever attended in a stadium for the Saudi national team – this has been my dream since I was a teenager,” she said. “I have watched all the games. As a teenager I watched all of them and I was just wishing to be there and I can’t believe that this is the day.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballAt this point her friend, an engineer, observed that Mariam, a doctor, had left her twins at home with her husband. “They’re OK, they’re OK,” she said. “They know I’m happy.”What, Mariam was asked, did she think female football fans bring to a previously all-male crowd? “Well, civility, obviously,” she smiled. “Females are needed everywhere; we’re 50% of our country – more than 50% of our country, right? She’s an engineer, I’m a doctor so we’re already participating in our country. Now it’s amazing that we are able to participate in rooting for our country in the World Cup. And to attend when they are on a winning streak – inshallah – and hopefully they win and they have a very big chance to be the first qualifier to the 16th round, was just ... you have no idea ... this is the greatest day of my life.”Of course football doesn’t always make dreams come true and Poland won a well-contested match 2-0. Now the Saudis face a final fixture against Mexico needing at least a point to qualify, and no doubt a stirring speech from their coach, Hervé Renard, will be forthcoming. But the stars of the Poland match were as much the Saudi crowd as the players and they will be out in force at the 88,966-capacity Lusail Stadium on Wednesday. Much has been made of the means by which countries use sport to burnish their reputations, but there can be few more effective ambassadors for Saudi Arabia right now than their supporters. This article was amended on 28 November 2022 to correct a misrendering of the name Hervé Renard."
74,Jack Grealish: ‘What a guy. I will show Almirón the most respect next time’,The Guardian,David Hytner in Doha,2022-12-01T22:30:06Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/01/jack-grealish-what-a-guy-i-will-show-almiron-the-most-respect-next-time,"Manchester City forward addresses issue with Newcastle’s in-form winger and World Cup celebration for fan who has cerebral palsyBy his own admission, Jack Grealish has packed a lot of “stupid stuff” into his 27 years. The Miguel Almirón episode was surely a good example. Grealish was a little drunk and extremely euphoric (or perhaps it was the other way around) as he celebrated Manchester City’s Premier League title triumph last season and he was asked by his teammate Bernardo Silva to explain the final-day comeback win over Aston Villa.Grealish being Grealish, he got carried away with one of his jokes and ended up performing a drive-by on Almirón, the Newcastle winger. One of the secrets, Grealish said on a video shared on social media, was to substitute Riyad Mahrez because “he played like Almirón”. “Do you know what?” Grealish says from England’s World Cup training base in Al Wakrah. “I haven’t actually been asked about that and let me just address it.”And so Grealish does. He makes the point that he had been drinking but, really, there was no excuse. He regrets it and he is sorry. Grealish says that he reached out to the Newcastle defender Matt Targett, with whom he played at Villa, to ask whether he could pass on an apology to Almirón. “Matt just said: ‘Jack, he’s a lovely kid, he’s harmless and he doesn’t speak a lot of English … he won’t really be bothered,’” Grealish says. “I didn’t want to reply [to Almirón] on social media because you dig a bigger hole and I’ve been there with other stuff.”This is a World Cup like no other.

The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.Grealish would reflect even harder when Almirón gave an interview after he was named as the Premier League’s player of the month for October. Almirón, who scored six goals during the period – he has eight for the season – said that Grealish’s comment had nothing to do with his stellar form. “Jack’s a great player first and foremost and I wish him all the best as I always do,” Almirón said.“I thought: ‘What a guy,’” Grealish says. “Because if that was me and somebody had said that about me, I’d have probably been the other way and been like: ‘Fuck it.’ I didn’t realise it was a video to go out but even in private I shouldn’t have said it because he’s a fellow professional. I’ve had a lot of stick off the Newcastle fans and rightly so.“I like to enjoy myself and I just go with the flow but I do some stupid stuff sometimes that I do regret. When I next play against him, I’ll show him the most respect because that’s what he’s done in a situation where he probably didn’t have to. I genuinely hope he does keep scoring – as long as those Newcastle fans stop messaging me.”Grealish is asked whether he has put Almirón in his Fantasy Football team. “Nah, I don’t play that,” he replies. “Everyone loves it. I get about 100 messages every week saying: ‘Is [Erling] Haaland starting?’ It’s not really for me. I love my football but I can’t be arsed with it.”Grealish is nothing if not open and honest. And if he veers off course, at times, his heart is in the right place. When he scored in England’s 6-2 win over Iran in the opening round of group games, he performed a wavy-armed celebration in tribute to a young City fan he had met called Finlay, who has cerebral palsy. Grealish’s sister, Mollie, also has the condition.“I don’t do that for any clout or whatever,” Grealish says. “I do that because that’s what I feel I’m good at sometimes. Because I can relate to it with my little sister. It’s nice for him [Finlay] because he’ll go back to school and probably be quite popular. It ended up being so nice and quite emotional.”It is hard not to warm to Grealish as he holds court, keeping the tone light, at one point despairing at the union flag waistcoat that his dad, Kevin, has insisted on wearing to matches. Grealish is in Qatar to enjoy himself, to be himself, because that is the only way he knows and it is the key to who he is on the pitch – a player who wants to express himself without fear.Grealish’s numbers have not been great since his £100m move from Villa to City in the summer of last year – seven goals, four assists in all competitions – and there is exasperation when he considers how such metrics are “all that people go on about now … so much more than they should.”What Grealish wants people to recognise is courage on the ball and he brings up Silva, who he describes as probably the best player he has played with. Grealish jumps out of his seat to illustrate a moment from a City game in which Pep Guardiola ordered Silva to take the ball off the toes of the goalkeeper, Ederson, to build a move practically from the goalline.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“Bernardo goes off on his little dribble around and I was like: ‘What does he think he’s doing? He thinks it’s school football!’” Grealish says. “He is unbelievable. He doesn’t get loads of goals and assists. But the way he takes the ball under pressure …“Pep says he wants us to show balls, wanting the ball under pressure when the opposition crowd are against you – when you’re at Anfield, everyone is whistling and you’re saying: ‘Give me the ball.’ That is Bernardo in a nutshell. That’s what I think I do a little bit.”Grealish’s love of the game and the way that he cherishes the ball always shines through. It was stamped all over a recent video of him and his City and England teammate Phil Foden playing a game of long-distance no-bounce, their touches and volleys sumptuous.“Luke Shaw said to me: ‘When I come away with England, you can tell who the City lads are,’” Grealish says. “He said: ‘You always have a ball, you always want a ball.’ We get that from being at City. At Villa, you’d be sitting there, [players] on their phones … then at City, you’re sitting there and balls are flying across the changing room, people playing two-touch.”Grealish has made an impact off the bench in each of England’s three games so far. With Senegal looming in the last 16 on Sunday, he intends to embrace any opportunity."
75,SAOT ain’t slow: how does the World Cup’s AI-assisted offside system work?,The Guardian,Paul MacInnes,2022-11-19T13:00:58Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/saot-world-cup-ai-assisted-offside-system-var-qatar,"Technology to assist VAR is designed to ensure offside calls in Qatar are quicker and more accurate – but it is not without flawsIt may have an acronym akin to a reality show but Semi-Automated Offside Technology, or SAOT, was designed to quell drama rather than cause it. An extension to VAR, it was introduced to help reduce problems with one of the most contentious aspects of video-assisted refereeing: how to decide if a player is offside in the buildup to a goal. It will be in use at the World Cup in Qatar.In a nutshell: artificial intelligence crunches location data to map the positions of players when a ball is kicked. If the AI adjudges that a player is offside, an alert is sent to the VAR showing the “kick point” of the ball and the line of offside. After manually checking that alert, the VAR official informs the referee and any on-field decision is amended accordingly.A SAOT decision at the World Cup will be made using data sent from a sensor inside the ball, the Adidas Al Rihla, transmitting its location 500 times a second, alongside that of 12 tracking cameras around the stadium that follow both the ball and 29 different points on a player’s body (the cameras relay their information 50 times a second). The AI will also create a 3D graphic showing the line of offside and the position of players relative to it. That graphic will be generated after the decision is taken and shown to fans inside the stadium and on TV.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.Law 11 of the football rulebook starts out clearly enough: a player is offside, it says, if “any part of the head, body or feet is nearer to the opponents’ goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent”. But there are qualifications that must be applied to that rule. For example: a player can be offside only in the opponent’s half of the field and cannot be offside if an opponent had deliberately touched the ball last. These qualifications are subject to further revisions, too. This season the rule-making body, Ifab, was forced to clarify what “deliberate” meant, an explanation that ran to 400 words.Given its complexity it is not surprising the offside law has provided the greatest challenges for VAR. The basic setup has an official remotely assessing an incident by replaying video footage. Such limitations did not take long to manifest themselves after VAR’s introduction to the Premier League. Video footage often cannot capture the precise moment a ball is kicked, while offside lines were also determined manually. In the case of a high-stakes decision, where the difference between a goal or not is a matter of millimetres, such an approach instantly created the possibility for frustration. Perhaps more crucially, these decisions could take several minutes to be made.SAOT came with the promise that it would be both more precise and quicker, cutting decision times from an average of 70 seconds to 25. Fifa’s head of refereeing, Pierluigi Collina, described SAOT as “faster and more accurate” and “offering better communication to fans”.SAOT made its debut at the Arab Cup in Qatar last year. It has also been taken up by Uefa for this season’s Champions League.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballWhile there is little controversy over the accuracy of decisions under SAOT, calls that judge a player offside by margins not visible in the stadium, or on the video screen, remain controversial with managers and supporters. The main issue with SAOT, however, remains the reason it was brought in in the first place: timing.The Arab Cup passed smoothly but examples unearthed by the ESPN journalist Dale Johnson found delays of well over a minute and, in one instance, over two minutes in making calls on goals with potential offside incidents. This pattern has spilled over into the Champions League this season. Harry Kane had a winning goal ruled out against Sporting Lisbon because of the interpretation of a subclause of the offside law that took four minutes to make. There was also a lengthy delay in Liverpool v Napoli and controversy following an overturned Patrik Schick goal for Bayer Leverkusen against Club Brugge.In the Kane example it is hard not to imagine that the delay was generated not so much by the technology than by the subsequent intervention of human beings whose job it was to apply the offside law in full. Human fallibility and/or subjectivity, alongside the complexity of rules that have been written by humans (handball being not far behind offside in this regard), remain the biggest hurdle to VAR working efficiently. Uefa notes, however, that offside decisions are taking on average 30 seconds less to complete in the Champions League than in this season’s Europa League, where basic VAR is still in operation.In previous Fifa tournaments, namely the men’s World Cup of 2018 and the women’s of 2019, VAR managed to avoid taking centre stage, perhaps due to greater discretion being allowed to the officials on the pitch – something a lot of fans would like to see more consistently. If that is the case again in Qatar, the hope might yet be for the upside of correct decisions without the pain of soul-sapping delays."

77,El Hadji Diouf accuses England of thinking Senegal are already beaten,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson in Doha,2022-12-01T19:00:03Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/01/england-complacent-world-cup-senegal-el-hadji-diouf,"El Hadji Diouf has accused England of believing they have already beaten Senegal and warned that could lead to another famous World Cup victory for his country.Diouf, who was part of the Senegal team that defeated France at the 2002 tournament, is an assistant coach with the squad preparing to meet England in Sunday’s last-16 tie in Qatar. He was complimentary about Gareth Southgate’s side but feels they are guilty of complacency.“I never say Senegal can’t win,” the former Liverpool forward said. “It reminds me of when we play against France: they win the game before they play it and I think England today do the same thing, which is good for us.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.“We don’t have anything to show the world. If you see our squad, we have Édouard Mendy, we have Kalidou Koulibaly [both Chelsea], we have a lot of good players in England. Some play in the Championship but they are really Premier League players, like Ismaïla Sarr [of Watford]. It’s for them to show how good they are.“It is a wonderful draw — who would not want to play this game? The players are excited. Talking to the boys it’s about big games, big players, they have to show how good they are. And definitely, this game is going to be very exciting because England have a good team, good players. I know we are not the favourites but we are going to do everything to beat them and the players can do it.”Diouf said the pressure was all on Southgate’s men. “Definitely yes. England have to [win] but we have to show them that the game is not finished before we play. These boys are ready. They work hard in training, we have a good spirit and just need to keep going.”Diouf, whose former clubs also include Bolton, Leeds, Sunderland and Blackburn, believes England have changed their approach. “They all copy – the national team as well – Pep Guardiola and Man City. They play the same way: they want the ball and score a lot of goals and play tiki-taka.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“[The] players can do it as well, they have a good team and a very good team spirit. It’s not like the Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard time – the two of them don’t like each other – it’s about team spirit and Gareth Southgate did a great job.”Senegal won the Africa Cup of Nations on penalties in February and Diouf is confident they can beat England the same way. “We are always going to win on penalties,” he said. “If we get to penalties we’re going to win it. Easy. I know the goalkeeper we’ve got [Mendy] and I know we can stop some of their penalties.”"
78,Manchester United fans must wait: football’s biggest sale will take time,The Guardian,Will Unwin,2022-11-26T12:00:26Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/26/manchester-united-fans-must-wait-footballs-biggest-sale-will-take-time,"Cristiano Ronaldo is gone and the Glazers are going, but despite such seismic shifts selling Old Trafford will not be a quick dealIn the space of four hours and eight minutes on Tuesday, Manchester United put out two statements that will surely go down in the club’s history. First, the mutual termination of Cristiano Ronaldo’s contract was announced at 5.30pm and it was later confirmed the Glazer family were open to selling up. Most United fans welcomed the news. Their ageing prima donna was heading for the exit and there was renewed hope the unpopular American owners might pack up.It had taken fewer than 10 days from Ronaldo’s melodramatic broadside at United, delivered via Piers Morgan’s knockabout questioning, to the No 7 shirt being vacated. Those in the firing line included the owners, coaches past and present and the club’s training facilities. There was no way back for Ronaldo, not that he wanted one. When his contract was ripped up, the club and player got what they desired.Whereas the writing was on the wall from the moment the first interview snippet was released, the announcement that the Glazers were seeking a buyer for the club came out of the blue. It has taken 17 years for the Glazers – who bought United in a controversial £790m leveraged buyout in 2005 – to accept the turning of the tide at Old Trafford but it will be a little while before they hand over the keys.Due to the coincidental timings, fans will hope the sale of the club might follow in the same speedy manner as Ronaldo’s shooing out the door or the collapse of the European Super League. That, however, is unlikely to be the case.The confirmation that the Glazers are willing to depart in exchange for billions was day one of a lengthy process. When it became public knowledge that Fenway Sports Group was, at minimum, seeking outside investment at Liverpool, it was eight months into the process. Raine Group, which brokered the Chelsea sale and has the same role at United, had the mandate for three years before Roman Abramovich was forced to sell up. Takeovers are a complicated business and the sale of Manchester United will be the biggest in football history.Americans are showing the most interest in Liverpool and we can expect the same at Old Trafford, although the British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe is widely reported be keen to acquire the club. Ratcliffe’s Ineos group already owns Nice in France and the Swiss club Lausanne. There is also Saudi Arabia’s sports minister, Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal, saying his country would support any private sector bids.Where the problems lie, unsurprisingly, are the costs involved in buying such an entity. The asking price is around £3.7bn, which rules out most homegrown investors and others will be put off by the poor state of Old Trafford. It could cost up to £1bn to renovate the stadium and that is a hefty add-on.Following an unsuccessful bid to buy Chelsea Ratcliffe has said he had a meeting with the Glazers in the summer and they told him the club was not for sale, but months later it is on the market. It is not an overnight decision to sell a business of this size. Did Ratcliffe’s interest make the Glazers contemplate the sale or were their minds already made up and they prefer to not sell to the Ineos founder?There will need to be in-depth due diligence and that will just be working through the list of Ronaldo’s gripes. There is plenty to be done at United to modernise a club built on Sir Alex Ferguson’s foundations. From business to football, if they want to continue as the behemoth created alongside the Premier League, changes will have to be made on many levels. A new training ground would be one necessity and an overhaul of the commercial operations another.An optimistic scenario would see a takeover completed next summer in time for the opening of the transfer window. Any incoming owners would want to spend on new players for an early popularity boost, although purely by not being the Glazers they would be one step ahead.Meanwhile, Ronaldo’s departure will have both a short- and long-term impact. His absence at Fulham allowed Alejandro Garnacho more minutes, before he scored the late winner. If United decide against signing a replacement in January, it would be a boost for youngsters such as the Argentinian.While most of the first team squad are away at the World Cup in Qatar, the remaining players are training with the under-21s, allowing Erik ten Hag the chance to evaluate his young charges and see who could be worthy of a chance when the Premier League season restarts. The head coach now has the opportunity to look forward, no longer forced to deal with Ronaldo’s disruptive presence.Thanks to the World Cup, there will be time for the dust to settle at Old Trafford. Fans will not attend a home match until late December, allowing them to absorb the shifting of the sands at United.There is reason for optimism at United after frustration with owners and a club legend but it will take time for the impact of the past seven days to fully take hold. Good things, hopefully, come to those who wait."
79,Promising Serbia get rude awakening with another early World Cup exit - Reuters,Reuters,,2022-12-02T21:31:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/promising-serbia-get-rude-awakening-with-another-early-world-cup-exit-2022-12-02/,"[1/10] Soccer Football - FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 - Group G - Serbia v Switzerland - Stadium 974, Doha, Qatar - December 3, 2022 Serbia's Nikola Milenkovic and Aleksandar Mitrovic look dejected after being eliminated from the World Cup REUTERS/Carl RecineDOHA, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Half-fit players, a leaky defence and a controversial flag that raised diplomatic tensions underlined yet another exit for Serbia in the group stage at the World Cup, proving that their resurgence earlier this year was nothing but a false dawn.Under coach Dragan Stojkovic, Serbia were fancied to give their Group G opponents a run for their money having secured automatic qualification by forcing a talented Portugal side into a playoff to qualify for the World Cup.With an encouraging showing in the Nations League earlier this year, Serbia were expected to finally break their World Cup group stage jinx having never reached the knockouts since the break-up of Yugoslavia.But despite having two promising strikers in Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic, both of whom were in fine form in the league with Fulham and Juventus respectively, the two started together only in their final group game.Mitrovic scored nine goals in the Premier League but an ankle injury severely hampered his preparations for the tournament as Serbia sweated over his availability while Vlahovic did not arrive in Doha 100%.""We came here with a lot of niggles and injuries to our key players. This was very difficult to manage, it was difficult to have a high level of performance at a World Cup,"" Stojkovic said.When Mitrovic did make the starting line-up against Brazil in their opener, he was well off the pace and barely received service in a humbling 2-0 defeat by the pre-tournament favourites which immediately put Serbia on the backfoot.While Serbia did net three goals against Cameroon, their defence was given a reality check when Vincent Aboubakar ghosted past their offside trap twice in three minutes in a 3-3 draw.In the final game, Switzerland ran riot to hand Serbia a 3-2 defeat that consigned Stojkovic's side to the bottom of the group while the Swiss set up a last 16 clash with Portugal.Stojkovic had said before the game that he had hoped to find holes in the Swiss defence, just like in their cheese, but he did nothing about the gaps in his own back line which were exploited by each team they faced.Serbia finished their campaign with one of the worst defences in Qatar having conceded eight goals -- more than their previous two World Cups combined.They were second only to Costa Rica who shipped in 11 -- which included seven in one game against Spain.""Of course there was a period over the last 1-1/2 years where we had a success streak but now we faced a dip (in form),"" Stojkovic added.""It goes without saying that we had problems in defence, but this would have to undergo a deeper analysis.""I shook the players' hands and said they must keep their heads up. They really did their best and gave their maximum.""Off the pitch, a viral image of a flag which showed Kosovo as part of their country allegedly hung in the dressing room during their match with Brazil also put Serbia in the spotlight.FIFA opened proceedings against Serbia's football association after an outcry from Kosovo and Stojkovic, a former captain of Yugoslavia, refused to comment.Questions about Russia's soft support for Serbia at the World Cup were also shut down, even though Stefan Mitrovic said any support at the World Cup was 'welcome', but it cast a pall over the team for the duration of the tournament.At their last two World Cups in 2010 and 2018, Serbia won at least one match but they go home from Qatar without a single win.Although the team had been criticised back home, Stojkovic said he did not read the news and did not even bother paying attention to any of it.""I assume there's criticism because people perhaps expected something else but this is all quite normal,"" he had said before the last group game.""Have Serbia ever been world or European champions, or reached a final? We have to be realistic.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.As the World Cup reaches a climax in Qatar, drama on the pitch has partially eclipsed human rights controversies that dogged the Gulf Arab state since it was first chosen to host the competition 12 years ago.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

It had previously offered a 7% pay rise over two years. As part of its offer, the company said it would make Sunday working optional and offer “more generous” voluntary redundancy terms than initially proposed. It also pledged it would not make any compulsory job cuts until the end of March.There have been months of wrangling over pay and working conditions between Royal Mail and the union. CWU has carried out several strikes in the past few months and has announced plans for a further 10 days of strikes between 24 November and 24 December.Simon Thompson, Royal Mail’s chief executive, said:Talks have lasted for seven months and we have made numerous improvements and two pay offers, which would now see up to a 9% pay increase over 18 months alongside a host of other enhancements. This is our best and final offer.Negotiations involve give and take, but it appears that the CWU’s approach is to just take.The strikes have already added £100m to Royal Mail’s losses so far this year. In a materially loss making company, with every additional day of strike action we are facing the difficult choice of about whether we spend our money on pay and protecting jobs, or on the cost of strikes.Senior MPs on the Treasury committee are grilling Jeremy Hunt, the UK chancellor, on the autumn statement and the economy. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is watching and live blogging here:Our main stories today:Strikes by postal workers around Black Friday and in the run-up to Christmas are to go ahead after their union rejected a pay offer that Royal Mail said was final.Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) will strike for 48 hours on Thursday and Friday and on 30 November and 1 December, and will also carry out single days of action on 9, 11, 14, 15 and 23 December and on Christmas Eve.Meanwhile, the UK transport secretary, Mark Harper, will meet the union leader Mick Lynch on Thursday for the first time for urgent talks to try to call off rail strikes over the festive period.The RMT general secretary defended the industrial action after critical newspaper reports painted him as “the Grinch who stole Christmas”. Lynch said: “I’m not the Grinch.

Take care! – JKEarlier, official US figures showed a better-than-expected rise in durable goods orders of 1% in October. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said:The solid 1.0% m/m rise in durable goods orders in October indicates that business equipment investment continues to hold up reasonably well in the face of higher borrowing costs, helped by a boost to transport investment from easing supply shortages. Nevertheless, we doubt that resilience will continue indefinitely.November saw a solid contraction in business activity across US businesses, according to a business survey. The headline flash US PMI composite output index from S&P Global fell to 46.3 in November, from 48.2 at the start of the fourth quarter. The rate of contraction signalled was the sharpest since August and among the quickest since 2009.Lower output was seen across both manufacturing and service sectors amid increasingly steep declines in demand. The overall fall in activity was the second-fastest since May 2020 as inflation, rising borrowing costs and economic uncertainty weighed on demand. Recession recession recession Flash US PMI Composite Output Index(1) at 46.3 (October: 48.2). 3-month low.Flash US Services Business Activity Index(2) at 46.1 (October: 47.8). 3-month low.Flash US Manufacturing PMI(3) at 47.6 (October: 50.4). 30-monthCWU has issued its statement, saying postal workers are warning the public of the “end of Royal Mail as we know it,” as 115,000 employees will strike over the next two days. The union rejected the company’s “best and final offer,” and accused it of turning the business into a “gig economy-style parcel courier, reliant on casual labour”. It said the proposals entailed thousands of compulsory redundancies, cuts to sick pay, later start and finishing times, no job security commitments and a “wholly inadequate, non-backdated 3.5% pay increase”.In response, the union is arguing for the following proposals to help resolve the dispute:An improved 18 month pay deal including back pay for all workers;A guarantee of no compulsory redundancies;The restoration of previously agreed processes for voluntary redundancies;A joint review of all agreements and the relationship between the CWU and Royal Mail Group;Re-establishing the right of CWU reps to be fully involved and able to negotiate on local revisions;An alternative business strategy that would see Royal Mail Group use its competitive advantage to grow as a company, instead of becoming a gig economy parcel employer. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: We are disappointed that instead of reaching a compromise to avoid major disruption, Royal Mail have chosen to pursue such an aggressive strategy.We will not accept that 115,000 Royal Mail workers - the people who kept us connected during the pandemic, and made millions in profit for bosses and shareholders – take such a devastating blow to their livelihoods.These proposals spell the end of Royal Mail as we know it, and its degradation from a national institution into an unreliable, Uber-style gig economy company.Make no mistake about it: British postal workers are facing an Armageddon moment.We urge every member of the public to stand with their postie, and back them like never before.Royal Mail workers are set to strike over the next couple of days – the busy Black Friday shopping period – after talks between the company and the Communication Workers Union (CWU) ended without agreement.Royal Mail said its “best and final” offer, a pay increase of up to 9% over 18 months, had been rejected, and that the 48-hour strike by 1150,000 postal workers would go ahead.

Any private equity investment in Manchester United would be predicated on growth over the coming years and that will be a key focus for sponsors. Developing the club in line with fan expectations has been a key factor in recent successful investments in Premier League Clubs. The Chelsea auction demonstrated how attractive the best football clubs are for PE investors. It remains to be seen whether the price for Manchester United would exceed that of Chelsea by such a degree that it would need a consortium of sponsors, perhaps alongside other forms of capital, to win an auction.  Manchester United have been hugely successful over the past 15 years at leveraging commercial opportunities and so investors will need to carefully assess the ability to further grow those commercial revenues. The Super League situation showed that there are limits on the ability of top clubs to fundamentally change sporting competitions to drive further revenue growth. While a revamp of Old Trafford is certainly a possibility, the amount of revenue that can be earned from a state of the art stadium will only be part of the value proposition for an incoming PE investor.The owner of the Scotsman and Yorkshire Post has said it will not make a bid for much larger rival Reach, the parent company of the Mirror and Express titles and hundreds of regional newspapers, despite saying it had secured the financial backing for a £350m-plus takeover.National World, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange with a market value of £51m, said that it had decided not to make a formal offer after deciding that “circumstances are not aligned”. Earlier this month it emerged that National World, which is run by the former boss of Mirror newspaper group David Montgomery, was in the early stages of exploring a possible offer for Reach.Montgomery, who has long coveted a takeover of his former employer, had not approached the board of Reach, which is valued at £350m. National World said:Following further work with its advisers, National World has concluded that while there are considerable industrial and financial advantages to combining the newspaper portfolios of the two companies the circumstances are not aligned to proceed any further with the possible offer.This is despite National World having received in principle financial support from within the investment community to fund a potential deal.Shares in Reach, which have slumped by more than 60% this year, fell almost 6% on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news that a takeover offer would not be forthcoming.A combination of National World and Reach, which is already the UK’s biggest regional newspaper publisher owning brands including the Liverpool Echo and Manchester Evening News, would likely have faced an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. Montgomery said:A combination with Reach could unlock very significant operational value for both companies, but not all the elements required to ensure a successful transaction were present. Rather than create unwanted management distractions for both companies and our respective shareholders, we have decided not to proceed with any discussions at this stage.The Glazer family has been urged by Manchester United fans to sell quickly and to make sure they leave the club in the right hands rather than chasing the biggest bid.In an open letter, the Manchester United Supporters Trust also warns the Glazers that any sort of uncertainty could be “disastrous” and tells them “It’s time for a change”. It comes after reports the Americans want at least £6bn for a club they purchased in 2005.“The last 17 years has been characterised by debt and decline – on-the-field and off it,” the letter from Must states. “The vast majority of United fans will agree with the conclusion you appear to have also reached – it’s time for change.We would like to speak to Manchester United fans around the world about their views on the developments at the club.

I’m a trade union official, and I’m determined to get a deal,” Lynch said.His assistant general secretary, John Leach, said he hoped Harper “puts his shoulder behind the wheel and gets a deal moving”, but warned that if a settlement isn’t reached on Thursday then passengers will face “more and more disruption”.Meanwhile, the work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, told Sky News on Wednesday that legislation could be pushed forward “in due course” to ensure a minimum service for passengers and condemned striking workers for putting festive family reunions at risk.With UK households braced for the biggest fall in living standards since records began, as food prices continue to soar and many struggle to pay their energy direct debits this winter, four people share why they are taking on a second job.Jo Thompson, a single mother of two from Lincolnshire, usually works a 45-hour week as an NHS senior analyst and team leader by day, earning a salary of £41,000.By night, she is a pizza delivery driver, a job she took on at the end of August.“I now work around 60 hours per week,” the 44-year-old says.The British manufacturing firm Johnson Matthey plans to cut up to 15% of senior management jobs, in an effort to slash costs as it faces soaring inflation and energy prices.Chief executive Liam Condon said the cuts formed part of plans to simplify the organisation and achieve £150m in annual savings, the Financial Times reported.We had an overengineered administrative layer. We need to make sure we have enough [staff] to do the work and we are not top heavy on [managers]. Condon is pushing ahead with a major revamp of the group, which took a hit from a costly exit from its business manufacturing chemicals for electric car batteries this year.Rail passengers will face more and more disruption unless a settlement is reached in the long running dispute over jobs, pay and conditions, a senior union chief has warned.More than 40,000 members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union across Network Rail and 14 train operating companies are due to strike on December 13-14, 16 -17 and on January 3-4 and 6-7.There will also be an overtime ban across the railways from December 18 until January 2, meaning RMT members be taking industrial action for four weeks.RMT assistant general secretary John Leach said members are “desperate” and have been left with no option but to take industrial action. He said he hopes UK Transport Secretary Mark Harper “puts his shoulder behind the wheel and gets a deal moving” when he meets with RMT general secretary Mick Lynch on Thursday.Leach told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme:Let’s hope that the third secretary of state down in England in less than six months has got something better to say than Grant Shapps and Anne-Marie Trevelyan before him and actually puts his shoulder behind the wheel and gets a deal moving.There’s a deal that can be done here, we’re professional negotiators, our members just want a pay rise, they haven’t had one for two or three years and this will be nearly the fourth coming up.They’ve just got to commit themselves to fairness for our members, but if they don’t then we’re going to see more and more disruption like this and we are determined to see this through for our members.Asked how long strikes could go on for, he said:We will do what we need to do and take this forward.The new transport secretary @Mark_J_Harper was due in Manchester this morning to deliver a speech at the Great Northern Conference but has opted to prerecord it instead.

His weekends are spent cheering on Ipswich Town, where he holds a season ticket, the Arsenal women’s team near his north London address, or playing five-a-side with his teams: Saka Potatoes and Olympique Mayonnaise. He has watched every World Cup since 2002 and enjoys the inclusivity of the event, which even his mum, who doesn’t really care about football, gets into. But this year, he won’t be tuning in.He made the decision in January, when he became aware that more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had died after Qatar embarked on an unprecedented building programme, largely in preparation for the tournament.Murphy was already disappointed that the country, which has a problematic track record with women and LGBTQ+ rights, had won the bid and been given the opportunity to sportswash its image. “I think by not participating in it, you’re partly defining what it is about the game you love,” he says.The boss of a rail workers union has said he is “not the Grinch” ahead of planned fresh strikes in the run-up to Christmas and in the New Year.Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT Union, said the latest walkouts would “show how important our members are to the running of this country”.Strikes are planned across four 48-hour periods on 13-14 and 16-17 December, and 3-4 and 6-7 January.Around 40,000 workers will walk out and there is likely to be further disruption in the days before and after the strikes due to trains not being in the right places.Lynch said the latest strikes would “send a clear message that we want a good deal on job security, pay and conditions”. Referring to the children’s book character who tries to cancel Christmas, he said:I’m not the Grinch. I’m a trade union official and I’m determined to get a deal.The International Monetary Fund has urged China to ‘recalibrate’ its Covid-19 strategy, including boosting vaccination rates, and to shore up its troubled property sector to restore confidence.In a statement following virtual meetings for its annual review of China’s economic policies, the Washington-based fund said it was maintaining GDP growth forecasts issued in October. It is forecasting growth of 3.2% this year and 4.4% next year, assuming a gradual lifting of China’s strict zero-Covid policy in the second half of next year.The IMF’s first deputy managing editor Gita Gopinath said:Although the zero-Covid strategy has become nimbler over time, the combination of more contagious Covid variants and persistent gaps in vaccinations have led to the need for more frequent lockdowns, weighing on consumption and private investment, including in housing.Going forward, a further recalibration of the Covid strategy should be well prepared and include boosting the pace of vaccinations and maintaining it at a high level to ensure that protection is preserved.Chinese authorities are seeking to contain a fresh spike in Covid infections that has dimmed hopes for a quick reopening of the economy, the world’s second-largest.The fund welcomed authorities’ recent initiatives for China’s slumping property industry, including a loan programme to help complete unfinished homes and allowing forbearance on troubled property loans. Gopinath said:Building on these efforts, additional robust and well-funded mechanisms are needed for completing troubled unfinished projects and protecting new presale buyers from the risk of non-completion, while forbearance measures should be phased out.These measures will help restore homebuyer confidence and facilitate market-based restructuring.She stressed the need for structural reforms in the sector and new savings models.IMF urges China to ‘recalibrate’ coronavirus policy, aid vulnerable households amid shaky external environment https://t.co/rp1zObwrdkUK private sector firms recorded another reduction in business activity in November, the fourth month of decline, while new orders fell at the fastest pace for almost two years, according to a business survey. This points to a deepening recession, and is the worst downturn (excluding Covid lockdown months) since 2009.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, which compiled the survey, said:A further steep fall in business activity in November adds to growing signs that the UK is in recession, with GDP likely to fall for a second consecutive quarter in the closing months of 2022. If pandemic lockdown months are excluded, the PMI for the fourth quarter so far is signalling the steepest economic contraction since the height of the global financial crisis in the first quarter of 2009, consistent with the economy contracting at a quarterly rate of 0.4%. Forward-looking indicators, notably an increasingly steep drop in demand for goods and services, suggest the downturn will deepen as we head into the new year.While the recent change of government has resulted in improved business confidence, the business mood remains among the gloomiest seen over the past quarter century amid the numerous headwinds, which include the cost of living crisis, the Ukraine war, steepening export losses (often linked to Brexit), higher borrowing costs, fiscal tightening and heightened political uncertainty.Price pressures meanwhile remain elevated but show further signs of cooling, often linked to weakened demand, which – combined with the growing recession signals – suggest that the Bank of England may start to make less aggressive interest rate hikes in the coming months.The headline seasonally adjusted S&P Global / CIPS flash UK composite output index ticked up to 48.3 in November, from 48.2 in October and signalling a further modest fall in private sector business activity. The index has been below the crucial 50 no-change mark for four months.New orders fell at the fastest pace since January 2021, as squeezed client budgets weighed on demand in both the manufacturing and service sectors.On a more positive note, business expectations for the year ahead rebounded from the 30-month low in October. Many firms mentioned recession worries and increasingly challenging economic conditions, but there were fewer comments citing domestic political uncertainty.🇬🇧 #UK companies faced the worst drop in new orders for nearly two years in November, flash #PMI data suggests, as squeezed client budgets continue to hit demand in both manufacturing and services.

Underlying profit before tax fell 9.3% to £59.2m in the six months to 13 October. People are buying fewer toys and other accessories for their dogs amid the cost of living squeeze but are still spending on essentials like food and litter, and on Christmas ranges.Chief executive Lyssa McGowan said:We are conscious of the macro-economic backdrop and continue to manage the business proactively. The inflationary environment creates pressures for both our customers and the business. We are conscious of the challenges faced by many consumers, and continue to prioritise making pet care as convenient and affordable as possible. We will never let price be a reason not to shop with us.More people bought pets during the pandemic when they spent more time at home and the pet boom has continued despite the cost of living crisis, although demand for more expensive accessories appears to be fading.Analysts at RBC said:Pets is starting to see some evidence of consumers trading down, with new customers buying more of the lower price point, grocery products and more own-brand product.Pets at Home stuck to full-year guidance of an underlying profit of around £131m. It has 457 stores, many of which also have vet practices and grooming salons.Halfords has launched a drive to fill 1,000 technician roles over the next 12 months by targeting more retired and female recruits, as the UK’s tight labour market pushes employers to think up new hiring strategies.Announcing a halving of interim profits as customers cut discretionary spending amid the cost of living crisis, the motoring and cycling retailer warned that its full-year results will be at the lower end of expectations. Its shares fell more than 6% on the news.However, it said inflationary pressures had also driven membership of its motoring loyalty club from drivers keen to cover the soaring cost of running a car. Its chief executive, Graham Stapleton, said: “To help meet that demand, we are today launching a recruitment drive to fill 1,000 new automotive technician roles over the next 12 months. In particular, we are hoping to attract retirees back into the workforce, as well as increasing the number of women in technician roles.”The FTSE 100 index has advanced 41 points, or 0.56%, to 7,494, while other major European indices are in the red. Germany’s Dax has lost 0.2%, France’s CAC is flat and Italy’s FTSE MiB has edged 0.2% lower.The pound is little changed against the dollar and the euro, trading at $1.1888 and €1.1528. Crude oil prices have risen almost 1% with Brent, the global benchmark, at $89.19 a barrel.Business activity declined across the eurozone for a fifth month running in November but at a slower pace, according to flash PMI data from S&P Global. The headline index rose to 47.8 from 47.3 in October, inching closer to the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion.Although the rate of decline remained the second strongest since 2013, excluding Covid-19 lockdown months, the intensity of the downturn moderated in response to a reduced rate of loss of new business, fewer supply constraints and a pick-up in business confidence about the year ahead. Business sentiment nevertheless remained gloomy by historical standards, and demand continued to fall at a steep rate, leading to a pull-back in employment growth during the month.One upside of the weaker demand picture and alleviation of supply constraints was a cooling of price pressures, most notably in the manufacturing sector. Firms’ costs rose at the slowest rate for 14 months, in turn allowing selling price inflation to moderate, albeit with rates of inflation remaining elevated.The downturn in the #Eurozone economy eased slightly in November, flash #PMI data signals, as the headline index picks up to 47.8 (Oct: 47.3) and inflation cools.

Its new boss, Ulrich Körner, has been tasked with scaling back the investment bank and slashing costs, with plans to spin it off to focus on wealth management.The Swiss bank said its wealth management division and investment bank were likely to make a loss between October and December. Overall outflows were 6% of assets under management at the end of the third quarter. The Zurich-based bank said:Credit Suisse began experiencing deposit and net asset outflows in the first two weeks of October 2022 at levels that substantially exceeded the rates incurred in the third quarter of 2022.In wealth management, these outflows have reduced substantially from the elevated levels of the first two weeks of October although they have not yet reversed.And returning to the potential sale of Manchester United, which has been welcomed by fans, the US-listed shares have risen about 10% in pre-market trading.They closed more than 14% higher last night after Sky News was first to report that the Glazer family were considering selling the club, but that left the share price only slightly above its 2012 flotation price of $14. The club’s market value peaked at $4.3bn in 2018.Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says:Manchester United is trading higher by almost 10% this morning after the Glazer family announced plans to potentially sell the club a day after Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure, which would bring their 17-year ownership to an end.Investors are cheering the news amid hopes that this could be the beginning of a new era for the club after a disappointing performance over the last few years. The expectation is that there could be a number of potential deep pocketed bidders including Sir Jim Ratcliffe who expressed an interest in buying Man U in August. Although the club was recently valued at £3.75bn, the club has the potential to sell for much more than that.The shares are trading higher by more than 26% so far this year.More on the rail strikes.Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said people have a right to campaign for a fair pay deal but that ultimately a deal is needed. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We recognise people have got a right to do everything they can to campaign for a fair pay deal, and they will continue to do so.And people have a right to withdraw their labour and to strike as part of that, and we’ll always support people’s right to be able to do that, but ultimately we need a deal in place, and that is what we’ve been calling for.She said she wants the government to “get its act together on this”.Business activity in the French private sector shrank for the first time since February 2021, the PMIs showed.

There will be a further two strikes on 3-4 and 6-7 January.Work and pensions secretary Mel Stride said on TalkTV this morning:What we need is we need more talking from the unions with the employers and less announcements of strikes.He said the consequences of the strikes announced by the RMT union in December and January would be “quite serious”, disrupting “medical appointments, for example, as well as “family reunions” over the festive period.The timing of these strikes are designed to create maximum disruption across the Christmas period.The Secretary of State is actually meeting the rail union leaders later this week, so there is that dialogue occurring.The essential discussions have to occur between the rail operating companies, Network Rail and the unions, and they really should be engaging more on that and working things out between them more vigorously, in my view, than simply rushing off and going into strike action.Announcing the strikes on Tuesday, the RMT’s general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: This latest round of strikes will show how important our members are to the running of this country and will send a clear message that we want a good deal on job security, pay and conditions for our people.We have been reasonable, but it is impossible to find a negotiated settlement when the dead hand of government is presiding over these talks.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.The Glazer family are looking to sell Manchester United after owning it for 17 years, triggering a 27% jump in the share price to $16.6 in after hours trading on Nasdaq.The Glazers announced last night that they were “commencing a process to explore strategic alternatives” for the Premier League club, on the same day it was confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo had left Old Trafford by mutual agreement.A statement from United revealed plans to identify new investment that could lead to a potential sale. The club said the process led by their American owners will consider a number of options “including new investment into the club, a sale, or other transactions involving the company”. The Raine Group, which oversaw the sale of Chelsea earlier this year, has been appointed as the exclusive financial adviser.In August, Jim Ratcliffe, the UK’s richest person, expressed an interest in buying United. “If the club is for sale, Jim is definitely a potential buyer,” a spokesperson for him said. Last month, though, Ratcliffe claimed he had met the Glazers and they did not wish to sell.The club was valued at nearly $2.5bn (£2bn) on the New York stock exchange yesterday, but is expected to fetch at least twice as much if sold. The Glazers took control of United in a £790m deal in 2005, loading the club with £500m of debt, and later listed a minority stake, in 2012, but retained control through a dual-class share structure which gives them almost all voting rights.The announcement that they were considering selling comes after years of protest from the fans, chanting “Love United, Hate Glazers”. United has not won the Premier League since 2013 and the fans want to see more investment in the club.David Cogan, a media executive who negotiated the sale of the Premier League’s TV rights, has been talking about this on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.The owners have said we’ve done our 17 years, we’ve taken out as much as we can, we’re under constant pressure from fans and therefore what we need to do is try to find a buyer at a time when the Premier League looks like it might make more money because lots of people are buying rights and we’ve got the asset value to where we could get it.And what’s really driven that is the differences in value. A year ago Newcastle sold for £305m. Chelsea sold for £2.5bn plus an additional £1.75bn for reinvestment in the club, nearly £5bn. When you’re Manchester United or you’re Liverpool and you’re the owner of those clubs, you look at those numbers and say we can easily get that, and that’s a huge return on our initial investment.He said large American hedge funds may be interested in buying the club, noting that they have been buying media rights of sports assets, for example in rugby.It may well be that all these American hedge funds are looking at football assets believing they are undervalued even at £4bn or £5bn because the Premier League will continue to grow...Most fans are quite happy if the money is coming in.Roman Abramovich sold Chelsea for £4.25bn to a consortium led by the American businessman Todd Boehly in May. Newcastle United was sold by Mike Ashley for £305m last October to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.Otherwise, the focus today is on the latest flash PMIs for November, closely-watched business surveys, as well as the minutes from the US Federal Reserve’s last meeting when it hiked interest rates as expected by 75 basis points.Most Asian stock markets have gained while oil and the dollar slipped, as rising Covid-19 cases in China triggered fears of fresh lockdowns that could hold back the reopening of the world’s second-biggest economy.European stocks are expected to rise at the open, after they reversed their Monday losses and closed at three-month highs on Tuesday.The Agenda8.15am GMT: France S&P Global PMIs flash for November8.30am GMT: Germany PMIs flash for November9am GMT: Eurozone PMIs flash for November9.30am GMT: UK S&P Global/CIPS PMIs flash for November1.30pm GMT: US Durable goods orders for October (forecast: 0.4%)2.45pm GMT: US S&P Global PMIs flash for November3pm GMT: US Michigan Consumer sentiment final for November (forecast: 55)3pm GMT: Treasury committee to quiz UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt on autumn statement7pm GMT: Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill speech on returning inflation to target7pm GMT: US Federal Reserve minutes"
81,World Cup 2022 briefing: Business time for England against Senegal,The Guardian,"Rob Smyth, Will Magee, Will Unwin, Gregg Bakowski, Luke McLaughlin and Niall McVeigh",2022-12-04T04:00:02Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/04/world-cup-2022-briefing-england-senegal-france-poland,"Gareth Southgate still has his critics despite a record group-stage return. Can the Three Lions silence the doubters?After all that noise – the joy, the triumphalism, the entitlement, the schadenfreude, the self-loathing – England had the best record of any team in the group stage at Qatar 2022. It shows how far they have come under Gareth Southgate that seven points and nine goals, the latter a record for England at a major tournament, was not enough to please Twitter’s finest.Even in the hysterical world of the England national team, it’s hard to remember the last time that the balance between on-field achievement and off-field angst was so far out of whack, and that is unlikely to change unless England win handsomely against Senegal tonight. After a semi-final in 2018 and a final last year, the louder elements of the media, traditional and social, have come to a near unanimous conclusion: Southgate is holding England back.The received wisdom is that England have an embarrassment of riches in attacking areas. Fine players though they are, we might be confusing the excellence of the Premier League with that of the national team. Since England became good again in 2018, a total of 10,158 voting points have been available at the Ballon d’Or. (Bear with us, this isn’t as boring as it sounds.) Premier League players picked up 3,431 of them, or 33.78%. But English players received only 86, or 0.85%. That’s less than Eden Hazard, and he has barely played in the last three years. For all his imperfections, most obviously his indecisive in-game management, Southgate has significantly overachieved with a squad that is not as talented as the “golden generation” of the mid-2000s.Senegal, who they face tonight, have been filed under “awkward opponent but one England should beat”. England have never lost to an African team, a statistic that has been cited frequently in the buildup. Despite 30 years of watching players as stylistically diverse as Nwankwo Kanu, Mo Salah, Sadio Mane, Jay-Jay Okocha and Yaya Touré in the Premier League, there is a perceived homogeneity to African football that doesn’t reflect well on English football’s subconscious.France are also in action today, taking on a Poland side who qualified for the last 16 with their tail between their legs. It should be a joyous occasion, Poland’s first knockout game at the World Cup since a closer-than-it-sounds 4-0 defeat by Brazil in 1986, but their pitiful performance against Argentina – no shots on target, no ambition, but only one yellow card – has changed the mood. It depends on what happens against France, but when the story of Poland’s 2022 campaign is written, historians may conclude that it would have been better to go out with a bang than through with a whimper.England have no such choice. Unless they go through with a bang against Senegal, the knives – and the hashtags – will probably be out. RSNetherlands ease into last eightSince Louis van Gaal took charge the Netherlands are unbeaten in 19 matches. In yesterday’s ruthless 3-1 dismissal of the USA they appeared to be a team playing within themselves, still with plenty of room for improvement in their quarter-final against Argentina – and perhaps beyond. There was a smidgen of defensive vulnerability to be seen when the USA fought back to 2-1 in the second half, but that recovery was swiftly squashed by a third Dutch goal, scored by the exceptional Denzel Dumfries. If nothing else, neutrals should hope the Netherlands stay in the tournament for the mental stimulation being offered by Van Gaal. Every time he speaks it seems to be something amusing, insightful or both. “Yesterday I gave him a big, fat kiss,” Van Gaal said of Dumfries, who was sitting beside him in the press conference. “And I’m going to give him another big, fat kiss.” As always, he meant what he said. LMcA moment to forget for Australia’s RyanThe manner of Australia’s exit was particularly painful for the goalkeeper Mathew Ryan after his blunder handed Argentina their second goal, slotted in by Julián Álvarez. Kye Rowles’ back pass wasn’t ideal, and hindsight is always a wonderful thing, but the effectiveness and urgency of Argentina’s pressing at that moment meant the Socceroos goalkeeper would have been wise to put his foot through the ball and aim for Row Z. Instead Ryan lost it and Álvarez did the rest. The margins would have been tight regardless but when they were chasing the game, Australia showed the vulnerability that clearly exists at the heart of Argentina’s defence. They will wonder what might have been but Ryan, and the Socceroos collectively, can be proud of how they performed in Qatar. LMcWith drama aplenty in the group stage, stories in the global media have largely focused on the thrilling football – exactly as Qatar’s Supreme Committee and Fifa want it. Sean Ingle reports that the country is so happy with how the tournament has gone that it can be a springboard to hosting the biggest sporting event of all, the Olympic Games. The Guardian understands the country is ready to flex its muscles again and bid to stage the Games in the autumn of 2036, despite having failed with bids three times in the past. Ingle reports there is “growing optimism in Doha” that this World Cup will prove they can host the Olympics. But there will be obstacles, from LGBTQ+ rights to commercial concerns from the IOC after Qatar’s 11th-hour alcohol ban at stadiums. GBThere was disappointment in the US after the national team were brushed aside by the Netherlands. “The subpar play from practically the entire team counts as a major disappointment,” wrote Jeff Carlisle for ESPN. In the Washington Post, Steven Goff wrote: “The US men’s team had reached the knockout stage with a blend of defensive excellence, precocious poise and unflinching confidence – but these things were missing [on] Saturday.”In Australia, journalists digesting the Socceroos’ early-morning exit were more sanguine. “One piece of genius from the greatest player of all time, and a rare mistake from one of Australia’s most loyal servants. In a sport defined by razor-thin margins, sometimes, that’s just the way it goes,” accepted Vince Rugari in the Sydney Morning Herald. The Guardian’s own Emma Kemp wrote: “This was not a bad performance. It was a very good performance with all the makings of another upset; the moving mass of blue-and-white tension in the stands confirmed it to be so.”Meanwhile in South Korea, the official World Cup anthem Dreamers, featuring Jungkook of BTS fame, is getting plenty of airtime as they savour a place in the Round of 16 following the dramatic late win against Portugal. Not a patch on Shakira’s 2010 World Cup banger, Waka Waka (This Time for Africa), but admittedly that’s a high bar. LMc/NMcNo social media post was more gratefully received by the world of football than the one posted by Pelé on Instagram. After a day of reports that the Brazil legend was receiving end-of-life care, Pelé shared a positive update from his hospital, adding that he felt “strong” and “with a lot of hope”. The 82-year-old, still the only player to win three World Cups in his career, will continue treatment, and we wish him well. NMcThis article includes content provided by Instagram.

Szczesny was decisive.” The France head coach knows their last-16 opponents have enough quality to cause an upset – and some “hardcore” individuals with enough experience to rile France. Szczesny has been in fine form in Qatar, while Lewandowski has broken his World Cup duck and will be confident of causing problems for the French centre-backs. France’s second string were appalling against Tunisia, a sign they Deschamps does not have much in reserve. If Poland can keep it tight until deep into the game, they will hope to crank up the pressure on the reigning champions. WUEngland v Senegal (Round of 16, 7pm GMT, ITV1)Senegal are missing a number of key players – and potentially their head coach Aliou Cissé due to illness – for this most vital of games. Sadio Mané, Cheikhou Kouyaté and Idrissa Gueye are all missing through a mixture of injury and suspension. Not only are they quality players but possess incredible experience, which will be sorely missed. Their replacements face a tough job to defeat an England team in good form. Sheffield United’s Iliman Ndiaye has already been given a chance in Mané’s absence and impressed in the victory over Ecuador.

They showed that it is not names that are playing, but what is more important is heart and courage.” Japan defeated Germany despite having 29% possession, while they overcame Spain with just 22%. “Possession means nothing in football today,” said Josip Juranovic, the Croatia right-back, when those stats were put to him. “They play very well as a team and they are fast.

They boast some more recognisable names than the Qataris, including Premier League midfielder Moises Caicedo and veteran striker Enner Valencia.""Believe in us! We're working as hard as we can to give joy to the whole nation,"" said Valencia.Both teams will seek to ignore the razzmatazz of the opening ceremony and the pressure of a vast global audience, with way more focus than normal on what would otherwise be a less-than-mouthwatering game for global spectators.Even if they lose, Qatar will want to at least avoid humiliation and prove that they are worthy of a place, given the torrent of criticism over governing body FIFA's awarding of the tournament to a nation that had never qualified before.They will also be happy to be kicking a ball rather than dealing with the controversies over their nation's human rights record that reached a crescendo as the tournament arrived.Ecuador, too, will be relieved just to be walking out after they faced possible expulsion over an accusation of fielding an ineligible player.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.As the World Cup reaches a climax in Qatar, drama on the pitch has partially eclipsed human rights controversies that dogged the Gulf Arab state since it was first chosen to host the competition 12 years ago.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

83,"As a female referee, this World Cup is a positive step – and a deserved one | Kirsty Dowle",The Guardian,Kirsty Dowle,2022-11-18T15:33:16Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/nov/18/female-referees-world-cup-qatar-positive-step,"Six female officials from five confederations will take part at the tournament in Qatar and hopefully this marks just the startWomen will officiate at a men’s World Cup for the first time in Qatar – and that is a positive step for female officials across the globe. Three referees and three assistant referees will form part of the 129 match officials who will cover the 64 matches and their selections are nothing to do with gender and all about merit.The 36 referees, 69 assistant referees and 24 video match officials have been selected on their performances during Fifa fixtures and at other international and domestic competitions.The six making history are: the referees Stéphanie Frappart from France, Yoshimi Yamashita from Japan and Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda, and the assistant referees Neuza Back from Brazil, Karen Díaz Medina from Mexico and Kathryn Nesbitt from the USA. The fantastic element of the selections is that they will be representing five confederations: AFC, Caf, Concacaf, Conmebol and Uefa.The selections conclude a long process that started several years ago with the deployment of female referees at Fifa men’s junior and senior tournaments. I hope this is only the start and it becomes the norm seeing female officials at the biggest men’s tournament.Whereas national teams have been arriving in Qatar over the past week, the officials met the previous week and that allows for a strong period of further integration for all those attending their first World Cup. This follows several seminars over the past few years, culminating in a main focus in the summer which allowed the officials to come together to work collaboratively on reviewing and analysing video clips of match situations and to take part in practical training sessions with players. These were filmed to enable participants to receive instant feedback from instructors.Included in those seminars were England’s two teams of World Cup officials: Anthony Taylor, Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn; and Michael Oliver, Simon Bennett and Stuart Burt. Every official will be judged equally on the quality of their performances and will have undergone the same fitness testing to ensure they can operate over the next month on the biggest stage of all.The elite female officials there are used to pressure through their involvement in the top levels of their national leagues and that will stand them in good stead for matches potentially watched by billions of people around the globe. From my own experiences, Fifa is really supportive of all officials.The transition of more female officials into the top levels of the men’s game is also happening closer to home. Most notably, Natalie Aspinall has followed in the footsteps of Sian Massey Ellis into the Premier League, but a growing number of us are also officiating regularly on EFL fixtures, many driven through new opportunities via the elite referee development plan.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballDuring my nine years as a referee, including three as a Fifa official since joining the list in 2020, I have had the pleasure of working alongside individuals from different backgrounds and cultures and in mixed-gender teams in men’s and women’s leagues. That only enhances the environment and helps to deliver the highest possible standard of refereeing.This World Cup is a fantastic and welcome opportunity for six deserving female officials to showcase their quality. They are some the best, which is why they are there. I send my very best wishes to them for a successful tournament.Kirsty Dowle is a Women’s Super League and Fifa referee who also officiates in men’s football"
84,Manchester United up for sale as Glazers announce plans to leave Old Trafford,The Guardian,Jamie Jackson and Ed Aarons,2022-11-22T22:24:13Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/22/manchester-united-up-for-sale-as-glazers-announce-plans-to-leave-old-trafford,"The Glazer family has announced it is “commencing a process to explore strategic alternatives” for Manchester United, potentially bringing an end to its 17-year ownership of the club.On the day it was also confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo had left Old Trafford by mutual consent, a statement from United on Tuesday night revealed plans to identify new investment that could lead to a potential sale. The club said the process led by their American owners will consider a number of options “including new investment into the club, a sale, or other transactions involving the company”.The Raine Group, which oversaw the sale of Chelsea earlier this year, has been appointed as the exclusive financial adviser.“The strength of Manchester United rests on the passion and loyalty of our global community of 1.1 billion fans and followers,” said the executive co-chairmen and directors, Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer. “As we seek to continue building on the club’s history of success, the board has authorized a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives. We will evaluate all options to ensure that we best serve our fans and that Manchester United maximizes the significant growth opportunities available to the Club today and in the future. Throughout this process we will remain fully focused on serving the best interests of our fans, shareholders, and various stakeholders.”United were most recently valued at £3.75bn but would expect to fetch far more given that a consortium led by the US businessman Todd Boehly paid £4.25bn for Chelsea in May.The Glazer family can expect to attract a number of interested suitors as the successful bidder would have the opportunity to markedly increase the club’s value.Sky News said United’s share price immediately rose by 17% after reports the glazers were considering a sale emerged, adding almost $400m (£335m) to the club’s market capitalisation.Old Trafford and the vast land that surrounds the stadium has the potential to undergo a development that would transform it into a destination venue similar to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Spurs’ £1bn investment includes a Michelin star grade restaurant, a complex of high end stores, a Grade II-listed building, an art gallery and Europe’s largest club shop.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballIn August, Jim Ratcliffe, the UK’s richest person, expressed an interest in buying United. “If the club is for sale, Jim is definitely a potential buyer,” a spokesperson for him said.Last month, though, Ratcliffe claimed he had met the Glazers and they did not wish to sell.“We can’t sit around hoping that one day Manchester United will become available,” the Manchester‑born businessman said.“We have an exciting sporting franchise [the Ligue 1 side Nice], but the one thing we don’t have is a Premier [League] team. The most popular sport in the world is football and it is the sport we were brought up with and it’s the one most close to us. We really should have an asset in the sporting franchise.”While his interest might now be revived, the sizable constituency of United fans who are hostile to the Americans will be delighted if they do decide to sell. The Glazers have faced serial unrest since Malcolm Glazer bought United in 2005 via a leveraged financial model that loaded a debt on the club that still stands at around £500m."
85,Miracle of Doha 2.0: Japan rejoices again after controversial World Cup win,The Guardian,Justin McCurry in Tokyo and agencies,2022-12-02T04:28:48Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/02/japan-vs-spain-world-cup-2022-victory-controversial-goal-win-miracle-of-doha-2,"It turns out that football miracles can strike twice. In quick succession, and in the same place. After their team’s shock defeat to Costa Rica last Sunday, many Japanese fans were bracing for an early exit from the Qatar World Cup at the hands of Spain.Instead, the Khalifa International Stadium was the backdrop to another extraordinary night for Japanese football, as the Samurai Blue beat the 2010 world champions 2-1 to send them into the last 16 and a meeting with the 2018 runners-up, Croatia. Victory in that match would take Japan to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time.“Doha delights again!” one newspaper headlined its online edition, evoking memories of what the media labelled the “Miracle of Doha” after Japan’s win over Germany.Much of the post-match punditry centred on Japan’s winner, after the ball was judged by the VAR to have stayed in by a fraction before Kaoru Mitoma crossed it for Ao Tanaka to bundle home, sparking wild celebrations in Doha and Tokyo. The Daily Sports said Japan had “come within a millimetre” of exiting the tournament. “Luck was on Japan’s side,” the tabloid said. Tokyo Sports, meanwhile, noted that the team had again become the talk of the tournament, days after their shock 2-1 win against Germany, who failed to get out of their World Cup group stage for the second tournament in a row.“The foreign media didn’t expect Japan to do well,” the paper said. “But they are all getting excited now, including the BBC.”The VAR controversy was also the talk of social media, with one account joking that it had spawned a new design for Japan’s national flag.Japan's new flag. #JPN pic.twitter.com/KBHOP8wZoFWhile Japanese fans have long been praised for tidying up stadiums around the world, on Thursday there was as much online love for the players.“Not sure I’ve ever been more pleased for any side in any sport,” Seth Levine said in a message to the Guardian’s live blog. “Love the way they play. No s**t-housery. No histrionics. Brilliant fans. Excellent tactically. Manager wears a charcoal three-piece suit. What’s not to love?”Ben Mabley, who commentates in Japan on Premier League football, had a message for those who doubted Japan’s footballing pedigree. “Ever since I came to Japan, I’ve heard people say that Japan doesn’t have much of a football history. I don’t want to hear that ever again!” he tweeted in Japanese. “An amazing history is unfolding right before your eyes! Congratulations!”This is a World Cup like no other.

I couldn’t believe the transformation in the second half. It’s been a week-long rollercoaster ride. We were elated after Germany, then in despair after Costa Rica. Who knows what’s going to happen next? Croatia aren’t as good as they were four years ago, but I’m trying not to get carried away.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballNot even the pre-dawn kick-off could deter fans who braved the cold to watch the match together on giant screens, or set their alarms to follow the game from their futons, knowing they would have little or no time to snooze before getting ready for work.Fans chanting “Nippon! Nippon!” celebrated before sunrise on the famous scramble crossing in Tokyo’s Shibuya district, and later exchanged high-fives with bleary eyed commuters pouring out of the train station.“I never thought Japan would finish top of their group. Thank you, Japan! I love you guys,” said 19-year-old fan Yusei Sato.Takuya Kudo, 23, burst into tears as soon as the final whistle blew. “I’m just so happy,” he said. “Honestly, I never thought Japan would do this well. I’m just really thrilled.”“Samurai Blue” and “Come-from-behind victory” were trending on Twitter, while one user posted a cartoon of a roaring Japanese dragon flanked by those from a lucky Spain, who also qualified from Group E, and clearly bewildered Germany.Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka posted a manga-style depiction of the Japanese team, while Elon Musk tweeted: “Congratulations, Japan!”The prime minister, Fumio Kishida, described the victory as “historic”, adding that he had called the team’s coach, Hajime Moriyasu, and the president of the Japan Football Association, Kozo Tashima, to offer his congratulations. “I told them they gave the Japanese people courage and energy,” Kishida said on Twitter. “We are looking forward to the last 16. Fight on, Japan!”Moriyasu, who had been criticised for his tactics in the 1-0 defeat to Costa Rica, thanked Japan’s travelling fans and the many more back home who had got up in the middle of the night to watch his team. “This victory is a gift for the people of Japan,” he said."
86,Gary Lineker: ‘Southgate has earned the right to succeed or fail in Qatar’,The Guardian,Paul MacInnes,2022-11-14T18:39:06Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/14/gary-lineker-southgate-has-earned-the-right-to-succeed-or-fail-in-qatar,"Presenter and former striker on England’s World Cup chances, being ‘stuck’ with the host nation, and backing Brazil for glory“England can win it,” says Gary Lineker of this year’s World Cup. “We need luck, we need breaks, we need all our players to find their form but we’ve got a lot of exciting young players. I think we’ll be competitive and I think we’ll be competitive in every tournament we play now. In fact, I think we’re going to have fun with England for the next 10, 12 years.”Lineker remains the ultimate football enthusiast. To talk with the 61-year-old about an event he describes as “the biggest thing going” is to rekindle an unfamiliar feeling, that of excitement for a tournament that has given off more bad vibes than it is possible to count. He uses language stronger than the Guardian will publish to describe the process that ended with Qatar becoming host, says “we are stuck with it” and promises the BBC’s opening night of coverage will be akin to “a mini-Panorama”. But he is supportive of Gareth Southgate, excited for Lionel Messi and ready to back Brazil.That Lineker has reasons to retain affection for Fifa’s quadrennial jamboree is self-evident: he is indelibly associated with some of the tournament’s most abiding moments. His hat-trick in Monterrey against Poland and the odds, the hand of God and the greatest goal of all time (he scored the consolation), the Golden Boot and a reprisal of that form four years later to take England to the edge of a World Cup final – “have a word” and all; it adds up. Lineker has done as much for the World Cup as it has done for him which, he acknowledges, is a lot.“Finishing with the Golden Boot in Mexico, six goals, top scorer, it changed my life,” he says. “I was having a decent career, I was scoring lots of goals for first Leicester and then Everton, but to do it in the World Cup catapults you onto a global stage. From being only recognised in a few places in England I was now known everywhere I went.”If 86 was personally transformative, Italia 90 went further becoming a “watershed moment” for football in this country, he says. “Politically it was a really difficult time for the country: there was concerns over hooligans travelling, Thatcher was talking about whether we should go or not. But we went and I think we then changed the perception of the sport. It wasn’t just a working man’s sport any more. Women were starting to get interested in football, the middle classes were starting to get interested in football, it was perhaps the seminal moment. After that we had the Taylor Report, then along came the Premier League and all of a sudden football was a better place.”Twenty-eight years later and another transference of energy from an England football team to the country at large occurred. After decades of disappointment, decadence and, ultimately, disconnect, Gareth Southgate led England’s men’s team to their third World Cup semi-final with a group that lacked stardust but won the affection of supporters. This, in turn, led to the England coach and his players becoming more engaged in the national conversation than the generations that had preceded them. They spoke about things that mattered to them and made the case for change. Their decision to take the knee before matches at 2021’s European Championship saw them win the moral argument for protesting against racial inequality over the government of the day.Players’ advocacy has consistently been met with criticism, and now the same individuals are under pressure to protest against the World Cup in Qatar. Lineker, whose political interventions on Twitter have earned him an army of critics, understands the bind they are in.“Players that speak out will be told to stick to football, players that don’t speak out will be told to speak out,” he says. “You can’t generally win as a footballer in these circumstances and a lot is expected of what are very young men. They earn huge amounts of money these days and often people don’t like that, but nobody seems to say anything about singers or F1 drivers. Most of the players around the England squad – Gareth is great around this as well – they do say the right things and I think they’ve represented our country really well.”This is a World Cup like no other.

The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.Lineker has occasionally – and notably – been known to show the edge of his tongue towards Southgate, being critical of the England manager’s conservative approach to tournament competition. After a 1-0 Nations League defeat by Italy in September, he tweeted: “I think Gareth Southgate’s tactical master plan of not giving us any hope in order not to kill us is working beautifully thus far.”In person, the BBC man and co-host with Cesc Fàbregas of a new World Cup podcast is more diplomatic and makes sure to be clear as to what he deems to be the baseline when it comes to the England manager. “I’ve put my views in there,” he says, “[but] I’m a strong supporter of Gareth and I think whatever happens he has absolutely earned the right to succeed or fail in this World Cup. He’s taken us to a semi-final of the World Cup, a final of the European championships. I would play more adventurously because I’m a striker, [but] history tells us that you probably need a degree of pragmatism to win the World Cup. I understand completely how difficult and thankless a task he’s got … unless he wins the thing.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballLineker’s favourites for the tournament are Brazil, both the most successful World Cup nation and a country that hasn’t seen success for two decades. “It’s been 20 years since a South American team won the World Cup and if you asked me to put my head on the block and say you’ve to pick someone I think I’d probably pick Brazil, slightly ahead of Argentina,” he says.The logic of a stacked squad leads him to plump for the Seleção, ahead of the individual genius of the man he calls the GOAT, Lionel Messi. The admiration Lineker has for his fellow sporting great is charming and another marker of his boy scout enthusiasm. Lineker says the 35-year-old doesn’t need a World Cup title to prove his greatness, but then “it would probably put any argument anyone has ever had to bed” so, “in that sense, probably he does”.Messi is in great form with PSG and playing in a system that suits him under Lionel Scaloni for Argentina, and Lineker says a desert triumph for the diminutive No 10 would be a fitting accolade late in his career. But as someone who has been there and been witness to much more World Cup history, Lineker is aware of the fine lines between sporting death and glory.“People talk about how Maradona must be better because he won the World Cup; well, I don’t think that’s quite the way you should judge things,” Lineker says. “For example Maradona sticks Burruchaga through against Germany late on, Burruchaga finishes [the third goal in Argentina’s 3-2 victory in the 86 final]. Messi sticks through Higuaín, he goes through, misses [against Germany in a 1-0 final defeat in 2014]. If Higuaín scores that, the debate is already gone. What I’m trying to say is: the greatest player in the world still needs a team.”How to Win a World Cup with Gary Lineker and Cesc Fàbregas is available to listen to on Audible"
87,Arsenal go five points clear at top after Martin Ødegaard double sinks Wolves,The Guardian,Ben Fisher at Molineux,2022-11-12T21:53:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/12/wolves-arsenal-premier-league-match-report,"In Germany they christen the team top of the Bundesliga at Christmas der Herbstmeister, the autumn champions. While Arsenal mirroring what, in effect, is tantamount to a claim to fame in the Premier League is practically meaningless to Mikel Arteta, it is a milestone that Arsenal have not managed since 2007 and, even if they have played only 14 games, it is increasingly difficult to quell the excitement around his vibrant team.Martin Ødegaard scored twice in victory at Wolves as Arsenal offered a reminder heading into the World Cup break that they are in undeniably rude health. Wolves, meanwhile, are bottom and badly need Julen Lopetegui to revive their miserable season.At lunchtime Arteta and his squad tuned into Manchester City’s shock defeat by Brentford, a result that guaranteed Arsenal would be No 1 at Christmas. What was the mood when Ivan Toney scored a 98th-minute winner? “As you can imagine,” Arteta said, failing to suppress his smile. He knows his team are in the conversation for the title.For Arsenal the challenge at kick-off was not only to admire the view at the summit but to return to winning ways and subsequently stretch their legs. Ødegaard’s double opened up a five-point lead at the top but Gabriel Magalhães, who was left out of the Brazil squad, and Gabriel Jesus, who made the cut, also starred in victory. “It is great to be where we are and we are enjoying the moment,” Arteta said. “Nobody expected us to be where we are and to win the amount of games we have.”Results elsewhere may have been kind but this game felt as if it was set up to test Arsenal. Granit Xhaka was replaced by Fábio Vieira after 15 minutes, the midfielder among the players left feeling queasy following the prematch meal. Ben White’s annoyance at a Wolves goal-kick and not an Arsenal corner being awarded midway through the first half led him to underarm the ball in the direction of the assistant referee Harry Lennard, earning him a ticking off from the referee, Stuart Attwell. Wolves, perhaps buoyed by Arsenal’s frustrations, seemed to grow in confidence.They were, however, aggrieved at the failure to be awarded an eighth-minute penalty when William Saliba clumsily bumped Gonçalo Guedes over in the box. “Why do we have VAR when they can’t make a decision?” said Steve Davis, who took charge of his boyhood club for the final time. “The point of it is a waste of time. He should have been sent off. It should have been a penalty. It’s a major gamechanger. I’m disappointed with the decision. We needed that break.”Lopetegui visited the Wolves training ground on Friday but officially begins work on Monday. He embarked on a pre-match lap of the pitch, beating his chest and giving supporters singing his name the thumbs up before taking his seat in the stands. Jeff Shi, the Wolves chairman, said eventually landing Lopetegui – he twice turned down the job, once in 2016 and more recently in the aftermath of Bruno Lage’s sacking because of his father’s ill-health – felt like destiny.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballArsenal scoring also felt somewhat inevitable. They had done so in every league game this season and, when Vieira picked up Jesus’s pass and slid the ball into the six-yard box, Ødegaard tapped in with Bukayo Saka queueing up behind him. “We don’t know what his limit is, like many of the kids we have,” Arteta said of Ødegaard, who would have scored again soon after the hour had Toti Gomes not hoovered up a delicious, weighted pass by Jesus.With 15 minutes to play it was game over after Ødegaard doubled his tally against a Wolves team that have mustered eight league goals all season, the worst attacking record in the division. Martinelli pinched the ball from the Wolves teenager Dexter Lembikisa and located Oleksandr Zinchenko, who drilled in a cross. Martinelli stabbed a shot at goal, prompting José Sá to save with his right boot, only for Ødegaard to smack the ball into the corner with his left. Arteta whirled his right hand around in celebration, another sweet victory secured. “We are top of the league,” crowed the Arsenal fans."
88,"This time England believe we can win World Cup, says Harry Maguire",The Guardian,David Hytner in Doha,2022-12-07T22:30:36Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/07/this-time-england-believe-we-can-win-world-cup-says-harry-maguire,"Harry Maguire frames it differently and it is some difference. His England teammates, when questioned in Qatar, have mostly said they can win the World Cup. It is the objective. They have not shied away from saying so. For Maguire, though, it goes beyond that. It is not only a target. As he prepares for Saturday night’s quarter-final against France, it is an obligation.“That’s the one thing I’d say is a lot different from the 2018 squad,” Maguire says. “I played when we got to the semi-final and a lot of the lads were happy. You knew that whatever happened in that semi-final [when they lost to Croatia], you’d go home and be classed as a hero; you’d get a good reception, everyone would be patting you on the back. Now there’s a belief that we’ve got to win this tournament.“Of course we know how tough it is going to be. There are probably five or six teams with the same belief. But in 2018 we probably weren’t one of those teams. Now there’s five or six who have that belief and we’re one of them.”This is a World Cup like no other.

Support our investigative journalism today.When considering Maguire or talking to him, it is impossible not to fixate on his mentality. Or, to put it another way, wonder how he copes with it all because, over the past year and a bit, Maguire has become a virtual by-word for calamity. That has to do something to a player, even one as long in the tooth as him.It was a horrible season for him last time out. Manchester United were surely the worst version of themselves since the late 1980s and Maguire was a big part of that, making grisly errors. He looked leaden-footed, his confidence on the floor. But as the captain, he almost became the face of the listing ship.Maguire’s substitution against Atlético Madrid in the Champions League was cheered by a section of the Old Trafford crowd. For England, meanwhile, he was jeered at Wembley during the friendly against the Ivory Coast. Sticks and stones, perhaps. But then came the bomb threat to his family home, which was beyond the pale.This season the abuse has not been as bad and maybe it is because he has not been seen as often. Dropped after the first two games by the new United manager, Erik ten Hag, Maguire has started only three times since – all at Old Trafford; Real Sociedad (Europa League defeat), West Ham (Premier League win), Aston Villa (Carabao Cup win).Maguire was in at the outset for England in late September against Italy and Germany – he was poor in the second tie – and after that was unavailable for three weeks or so because of a thigh injury. When he departed for the World Cup, he was United’s fourth-choice centre-half and there were plenty of people who did not want him in the lineup when England got underway against Iran. So how does he cope?“First and foremost, I listen to people around me like my family and friends, my teammates, the staff here,” Maguire says. “I know how valued I am, I feel it within the camp. That gives me great belief. I also go back to my past memories and performances at tournaments. In the summer of last year I was in the Euros team of the tournament. I know what I’m capable of.”It has to be hard to blot out all of the noise. Maguire cannot live under a rock. Last week he was even ridiculed in the Ghanaian parliament when an MP denigrated the vice-president as the “economic Maguire”, accusing him of being a liability.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football“You pick up bits and bobs and maybe my family read things more than me,” Maguire says. “I tell them to stay off social media – maybe they don’t because it’s a habit for most people these days. But I’m 29 years old, I’m the captain of Man United and I’ve made 52 appearances for my country. I’m doing everything I always wanted to do.“During a career there’s only probably Lionel Messi and Cristiano [Ronaldo] who’ve not had a dip. There’s no way, especially with all the scrutiny that is on defences these days, you’re not going to have dips. It’s how you bounce back from them.”Maguire has had a good World Cup so far, starting all four of England’s ties, although he did have shaky moments during the early stages of the last-16 win against Senegal. He has felt the support of not only Southgate but the travelling fans, making light of his lack of regular football much as he did going into the last Euros; back then he was out for six weeks with an ankle problem. He has also received a couple of “well done” messages from Ten Hag.“As a player you want to play and this is the first season I’ve really sat on a bench in a few games,” Maguire says. “But I’ll fight to get my place back [at United]. I did manage to play the 90 minutes against West Ham and Villa after my thigh injury and I felt like I was coming into a little bit of form. You want to play in your rhythm and I’m glad I got the first few World Cup games out of the way. I’m in a rhythm of playing now. I’m in a good place.”This is not a redemption story. Not yet, anyway. The fear continues to lurk that Maguire could be exposed against France, particularly by the pace of Kylian Mbappé. But just imagine if Maguire could summon a command performance in victory. This is his life – ever on the end of a precipice. How does he cope? All told, pretty remarkably."
89,Heartbroken Australia bow out with heads held high - Reuters,Reuters,,2022-12-04T01:27:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/heartbroken-australia-bow-out-with-heads-held-high-2022-12-04/,"DOHA, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Australia's fairytale finally came to an end on Saturday but the unfancied and unheralded squad that headed to Qatar a few weeks ago will go home to a hero's welcome after going as far at a World Cup as any Socceroos team has ever been.They fought to the bitter end in their 2-1 loss in the last 16 against Argentina on Saturday -- their fourth game in 12 days -- but were just unable to snatch an equaliser that would have taken the match to extra time.""I just hope that everyone back in Australia really respects what we've done,"" said coach Graham Arnold. ""I've got to be very, very proud of the boys. Just so grateful at the effort they've put in for me.""Indefatigable running, cohesiveness and pure Aussie grit had earned them back-to-back victories at the World Cup finals for the first time, surpassing even the hallowed 'Golden Generation' side of 2006.This squad was not made up largely of English Premier League starters, however, but was a hotchpotch of A-League stalwarts, bench players and reserves in Europe's less glamorous leagues along with a couple plying their trade in Asia.They just scraped into the tournament via two playoffs and departed for Qatar with the lowest expectations of any of the six Australia squads who have embarked on World Cup finals campaigns since 1974.They made a brilliant start with a Craig Goodwin goal inside nine minutes of their opener with France but the doubters were soon vindicated as the world champions sidestepped Australia's central press and replied with four quality goals for a 4-1 win.Something was brewing, however, and the Socceroos made their mark in their second fixture against a Tunisia side that had held Denmark to a goalless draw and would later beat a second-string France team.A Mitch Duke header of the highest quality put Australia ahead and fierce 11-man defence from the forwards right through to skipper Mat Ryan in goal kept them there for a 1-0 win.That would probably have been enough to take them home with faces saved but they were by no means done and a fine Mathew Leckie goal and some equally ferocious rearguard action saw them past Denmark 1-0 and into the knockout stages.In a country where football struggles for profile among more popular sports codes, the crowds that gathered early on Sunday morning in front of big screens for the Argentina match were alone a sign of success.On an individual level, young players like central defender Harry Souttar and Goodwin have proved they can mix it with the best in the world.Arnold, an assistant to Guus Hiddink in 2006, will rightly take huge credit for the campaign, having forged a tight-knit group together over a long and sometimes rocky qualifying campaign.His much-voiced concern is that his method, refreshing the core of the team with players he coached when in charge of the under-23 team for the Tokyo Olympics, was a quick fix when what was needed was root-and-branch reform of player pathways.""I have massive concerns for the future,"" he said before the Denmark match.""The Socceroos are just the icing on the cake. That icing, whether it tastes good or bad, the most important thing is ingredients.""And the ingredients are junior development and junior national teams. If that's not right, the icing will not taste very good.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.As the World Cup reaches a climax in Qatar, drama on the pitch has partially eclipsed human rights controversies that dogged the Gulf Arab state since it was first chosen to host the competition 12 years ago.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

90,Analysis: Manchester United's owners see escape hatch in soccer club deal boom - Reuters.com,Reuters,,2022-11-24T07:03:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/manchester-uniteds-owners-see-escape-hatch-soccer-club-deal-boom-2022-11-24/,"LONDON/NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - A sale of Manchester United Plc could provide the soccer club's controlling shareholders, the Glazer family, a lucrative exit from an investment that has languished over the past decade and drawn the ire of millions of soccer fans.Deals for European football clubs this year, beginning with the sanctions-driven sale of Chelsea Football Club by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in May, have fetched top dollar.It's these rich valuations that have motivated the Glazers to formally put Manchester United up for sale, according to two people familiar with the matter.The family, which made its fortune in real estate, retail and healthcare and also owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bought the team for 790 million pounds ($939.07 million) in 2005. A sale at valuations commensurate with deals like Chelsea would yield a profit of several billion dollars, the sources said.The sources, however, warned that the Glazers, who own two-thirds of Manchester United through dual-class shares, may ultimately choose to sell only a minority stake or decide against any transaction.A Manchester United spokesperson declined to comment.The Glazers' decision to launch a formal sale process now ends years of the family's resistance to pressure from fans to divest.Many of the club's supporters have complained that the Glazers' debt-laden buyout of the team starved it of funds and that the owners needed to spend more to attract and retain talent and win trophies. Those complaints were aired again this month by superstar player Cristiano Ronaldo, who parted ways with Manchester United for the second time.""The Glazers, they don't care about the club or professional sport,"" Ronaldo said in an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV on Nov. 14.Spokespeople for the six members of the Glazer family that are major Manchester United shareholders could not be reached for comment.Before the announcement of the sale process on Tuesday, Manchester United's shares were hovering around $13, below the team's initial public offer price of $14 in 2012.Meanwhile, deals for football clubs are attracting lofty valuations.In May, Chelsea was acquired by investment group led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital for a purchase price of $3.1 billion and an additional $2.6 billion in future investments. That deal valued Chelsea at 5.7 times its revenue for the last financial year, investment bankers said.In August, investment firm group RedBird Capital acquired Italian soccer team AC Milan for 1.2 billion euros ($1.2 billion), a record for a European club outside of the English Premier League. More deals are in the works, with Manchester United arch rival Liverpool Football Club also exploring a sale.The value of acquisitions and major stakebuilding in the sports industry has risen to 9.6 billion pounds this year, up from 1.8 billion pounds last year, according to a report by law firm RPC last month.At a 5.7 revenue multiple, Manchester United would fetch about $3.4 billion, a 41% premium to where the club's shares were trading in New York on Tuesday before news of the sale process hit.Analysts say the team is likely to fetch a higher multiple than that. Chelsea only has a fraction of Manchester United's followers. Manchester United has a bigger stadium and is more profitable. Despite going five years without having won a trophy, it consistently produces annual cash flow of about $100 million, making it a safe investment.""We continue to believe that Manchester United's fundamentals justify a premium to clubs sold earlier this year,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a research note.Many well-heeled buyers are fueling deals for football clubs. Private equity firms are attracted to the clubs' cash flow and brand value. And sports teams are viewed by many billionaires as the ultimate status symbol.In August, Elon Musk tweeted: ""I'm buying Manchester United ur welcome"" only to then clarify he meant it as a joke. A spokesperson for Musk did not respond to a request for comment.Even before the announcement of a sale process, Manchester United had received overtures from at least one potential acquirer: British billionaire and a long-standing fan of the club, Jim Ratcliffe, Reuters previously reported.A spokesperson for Ratcliffe declined to comment.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.As the World Cup reaches a climax in Qatar, drama on the pitch has partially eclipsed human rights controversies that dogged the Gulf Arab state since it was first chosen to host the competition 12 years ago.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

91,Wales must play with handbrake off to earn overdue win against old foes England | Elis James,The Guardian,Elis James,2022-11-29T07:30:20Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/nov/29/wales-must-play-with-handbrake-off-to-earn-overdue-win-against-old-foes-england,"Wales had hoped for exotic World Cup opposition but must now aim to beat neighbours for the first time in 38 yearsI watched Wales’s second game of the World Cup at Clwb Ifor Bach, Cardiff. The same venue I saw the Strokes, Afrika Bambaataa and Roots Manuva play in my 20s, but there has never been a headliner at Clwb like Wales v Iran. As I walked through Cardiff city centre last Friday morning I saw pubs fill and football fans greet each other, alongside office workers purchasing that pillar of the 21st-century Welsh economy, the Boots Meal Deal. People having a pint at 9.35am because Wales are playing in the World Cup against opposition we haven’t met since 1978. We have always wanted this.After the 1-1 draw with the USA in the opening game, fans hoped for a repeat of Euro 2020: a nervy stalemate in the first match against Switzerland followed by Bale and Ramsey rolling back the years to outclass Turkey and see us reach the last 16; Gareth and Aaron adding to the evidence that there are in fact two real Princes of Wales. We were all to be disappointed. A deserved win for Iran as a lacklustre Wales cracked in the final two minutes of stoppage time. Even a victory in the final group game may not be enough.And so, on to England. Many, if not most, of our fans were disappointed when we were drawn in the same group as our next-door neighbours. If the European Championship is about big international derbies and the continent’s heavyweights being pitted against each other, part of the World Cup’s allure is new teams, strange fixtures, different experiences, something that can’t be provided by the familiarity of Luke Shaw and Mason Mount. Before last Monday night the only competitive games Wales had played against non‑European opposition were against Mexico and Brazil in 1958. Declan Rice was not part of the plan in this global festival of football.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.Seeing such recognisable faces on the pitch is jarring at a major tournament, lending a Sky Super Sunday feel to a game taking place in a different time zone, both on and off the pitch. Some countries in South America might have a bigger problem with hooliganism. German fans might be more organised, the phenomenon of the tifo might make the Italians more colourful. But when it comes to one of the most dreaded sights and sounds in football, the synchronised jeer and outstretching of arms culminating in a wanker sign as the opposition’s best player drills a goalscoring opportunity wide of the post, England fans are undoubtedly world class. As seasoned watchers of the Premier League, we are acutely aware of the talent Gareth Southgate has at his disposal. Wales need to play with the handbrake off. We’re hoping England don’t do the same.England and Wales in football is a strange rivalry. We share a border but the English are more bothered by Germany, France or Argentina, and historically Scotland. It lacks the class element of rugby union, where English former public schoolkids take on the largely state-educated working‑class Wales team. What it does share with rugby union is an imbalance of resources. England is a country of 57 million people. Wales has a population smaller than that of the east Midlands. Among football fans there is far less of the “as long as we beat the English” attitude that has been prevalent in Welsh rugby, something that makes more sense when a sport’s primary focus is an annual European competition played between the same six teams.Wales haven’t beaten England at football since 1984, in the final season of the much-maligned British Home Championship. A 20-year-old Mark Hughes, with the fresh face of an angel and thighs of a powerlifter, scored the winner just 17 minutes into his debut, in the final year of a tournament that provided the Football Association of Wales with an enormous amount of its annual revenue, but that the English (and Scottish) FA no longer wanted to play. Since then, it has been played six, lost six.There was a very British element to Welsh football when I started going in the 1990s. Like today, lots of our fans supported English teams. A lot of the songs we sung were the same. The four big Welsh clubs – Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County and Wrexham – were fully signed-up sufferers of the “English disease” and had significant hooligan problems. But this has changed substantially since I first fell in love with following Wales in 1990.The FAW has announced it would like the team to be known as Cymru, rather than Wales. Our fans now sing in Welsh and English. If part of the aim for this World Cup was to raise the profile of Wales globally, it actually helps we’re playing England.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballNo one can be forgiven for thinking we’re not a country in our own right any more. Our cricketers represent England (and Wales). Our athletes compete in the Olympics for Team GB. International football matters because it tells the world that Wales exists, in a sport that globally is more popular than democracy. Tom Jones might have been introduced on stage in America as a singer from England, but no one is under any illusions as to where Gareth Bale is from. Our greatest player is now under huge pressure to provide us with one more moment of magic.Apart from the rare occasions we’ve been drawn against England in qualification campaigns, or in the group stage of Euro 2016, our paths haven’t crossed very often since 1984. We have more historical grievances with Scotland, having failed to qualify against them for the 1978 and 1986 World Cup finals. We have been drawn so often against Belgium in recent years I am now more familiar with their starting XI than I am with some of the CDs I still keep in my glove compartment. But we need to beat England in Doha to stand any chance of progressing at this tournament. Winning against a team we have beaten 14 times since 1879, in our first World Cup finals for 64 years. It’s just another game.Elis James has donated his fee for this column to Amnesty International, which is campaigning for Qatar and Fifa to establish a compensation fund for migrant workers."

93,‘The defeats always stay’: Jordan Henderson reflects on near misses,The Guardian,David Hytner in Doha,2022-12-02T22:30:27Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/02/jordan-henderson-england-liverpool-near-misses,"The Liverpool and England midfielder on penalty agony, his winning mentality and ‘feeling a little old’ after six tournamentsJordan Henderson cannot help it. Put simply, it is a part of what makes him who he is. The Liverpool and England midfielder feels the setbacks way more keenly than the triumphs; he holds on to them so tightly that they never truly leave him.“The defeats always stay,” Henderson says. “I can remember them more than the wins. They hurt the most. That’s the part where you want to change things and put them right but you never get rid of that feeling.”Henderson is acknowledging two specific losses – the first with Liverpool in the 2018 Champions League final to Real Madrid; the other with England in the Euro 2020 final to Italy on penalties. But there are others. Liverpool narrowly missing out on the Premier League title to Manchester City in 2018-19, despite finishing with 97 points. The second Champions League final defeat to Real last season.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.In his recently released autobiography, Henderson rakes over another grave – his penalty shootout miss against Colombia at the 2018 World Cup. He describes the moment in vivid detail, how he felt his world collapse, his mind overrun by negativity.“All I was thinking was: ‘I’ll never go back to England – that’s it,’” Henderson writes. “My England career? Over. Life as it exists? Over. How could I go back? I’d let the whole nation down.”Fortunately for Henderson, England would come back to win the last-16 shootout but what he did next was revealing. After a recovery session the following day, he stayed out alone to practise penalties, obsessively, to the point where the assistant manager, Steve Holland, had to yell at him to get inside.There was almost a horrible sting. When Henderson woke the next day, he felt a tightness in his groin. He had injured himself taking penalties. Fortunately, the damage was not serious enough to rule him out of the quarter-final or semi-final.The story shines a light on Henderson’s mentality. Fall short, dig deeper, be better prepared. It feels as if the 32-year-old has always been questioned. The other day, his Liverpool and England teammate Trent Alexander-Arnold called him “criminally underrated”. How does Henderson feel about that? “I’m not sure,” he replies. “I’ve been asked this throughout my career.”What Henderson does is he overcomes. After the first Champions League final defeat, he returned to the showpiece the following season and led his team to victory over Tottenham. After the near miss in the title race in 2018-19, he and Liverpool won the thing the next season. And now here he is, at a third World Cup and sixth major tournament for England seeking to go one better than at the last European Championship.“I suppose you could see similarities [to Liverpool] in terms of getting so close and just failing at the last bit until we ended up winning,” Henderson says. “I don’t like to make comparisons with other teams, and especially club football, but I do feel like when you go through experiences together, especially good ones, but at the end you don’t get what you want, that can make you really stronger as a team.“I keep my runners-up medals. Not many players get to cup finals so I’ll always respect the process of getting there. But when you just miss out on your dream then it can hurt a lot and that is what drives you to get better.”First things first: Senegal. There is definitely a view in England that the team will beat the reigning African champions on Sunday and play a quarter-final against France, particularly as Henderson’s former Liverpool teammate Sadio Mané is out injured for Senegal.It is absolutely not the view within the England camp. Henderson was a part of the squad at Euro 2016 when Iceland were supposed to be brushed aside in the last 16 en route to a quarter-final meeting with France. Everybody knows how that worked out. But the Iceland debacle is not why Henderson dismisses the threat of complacency. It is because of his laser-like focus, his battle-hardened realism.“It won’t be a danger for us as a team,” Henderson says. “We can say they are missing Sadio Mané but they got into the knockout stages without him and they will be feeling confident. They are used to winning. We have just got to keep focused on what needs doing, not get too carried away, not look too far ahead.”Henderson says that a sixth tournament appearance makes him feel “a little bit old”. Only three England players have previously done six on the spin – Sol Campbell, Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. But Henderson’s energy, as much as anything else, was the standout feature of his performance against Wales in the final group tie when he won his 72nd cap.Will he start against Senegal? Or will it be Mason Mount? Gareth Southgate’s decision will shape the dynamics of the midfield and the manager knows what he can expect from Henderson. Selflessness, experience and relentless hard work.“I try to cover a lot of ground,” Henderson says. “High-intensity runs to put pressure on the ball and runs off the ball when we’re trying to get in behind or get on the ball. I try to inject a bit of intensity.”One final thought. Would Henderson volunteer if it went to penalties? He does not miss a beat. “Always,” he replies."
94,Cat-ar 2022: England players to adopt ‘Dave’ the cat after leaving World Cup,The Guardian,Luke McLaughlin,2022-12-11T14:54:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/11/qatar-world-cup-cat-england-kyle-walker-john-stones,"England’s footballers are coming home without the World Cup trophy but were not entirely empty-handed on leaving their training base in Al Wakrah on Sunday.The defenders Kyle Walker and John Stones, who both started for Gareth Southgate’s team in Saturday’s 2-1 defeat by France, befriended a stray tabby cat during their four-week stay in Qatar.Stones named their handsome new feline companion Dave, while Walker had said they planned to adopt the cat and bring him home to England should the Three Lions ultimately triumph.Despite that dream again failing to become a reality, it seems the players had become too fond of Dave to say a final farewell when they departed Al Wakrah.This is a World Cup like no other.

Support our investigative journalism today.The cat was transported to a local veterinary clinic for tests and vaccinations and will spend four months in quarantine before what is presumably a free transfer to Manchester City – or to the care of Stones or Walker, who both play for the Premier League champions.“They’re still undecided as who’s having him but he’s going back,” said a woman tasked with taking Dave to the vet’s on Sunday, in a video posted by Rich McCarthy on Twitter.“He was just there one day so we’ve just adopted him, me and Stonesy,” Walker told the FA’s official media channel during England’s World Cup campaign. “Dave is welcome to the table ... Some people really don’t like the cat, but I love him.”“First day we got there ... Dave pops out,” Stones said. “Every night he’s sat there waiting for his food.”Walker also told journalists that Dave was involved in a fight with a rival cat before the last-eight defeat by Les Bleus. “Dave’s fine, thank you for asking,” Walker revealed.Dave is not the only cat to have grabbed the media’s attention in Qatar. Before their quarter-final defeat by Croatia, Brazil’s press conference was invaded by a cat that sat in view of the cameras next to the forward Vinícius Junior, before being thrown off the table by a team official."
95,‘I felt betrayed’: Ronaldo aims broadside at Ten Hag and Manchester United,The Guardian,PA Media,2022-11-13T22:46:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/13/i-felt-betrayed-ronaldo-aims-broadside-at-ten-hag-and-manchester-united,"Cristiano Ronaldo claims he has been “betrayed” by Manchester United and believes they are trying to force him out of the club.The Portugal forward said that head coach Erik ten Hag and others want him out of Old Trafford in an excerpt of a 90-minute interview released on the Piers Morgan Uncensored Twitter feed.When asked by Morgan if United’s hierarchy were trying to force him out of the club, Ronaldo, 37, said: “Yes, not only the coach, but another two or three guys around the club. I felt betrayed.”When quizzed again if senior club executives were trying to oust him, Ronaldo said: “I don’t care. People should listen to the truth.“Yes I felt betrayed and I felt like some people don’t want me here, not only this year but last year too.”The forward was banished from first-team training last month by Ten Hag and excluded from the draw at Chelsea as punishment for refusing to come on against Tottenham and walking down the tunnel before the end of the match.He returned to the fold – and scored his third of the season – in the 3-0 Europa League victory over Sheriff and played in the subsequent Premier League games against West Ham and Aston Villa, though he was absent from the matchday squad for Sunday’s game against Fulham.When Morgan asked Ronaldo about current United boss Ten Hag, the Portuguese said: “I don’t have respect for him because he doesn’t show respect for me. If you don’t have respect for me, I’m never gonna have respect for you.”Ronaldo was also “witheringly scornful” about former United team-mate Wayne Rooney over criticism the former had received for refusing to appear for United as a substitute during a recent game against Tottenham.Writing in the Sun, Morgan revealed Ronaldo said: “I don’t know why he criticises me so badly … probably because he finished his career and I’m still playing at a high level. I’m not going to say that I’m looking better than him. Which is true …”In further clips from the interview, released by TalkTV and due to be broadcast at 8pm (GMT) on Wednesday and Thursday, Ronaldo claimed United had not progressed as a club since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballRonaldo said: “I don’t know what is going on but since Sir Alex Ferguson left I saw no evolution in the club, the progress was zero.“For example, we have an interesting point that how the club as Manchester United after (they) sack Ole (Gunnar Solskjaer), they buy – they bring (in), sports director Ralf Rangnick, which is something that nobody understands.“This guy is not even a coach. A bigger club like Manchester United brings (a) sports director – surprised not only me but all the world, you know.“Nothing changed. Surprisingly. Not only the pool, the jacuzzi, even the gym … Even some points, the technology, the kitchen, the chefs, which is, I appreciate, lovely persons.“They stopped in a time, which surprised me a lot. I thought I will see different things … different, as I mentioned before, technology, infrastructure. But unfortunately, we see many things that I used to see when I was 20, 21, 23. So, it surprised me a lot.”"
96,‘It’s coming home’: Indian expats welcome England to team hotel in Qatar,The Guardian,Sean Ingle in Doha,2022-11-15T20:38:05Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/15/its-coming-home-indian-expats-welcome-england-to-team-hotel-in-qatar,"England’s footballers were greeted by the bizarre but joyous sight of hundreds of Indian expats serenading them with “It’s coming home” as they arrived at their hotel in Qatar on Tuesday evening.As the England coach pulled into the five-star Souq Al Wakra hotel just south of Doha, the fans banged drums, blew trumpets and even crashed through a police barrier to get a better view. There were loud cheers for the captain, Harry Kane, and an even bigger one for Gareth Southgate, especially when the manager turned to wave.There were also familiar chants of “England! England!” as well as the rather unusual “Southgate is our super coach! Sterling is our super star! Pickford is our super keeper”.It was another sign that this World Cup, the first in the Middle East and the first to be held in winter, will be very different to the 21 tournaments that have come before it.There have been suggestions on social media that some locals are being paid by the Qataris to add a dash of spice, but the half a dozen or so fans the Guardian spoke to promised they were the real deal. They insisted they made their own jerseys, bought their own tickets to the games and supported England having grown up watching players such as David Beckham.They were also happy to talk about the latest developments in the Premier League – and were clearly unhappy that a Scandinavian newspaper at the weekend had questioned their authenticity.This is a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.Sajidh, a 29-year-old mechanical engineer who did not want to give his full name, described suggestions that he and the others were receiving cash to be cheerleaders as “fake news”. He said:“None of us is getting paid. We are diehard England fans.“My favourite player was Beckham but now it is [Bukayo] Saka. If someone offered to pay us to support England we would turn them down. We are genuine supporters. Many of us grew up watching Beckham and Michael Owen. Our love is to this team.”Another fan, Niyas, from Kerala, estimated that there were 700,000 fans in his region back home and he showed the Guardian an 80ft cardboard cutout of Kane and a mural of the England team in his home state. He also showed a WhatsApp group of supporters with nearly 1,000 members.“We made these England tops ourselves,” he said. “No one gave them to us. Argentina is the most supported team among Indians in Qatar, followed by Brazil. But then it is England.”As the England squad touched down, Kane insisted everyone was match fit and ready for the first game against Iran on Monday. “It’s going to be massive,” he said.“I remember when we were out in Russia in our own little bubble. We saw all the videos from back home going crazy – it makes a big difference, it motivates us to be successful.“We want to make the fans proud and happy. Of course, there will be some in the stadiums – we always have great support – but most will be at home and we just want to make them proud.”"
