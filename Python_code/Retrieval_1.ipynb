    "Webscraping refers to the extraction of data from a website. This information is collected and then exported into a format that is more useful, perhaps a spreadsheet. Of course, we could just copy and paste this information manually into a spreadsheet, but that's time-consuming and unreasonable if we want to extract large amounts of data. Instead, we can use Python webscraping packages to access the information we want and display it in a logical format.\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for 'Application programming interface', and refers to a mechanism that allows two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocals. Basically, it allows two applications to talk to each other. For instance, think of your Weather app on your phone, this app software \"talks\" to the weather bureau's software system which contains the daily weather data. The result of this conversation is daily weather updates on your phone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both webscraping (as a process) and APIs (as a set of procedures and protocals) share the same goal: to access web data. The former allows you to extract data from any website via scraping software, whilst the latter gives you direct access to the data you want. In this notebook I'll be using a combination of the two."

    "So before I can even begin to think about webscraping, I need to locate some relevant data. I could just type \"women's football WSL\" into google and click on each individual link and try to scrape this data... but again, that's a) time-consuming b) uncreative. Instead, I did a brief google search \"Scrape news articles Python\" and came across NewsAPI. This API returns search results for current and historic news articles, and the results include information on: title, author, source, date, and url of the news article. It also allows you to input multiple terms so that you can grab as many relevant links as you can! \n",

There is a duality to the problem: some players are playing too much football and some too little, and both scenarios likely affect the chance of injury.',\n",

The sacking forced him to pause and consider his options, but also reflect on what had happened. It is fair to say he feels happy and appreciated at Burnley whereas that wasn’t always the case at Leicester.',\n",
       "  'He describes a few everyday scenarios that, he feels, are the difference between the clubs and how they integrate the women’s team. “Myself and the striker Courtney Willis were doing a one-to-one analysis session in the men’s first team analysis room and the men’s assistant coach, Craig Bellamy, walked in. You just think: ‘Oh shoot, I gotta get out.’',\n",
       "  '“You automatically think there’s a hierarchy, but he’s just: ‘How long are you going to be mate? Don’t leave on my account, if you’re going to be another half an hour I’ll just go and get another room.’ Then, he sat there and went through a couple of clips with me and Courtney. It was just class.',\n",
       "  '“Another time I was printing up some kit and the men’s manager, Vincent Kompany, was in the kit room with me, just sat there chatting while I was doing it. It’s these little moments that show you a club that’s really truly together. I never ever had that feeling at Leicester and I don’t think many clubs genuinely have that feeling.”',\n",
       "  'What made the exit from Leicester harder was that so many of his family were or had been part of the side’s rise. His sister Holly was captain and their father, Rohan, used to be the chairman. Jonathan’s other sister Jade is, as general manager, the only remaining Morgan at the club.',\n",
       "  'The fear for Leicester was perhaps the nepotistic image the Morgan involvement gave, but as a family the Morgans invested heavily in the building of the club from the bottom up, both financially and time-wise. Morgan and his father’s business financed Leicester all the way up to the Championship-winning season.',\n",
       "  '“We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of pounds over those years. If you look around now you see a wealth of players that came through our club and are doing well in other clubs in the Midlands. We’ve probably held up the Midlands from a player pathway point of view. We were just a family club,” says Morgan.',\n",
       "  '“When I first started we had nothing, it was nothing. I always heard what people thought: ‘He got there because his dad took over’, that type of thing.',\n",
       "  '“It is true, my dad gave me the opportunity originally. But he didn’t do the coaching, he didn’t do the tactics, he didn’t go through badges and get the licences. So that hurt.',\n",
       "  '“Holly as a player got it, too: ‘She’s only captain because of her brother.’ No one really took into consideration how that affected us. We just had to smile and put on a strong face because that was just the position we were in.”',\n",
       "  'After all the success, things changed, Morgan feels, when Leicester took full control of the women’s team in 2020, just after they had won promotion to the Super League. Morgan was sacked after eight winless games at the start of the 2021-22 season and he has the feeling that his family’s presence was “a ticking timebomb from the moment that Leicester took over”.',\n",
       "  'Being forced out was hard. “It was a horrible time,” he says. “We’re all clever enough to know when you’re wanted somewhere and when you’re not wanted. Even during the Championship season, it was very, very difficult. Without going into too much detail, we had little targets set for our first year in the WSL that were really unattainable.

       "  '“A lot of [the talk about support for black and ethnic minority managers] is lip service,” he says. “I don’t really talk too much about it because it’s such a polarising topic and people just either support you or they just go straight against you when you talk about it.

       "  \"Scheuer's earliest full coaching job came in 2010 at Bahlinger SC, an amateur regional league team formed almost a century ago in an agricultural area with a population of little more than 4,000.\",\n",
       "  \"It was the start of a career that has taken in record points hauls, a near-invincible title win and an eight-goal thriller with Chelsea in the Women's Champions League semi-finals.\",\n",
       "  'Now the first German manager in the WSL has his sights on transforming Brighton & Hove Albion.',\n",
       "  \"As a teenager, Scheuer had been a trainee at SC Freiburg under then youth coach Christian Streich, whose current 11-year reign as manager of the club's men's team is by far the longest in the Bundesliga.\",\n",
       "  'Scheuer never appeared for Freiburg and spent most of his playing days with Bahlinger, but he was inspired by meeting Streich again at a Christmas party years later.',\n",
       "  'Streich was able to tell Scheuer exactly when he worked with him, his position and subsequent clubs - and Scheuer resolved to make such meticulousness a hallmark of his own.',\n",
       "  '\"Jens did everything at this club,\" Dennis Buhrer, the current Bahlinger manager who Scheuer signed as a player in 2011, told BBC Sport.',\n",
       "  '\"As well as being the coach, he brought the balls, did the video analysis, everything. At a small club in a small village, it\\'s difficult. But for his development, it was very good.',\n",
       "  '\"Jens has a lot of ideas about football. Outside of training, he is always thinking about football.',\n",
       "  '\"He is a motivator because he wants to win every time. I learned from him that I want to win every training game and every match at the weekend.',\n",
       "  '\"We won the first game under him 11-1. Then we thought we were the best club in the division. A lot was expected of us - too much.\"',\n",

       "  'He has admitted that he discounted working in the women\\'s game after seeing a farcical handball go unpunished during the 2011 World Cup, then felt \"immediately annoyed\" for being \"so negative\" when he watched Freiburg women play.',\n",
       "  'Scheuer became a Frauen-Bundesliga manager for the first time when Freiburg appointed him in 2015, leading a team including Germany forward Lina Magull to third place - their highest ever finish - in 2017-18, as well as the DFB-Pokal cup final a year later.',\n",
       "  \"When Bayern Munich secured his services, Scheuer oversaw the end of Wolfsburg's four-year stranglehold on the title.\",\n",
       "  \"Bayern had finished eight points behind Wolfsburg in Scheuer's first season in charge. By the end of his second, they held a 19-goal superiority over the vanquished champions, scoring 82 times and conceding nine while losing once in 22 matches.\",\n",

       "  '\"It\\'s a big chance for him to do everything, every day, every hour for football. It\\'s exactly his thing.\"',\n",
       "  \"Scheuer has learned to relax, says Buhrer. The 44-year-old enjoys mountain walks, being a self-confessed bad loser at tennis and occasional glasses of wine - although much of his recent spare time appears to have been focused on Brighton's status as the WSL's most porous side.\",\n",
       "  'The Seagulls made four signings in four days at the start of January, bringing in defenders Zoe Morse and Guro Bergsvand alongside midfielders Dejana Stefanovic and Brianna Visalli.',\n",
       "  'Scheuer wants \"deep conversations\" and \"close connections\" with his players, who will be used to his high-intensity sessions by the time of a kind-looking first fixture for their new manager at bottom side Leicester on Sunday.',\n",
       "  'He is also preoccupied by changing the culture of the club, so that dropping points against the likes of Chelsea and Arsenal would be considered a cause for profound dissatisfaction.',\n",
       "  'Victory over Chelsea, Scheuer has said, is a priority - and he is only half-joking because of the painful memory of his last meeting with the WSL leaders.',\n",

       "  'Once again, there are renewed calls from players, fans and managers for more research into why this type of injury is more prevalent in female footballers than male. ',\n",
       "  'England striker Chloe Kelly has said the \"fear\" and \"negativity\" around ACL injuries \"needs changing\". So what is being done to try and reduce the risk?',\n",
       "  'Research has long suggested that ACL injuries - the most serious kind of knee damage - are more prevalent in female footballers, with estimates ranging from two to eight times more likely than in male.',\n",
       "  \"Dr Katrine Okholm Kryger, a senior lecturer in sports medicine at St Mary's University in London who specialises in football, said recent discussions have focused on whether the injury risk is sex related - the female anatomy and hormones, or whether it could be gender related - the way female athletes are raised and managed compared to male athletes.\",\n",
       "  '\"I think there\\'s some truth in all of these areas,\" she said.',\n",
       "  '\"We have to be really careful when we talk about this in women\\'s football because there is a tendency within research and within the media of being like \\'oh, women are so unstable, fragile, because of their anatomy, their hormonal fluctuations\\' but we haven\\'t proven that is the cause of these injuries.',\n",

       "  '1. Anatomy/biomechanics',\n",
       "  \"The physical differences between men and women, such as women generally having wider hips, which increase the leg's angle into the knee, and under-developed muscles which prevent the knee from turning in upon landing, have been the subject of research looking at whether that increases the risk.\",\n",
       "  'However, Dr Okholm Kryger says that there is no strong evidence from the research that this is the main risk factor.',\n",
       "  '2. Hormones',\n",
       "  'The role of the menstrual cycle has also been put forward as potentially making females more predisposed to injury at certain times. During the menstrual cycle when oestrogen is elevated, which usually happens in the second week, it can affect the stability of joints, making them looser and more lax. ',\n",
       "  'However, Dr Okholm Kryger is keen to stress that there is a lack of research to support whether this increases the risk of injury. \"There has been some not very high quality research done on the relationship between the menstrual cycle and the ACL risk,\" she said. \"It\\'s very difficult because you need either continuous blood samples or saliva.',\n",
       "  '\"Most of it is done predicting where in the phase women are, based on when their period starts, most studies haven\\'t actually measured hormonal levels in the body. So it\\'s all predictions. When you put all the data together it shows very little difference.\"',\n",
       "  'Dr Okholm Kryger also pointed out players often report that they are more likely to get injured when they are on their period at the start of their cycle, but actually the risk should be higher during ovulation.',\n",

       "  'A 2021 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicineexternal-link suggested looking at the influence of gender - pointing at external factors such as access to training, sport science, facilities and rehabilitation. ',\n",

       "  'Other gender disparities highlighted by Dr Okholm Kryger include the pitches used in the WSL compared to the Premier League and the design of football kit such as boots. Women move and run in a different way to men and yet the length of studs on boots are designed around male movement and traction, she pointed out, which increases the risk of women getting their boot stuck in the surface and an injury being caused.  ',\n",
       "  '4. Workload',\n",
       "  \"As women's football grows rapidly, the amount of games and the level of intensity is also growing quickly, which is leading to increasing concern among managers and players in the game.\",\n",
       "  '\"Obviously you can do everything to put the players in the best condition possible but with the volume of games and the limited recovery time at the moment, it\\'s difficult to do anything about it,\" said Dr Okholm Kryger. ',\n",

       "  '\"In the female game, while the facility of gym and conditioning programmes is getting far better, I still think in the Championship, the access to the gym is quite limited for the players. Reliance on a once a week gym programme is not sufficient.\"',\n",

Hamstring injuries were the most common at 11%.',\n",

       "  'Arsenal Women play their final WSL game of 2022, as they travel to the Midlands to face 5th placed Aston Villa at Villa Park. Here are three things to watch for. ',\n",
       "  'Rachel Daly was Aston Villa’s big summer signing, and one who has put Villa at the top of the rest of the WSL. Broadly speaking, the midtable of the WSL have teams that are well-organized and have a good defensive shape. The big difference between Aston Villa, Tottenham, and Everton is that Aston Villa have a striker who scores goals. Rachel Daly was often prolific in the NWSL, with Houston, and she’s the joint top scorer in the WSL this season, with 8 goals, albeit with 3 from the penalty spot. Still, 5 non-penalty goals puts her level with Sam Kerr (and Frida Maanum). Daly can drop deep to knit play, but she feasts on crosses, with service coming from Alisha Lehmann and Kirsty Hanson. Kenza Dalí joined in the summer and has added creativity to Villa’s midfield. Villa are third in the WSL in crosses into the penalty area per game, with Hanson, Lehmann and right back Sarah Mayling playing the most per game. Mayling is also Villa’s top progresser from the back. ',\n",
       "  'Arsenal have had a tactical rejig in recent weeks. With Beth Mead out and Lina Hurtig out, and Mana Iwabuchi not favoured, Katie McCabe has been the right winger almost by default, as soon as she wasn’t required at left back. McCabe plays as an inverted winger on the right hand side, which is contrary to how Beth Mead plays on the right. McCabe will act almost as a third central midfielder or #10, which allows Vivianne Miedema to push higher up. As a result, there’s space on the right hand side. On Wednesday, Stina Blackstenius exploited that space to set up Miedema’s winner against Juventus, with Blackstenius’ cross set up by a dink from Leah Williamson. Williamson is unlikely to start, having started midweek, but Rafaelle Souza should return. Rafaelle has the ability to play diagonals, but also plays longer passes down the wing or into the channel. ',\n",
       "  'Stina Blackstenius assisted Vivianne Miedema’s winner against Juventus, but she hasn’t scored in over a month for Arsenal, last netting against Leicester City. In this four match scoreless run, Blackstenius has had chances, but just hasn’t been able to convert, with an xG from the four games of 1.6. Shots haven’t been lacking; she’s taken 13, and has been somewhat unlucky, having hit the woodwork, but Arsenal will need her to find her scoring boots again. Essentially, the underlying numbers are fine, but with two crucial games after Villa, against Lyon and Zurich in the Champions League, a goal for Blackstenius would be very valuable heading into the final stretch of matches in the year. ',\n",
       "  'Player to watch: Laura Wienroither',\n",
       "  'Laura Wienroither has wrestled the starting right back role from Noëlle Maritz, and has done nothing to cede the role. There’s a new challenge for Wienroither now, though; with McCabe ahead of her, there’s more space for Wienroither, but also more passing and creative responsibility. One thing Wienroither is very good at doing is being a direct player, including getting into the attacking and final third. With Arsenal’s switches of play, that could be a route to goal, with build-up play down the left.',\n",

It’s crazy and it’s reflected in their spotty transfer record over the past five years or so. Most other clubs either have or are developing these areas, specifically in analytics. While Spurs are bolstering their recruitment with the additions of Paratici and Steinsson, it’s not clear what they’re using (beyond existing contacts) to identify targets. Spurs could do a lot of good for themselves if they would flesh out and develop the parts of the club that few fans rarely see so there’s at least a coherent back office that can guide the overall direction of the club.',\n",

Spurs used to be the scrappy underdog that punched above its weight, but while it’s now in an entirely new weight class, the big dogs have only gotten bigger in the ensuing years. Spurs need to figure out its identity. Are they the Dortmund of the Premier League — buying undervalued young talents, developing them, and selling them for big money to reinvest? Or are they going to start throwing their financial weight around in order to slug it out with the Citys, Chelseas, Uniteds, and (now) Newcastles?

Now with Conte’s Spurs team half-formed and results not coming, Spurs are in this weird nether-region where they aren’t sure whether to back Conte fully, especially if Conte isn’t planning on sticking around long term.

One option is to create a Chelsea-style loan army and flip them for a small profit, but Spurs don’t seem to want to do that either, as there’s a prevailing guiding principle that Tottenham should be generating their own talent. Something has to change because Spurs are losing youth players to other clubs. Spurs needs to figure out what they want out of the academy — money, or future first teamers — and stick to it.',\n",

There’s a strong rumor that Spurs are going to break the WSL intra-league transfer record with a bid for Chelsea Women’s Beth England. That’s fantastic news, but hopefully only the start. ',\n",

A club like Spurs with their new stadium needs to be playing at the highest level or find themselves slipping back behind the usual suspects.',\n",

       "  'Yves Bissouma (Community — 2.0): Whoof. Another disappointing performance in Spurs’ midfield. Surely a part of that was Spurs being outnumbered in that area of the pitch, but he just doesn’t seem to work in tandem with Hojbjerg. Got torched and then made a dumb tactical foul, picking up his fifth yellow so he’s suspended tomorrow.',\n",

       "  'Harry Kane (Community — 2.0): Hey did you guise know that Harry Kane didn’t touch the ball for the first 19 minutes of the first half? As annoying as the ongoing match commentary was, they were right — Kane was a non-factor apart from the header that was saved by Villa’s keeper. With Kane, you need him to either take shots, or generate chances for others. Sure, his service was garbage, but he didn’t do either on Sunday.',\n",

       "  'Time Out’s Londoner of the Year on QPR, sports bras and the aftermath of that historic day at Wembley',\n",
       "  'It’s a crisp, sunny Monday lunchtime in late October and a spontaneous round of applause has erupted from the astroturf pitches above Hoxton’s Britannia Leisure Centre.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'For the past hour or so, a low hum of excitable chatter has been punctuated only by the periodic thwack of footballs against walls. Forty-odd amateur players, from a host of local women’s teams, stand around doing keep-ups and taking turns to fire off shots at a goalkeeper on the far end of the pitch. But now Lioness Chloe Kelly is here, giving a meek wave as she steps onto the turf, and everyone is cheering like it’s July 31 all over again.\\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       "  'Five months earlier, the reaction of even the most ardent of women’s football fans to the arrival of the England forward might have been a little more muted. But that was before 23 million Brits tuned in to watch her punt the ball over the line in the 110th minute of extra time at this summer’s Women’s Euros Final, securing the Lionesses’ first ever major trophy in front of a record-breaking Wembley crowd.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'That was before her instantly iconic celebration – pausing just long enough to check that the goal would stand before whipping off her shirt and helicoptering it overhead, sports bra on full display – or an equally memorable post-match interview where she ran off with the microphone mid-sentence to join her teammates in an ecstatic rendition of ‘Sweet Caroline’.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'In short, that was before the 24-year-old from Ealing became a household name literally overnight.',\n",
       "  'Coming out of her cage',\n",
       "  'Cage football is a big deal in London. The enclosed concrete pitches are the beating hearts of the city’s housing estates, places where kids congregate at all hours of the day and night to show off their skills in small-sided games, whooping and yelling every time someone pulls off an improbable dribble or an audacious nutmeg. Cage football is where most of the impressively large cohort of current London-born Premier League players cut their teeth, not to mention England legends like Alex Scott and Rio Ferdinand.\\xa0',\n",
       "  \"And it’s the cage – one specific cage, on Southall’s Windmill Park Estate – where Chloe Kelly’s journey to European Champion began, with countless hours spent playing street football with her five older brothers. ‘I think my game is the way it is today, because of learning my trade that way rather than being coached,’ she explains. ‘When you play cage football there's not many rules, it's just go and be free and enjoy yourself and because there's so many people on that pitch you have to use your skill to get out of certain situations, but it's very physical at the same time, you're getting bounced off the cage fence,’ she says, miming being slammed off the wall.\\xa0\",\n",
       "  '‘Now, when I look at my career, I think I wouldn’t have been the player I am without those moments in the cages with my brothers being tough on me. I go there sometimes when I come home to see kids playing and it brings back so many memories, just walking past.’\\xa0',\n",
       "  'West London to the world\\xa0',\n",
       "  'She might play her football in Manchester these days, but Chloe Kelly is west London through and through. Raised as an avid supporter of local Championship side Queen’s Park Rangers, it was the west London club’s crest that she was draped in when the BBC’s Rachel Brown-Finnis finally managed to drag her back for the second part of that post-victory interview, and the club’s home ground, Loftus Road, where she received a hero’s welcome on the opening day of the Premier League season, a week after scoring the goal that she described as her ‘Bobby Zamora moment’.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'But it’s also at her childhood club’s academy that she took her first steps towards a professional career. ‘My first game was at Loftus Road, so that was really special for me and my family,’ she remembers. ‘But I knew I had to take a step forward in my career and challenge myself more so I moved to Middlesex under 12s for one season and then I moved to Arsenal’.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'Breaking into the senior squad of English football’s most successful women’s team was quite the challenge. ‘There were so many great players in that team, the likes of Kelly Smith and Rachel Yankee. Kelly was my idol growing up so to share the pitch of her was incredible and I was learning so much. But it got to a point in my career where I had to be playing football and sitting on the bench was frustrating. So that’s when I made the move up north.’',\n",
       "  '‘I was so, so homesick,’ Chloe says of her move to Everton, ‘but I knew that was what I needed to do to get where I am today.’ And while she’s now swapped Merseyside for Man City, she’s still a Londoner at heart.\\xa0 ‘I always remember where I come from. London’s my roots. Even though I’ve been up north for so long, it’s always home.’',\n",
       "  'After all, not many people can say that a London bus route has been named after them, a rare privilege that was bestowed on Chloe back in September when the number 92 from Ealing to Brent was christened in her honour. ‘I used to get the 92 from my house to Wembley to go and watch games,’ she recalls. ‘When I think about young girls like me seeing my name on the bus…it’s amazing.’\\xa0',\n",
       "  'Changing the game',\n",
       "  'It’s not always easy, being a newly minted national treasure. By the time we sit down for our chat – sequestered in a tiny staff room somewhere in the bowels of the Leisure Centre – Chloe must have signed at least three dozen autographs and posed for as many selfies over the course of a hectic day that saw her rise bright and early the morning after a league victory against Liverpool to make it today’s shoot. Another impromptu meet and greet with a handful of the venue’s enraptured staff will follow before the country’s new Patron Saint of Sports Bras is bundled into a taxi back up north.\\xa0',\n",
       "  \"You get the sense that sort of thing happens just about everywhere she goes now. Take a recent night out with her England teammates in Manchester. ‘I’m on the way to meet the girls for team bonding and this car of women starts screaming out the window at me,’ she says. ‘So I'm dancing and waving at them, and then I look and I'm like “Wait, that wasn't my teammates.” I was really embarrassed, like, “How the hell do they know who I am?” And I think that's when I realised that things have changed so much.’\",\n",
       "  'And changed they most certainly have; the Lionesses’ victory has already inspired a dramatic uptick in interest in women’s football. Attendance figures for the Women’s Super League are up 50 percent on last season, and a new record was set in September when 47,000 fans watched the North London Derby at the Emirates. At-home audience figures are similarly encouraging, with Sky reporting that average audiences for WSL games have doubled in the same time.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'It’s overwhelmingly positive news for the future of the women’s game, but this is just the beginning. ‘Throughout the tournament Jill Scott kept saying “Something’s happening, something’s happening!” And it did, it was a special summer,’ Chloe says. ‘But now it’s about keeping our foot on the gas. It’s a great opportunity for everyone involved in women’s sport to push forward, but as soon as we take our foot off the gas it’s easy for everyone else to switch off.’\\xa0',\n",
       "  'For Chloe, that means ensuring that the next generation of potential Euros winners\\xa0is nurtured properly. It’s clearly a subject that the European champions are passionate about, with the squad having written a letter to the incumbent Prime Minister in the aftermath of their victory, calling on the government to support in ensuring that ‘every young girl in the nation’ is allowed to play football at school. ‘If we allow them the opportunity to play and give them the best possible chance, then there are many moments like the Euros that they can experience too,’ Chloe says. ‘But they need the opportunity to play first.’',\n",
       "  '2023 and beyond\\xa0',\n",
       "  'The future certainly looks bright for women’s football in this country, but so does the present. Having breezed through their final round of qualifiers in the autumn, the Lionesses will travel to Australia next summer to compete in the 2023 Women’s World Cup.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'It’s an even bigger challenge for the European champions, but one that they’re excited to face, especially after coming out on top against a dominant USA team who currently hold the title. ‘It’s great to see where we’re at as a group against top opposition,’ Chloe says of that recent sold out friendly at Wembley. ‘I’m really driven and I want to achieve great things. The feeling of one medal around your neck is amazing but it just makes you want more success.’',\n",
       "  'For now, that historic first medal is tucked safely away in her underwear drawer at home. And as for the sports bra? ‘I’m getting it framed.’',\n",

       "  'Goals from Fran Kirby and Jelena Čanković (x2) outdid a Royals fightback through Sanne Troelsgaard and Amalie Eikeland.',\n",
       "  'The Reading players will be, quite rightly, aggrieved by the officiating after a fantastic second-half comeback saw them leave Kings Meadow empty-handed and on the wrong end of a 3-2 score line on Sunday night.',\n",
       "  'Kelly Chambers had already voiced her concerns over the standard of refereeing in the WSL this season and this match will only endorse and enforce her opinion after conceding an opening goal from a quickly taken Chelsea free-kick that should have been flagged for offside.',\n",
       "  'Deanna Cooper was adjudged to have given away a foul on the far corner of the Reading penalty area. As Cooper hobbled away, Chelsea quickly took the free kick; the pass to Johanna Rytting Kaneryd - although offside - was squared to Fran Kirby to put the Blues into an early lead after 15 minutes.',\n",
       "  'The Reading bench, with access to the replays, were visibly disappointed and felt let down again by the officials. Phil Cousins, the Royals’ head coach, picked up a yellow card on 20 minutes when his frustration understandably boiled over.',\n",
       "  'It was a shame and real blow for the Royals who started the first quarter of the match well and were equal to the league leaders. Emma Harries kept the captain’s armband throughout the night and put in a super performance. She forced the first Royals corner of the match, on 11 minutes, taking on Magdalena Eriksson down the left wing.',\n",
       "  'From the resultant corner the ball was cleared to Tia Primmer who, after scoring from outside the penalty area against Liverpool, was confident enough to take on another ambitious effort – this time the teenager seeing her attempted lob just too high of the Chelsea crossbar.',\n",
       "  'There were a couple of early scares for the Royals too. Jacqueline Burns was called into action in the first four minutes, her punched clearance fired back in by Chelsea and blocked on the near post by some great recovery defending by Gemma Evans.',\n",
       "  'Reading enjoyed some good attacking down the right-hand side of the pitch. On 24 minutes Sanne Troelsgaard passed to Emma Harries whose right-foot cross was aimed for Lauren Wade at the near post, but was cleared by England international Millie Bright to safety.',\n",
       "  'After some promising play, Reading found themselves 2-0 down just before the half-hour mark. Tia Primmer lost the ball just outside the Reading penalty area, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd’s shot hitting the upright and rebounding back across the penalty area for Jelana Cankovic to react the quickest and side foot into the Reading goal from close range.',\n",
       "  'Within minutes the Royals looked like they may be in trouble when Jelana Cankovic scored her second goal of the evening, nodding home a cross from Erin Cuthbert from the right and put the home side into a commanding 3-0 lead.',\n",
       "  'Apart from a long-range left-foot strike by Justine Vanhaevermaet, after another run and cross from the right by Emma Harries, it was the home side on the ascendancy. The score line remained 3-0 at half-time after some heroic defending and blocks by Gemma Evans and Faye Bryson, and some brave goalkeeping by Jacqueline Burns who needed treatment after a dive and clash with her own team mate.',\n",
       "  'Team: Burns, Bryson, Cooper, Evans, Woodham, Vanhaevermaet, Primmer, Eikeland, Troelsgaard, Wade, Harries',\n",
       "  'After the victory last week against Tottenham Hotspur, Kelly Chambers rewarded the players with an unchanged starting 11 and kept faith with the same team for the start of the second half.',\n",
       "  'Within minutes of the restart Deanna Cooper picked up the Royals’ first playing staff yellow card after sticking out a right leg to stop the Chelsea striker running into the penalty area. Cooper was almost immediately back in the action, this time using her head to deflect a shot from Erin Cuthbert.',\n",
       "  'It was an injury that saw Kelly Chambers make her first substitution of the evening with Rachel Rowe replacing Tia Primmer who hobbled off the pitch.',\n",
       "  'On the hour mark Reading got a lifeline after a cross from Emma Harries, on the right, was cleared by Euros champion Mille Bright, only as far as Sanne Troelsgaard. The Danish international still had a lot to do but managed to side step and get an early shot on goal, past the Chelsea goal keeper, Ann-Katrin Berger, who will have been disappointed to see that go under her body. 3-1.',\n",
       "  'Within 60 seconds it was jubilation as the Royals scored again with a great move and finish down the right-hand side of the pitch. Sanne Troelsgaard’s pass found Rachel Rowe who, in turn, quickly found Emma Harries with her cross perfectly pulled back to Amalie Eikeland who scored Reading’s second goal of the night. 3-2, game on!',\n",
       "  'Faye Bryson picked up a yellow card shortly before being replaced by Reading’s club captain Emma Mukandi - Kelly Chambers presumably looking for experience to try and salvage something out of the match. The third change saw Lauren Wade swapped for Charlie Wellings as the Royals pushed for an equaliser and one that would have been well deserved.',\n",
       "  'Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, can’t have imagined she would have found her team in this position with 15 minutes to go and had to resort to bringing on three substitutes including the formidable Sam Kerr and Guro Reiten.',\n",
       "  'Although there were five minutes of time added on, Chelsea managed to see out the match and, to their relief, finish as 3-2 winners.',\n",
       "  'It was another entertaining game another great comeback attempt by the Royals but, all too similarly, the effort was unrewarded. I’m sure though that Kelly Chambers will have more to say about that.',\n",
       "  'Chelsea, although pleased by the money from Sky, will surely be disappointed by the crowd of only 1,184 (if I heard correctly). Perhaps not a surprise with a kick-off of 6.45pm on a school night, just before Christmas, with sub-zero temperatures and a pitch that resembled a Dickensian Christmas Carol scene (with the assistant referee playing the part of Scrooge…)',\n",

       "  'Jurgen Klopp: “It was a wild game and a game Brentford won so I’m not really sure you can control it all the time,” he tells Sky Sports. “Each corner was a massive threat. We knew before the game they’d be difficult to deal with and obviously they ‘stretch’ the rules in these moments. There’s full body contact and theres only one defensive foul off a set-piece tonight which was whistled against us, which is really funny. ',\n",
       "  '“Apart from that we conceded the first goal in a moment when we should already have been 2-0 up, with misses from Darwin and Kostas pretty much alone in front of the goal. Darwin doesn’t expect Mee to block there and Kostas should have been better with his shooting technique. But we get away with a goal from an offside position and then they score immediately and we are not there, so that’s a massive point for criticism.” ',\n",
       "  'Thomas Frank: “I can’t say that they’re surprising me massively but they keep impressing me,” says Thomas Frank of his players in an interview with Sky Sports. “It’s a fantastic result for us in many, many ways but to do what we were capable of doing here against Liverpool is very impressive.”',\n",
       "  'Was he concerned about how his players would peform in the absence of Ivan Toney? ““It would be silly to say no,” he says. “Ivan is such a key player for us and has been fantastic in many ways.',\n",
       "  '“If you ask me if I want to play him I’ll say ‘Yes, of course’. But we need more than 11 players and I’m so pleased that Wissa came in and scored. I think he’s our second top scorer in the Premier League over the last two seasons. He played fantastic.”',\n",
       "  'Premier League: “This was a thudding reality check for anyone who thought Liverpool, having dusted themselves down over the winter break, would stroll back into the top four.” Nick Ames reports from the Gtech Community Stadium.',\n",
       "  'A quick recap: Brentford went ahead courtesy of an Ibrahima Konate own goal in the first half and then had two Yoane Wissa goals disallowed for offside before the DR Congo international finally got his name on the scoresheet with a fine header. ',\n",
       "  'Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp made three changes at half-time and his side roared out of the traps after the break. Darwin Nunez scored with a fine strike only to have his effort ruled out for offside, before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain got on the end of a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross to nod home and pull a goal back for Liverpool. They huffed and puffed but couldn’t force an equaliser before Brentford put the game beyond them courtesy of a Bryan Mbeumo strike on 84 minutes. ',\n",
       "  'An email: “Mbeumo beating Alisson may be the first time since Aboubakar headed past Ederson in the World Cup that a Cameroon international beat a Brazil international keeper to seal a surprise win,” writes Peter Oh. ',\n",
       "  'The Bees are buzzing: There’s a full on impromptu rave taking place on the pitch and in the stands, as the Brentford players and their sports start busting out moves to Gala’s Freed From Desire, which is belting out over the PA.',\n",
       "  'No doubt the Fun Police will have something to say about such scenes of unbridled jubilation but that was hard fought win by Bus Stop in Hounslow FC and all involved have every right to enjoy it.',\n",
       "  'How things stand: This win sends Brentford into seventh place in the table, just two points behind Liverpool, who stay in sixth after losing their fifth league game of the season. Their players and staff are milking the applause of the delighted home fans and it is well deserved. They were brilliant tonight. ',\n",
       "  'Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeeep! It’s all over at the Gtech Community Stadium, where Brentford have run out extremely worthy winners against Liverpool. They were outstanding tonight against a Liverpool side who were little short of shambolic in the first half, but got their game faces on for the second. ',\n",
       "  '90+6 min: Bryan Mbeumo is announced as man of the match and receives a warm embrace from Ivan Toney, who is sitting just behind the Brentford dug-out. In truth, any number of Brentford players would have been worthy winners of the gong. ',\n",
       "  '90+5 min: Ben Mee hacks a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross into the Brentford penalty area upfield despite hearing a shout from David Raya. ',\n",
       "  '90+4 min: Josh Dasilva plays the ball along the deck through the middle for Keane Lewis-Potter. Brentford get the ball into Liverpool’s penalty area again with Rico Henry delivering the cross but the ball ends up in the hands of Alisson. ',\n",
       "  '90+1 min: Sergio Canos is on for Bryan Mbeumo and tries to latch on to a ball in behind from Keane Lewis-Potter. Andy Robertson stands firm, defends stoutly and shepherds the ball back to Alisson. That’s how you do it, Ibrahima. ',\n",
       "  '89 min: That was Brentford’s first shot on goal of note in this second half and they dispatched it with aplomb and have presumably put the game beyond Liverpool. It’s been a superb performance from the Bees, both on the front and back foot. We’ll haver six added minutes. ',\n",
       "  '86 min: Jurgen Klopp, Ibrahima Konate and the rest of Liverpool’s players are furious that Mbeumo’s goal wasn’t disallowed for what they saw as a foul on Konate in the build-up. Replays show their anger is misplaced and they are nothing short of delusional. There was no foul; Konate just wasn’t strong enough to hold off Mbeumo as they tussled for a 50-50 ball and simply fell over, leaving the Brentford striker with a clear path to goal.',\n",
       "  'Brentford stretch their lead! Ibrahima Konate fails to deal with a long diagonal ball towards Mbeumo from Norgaard and goes to ground as the duo tussle for it. Mbeumo finds himself through on goal and slots the ball past Alisson.',\n",
       "  '83 min: Liverpool substitution: Curtis Jones on for goalscorer Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Jones has previous when it comes to scoring at the Gtech Community Stadium, having scored a beauty in the corresponding fixture last year. ',\n",
       "  '82 min: Into the final 10 minutes go with Brentford hanging on reasonably comfortably having weathered a Liverpool storm of sorts. ',\n",
       "  '80 min: Liverpool win two corners in quick succession. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s delivery is met by Ibrahima Konate, whose downward header bounces in the six-yard box and goes wide of the far post. ',\n",
       "  '78 min: Alisson sprints out of his area to sweep up a Janelt pass from deep under pressure from Mbeumo. There’s no time for any fancy stuff and he larrups the ball high up the pitch as hard as he can. ',\n",
       "  '77 min: Josh Dasilva loses the ball, misplacing a pass and gifting possession to Fabinho halfway inside the Liverpool half. He sends Nunez in behind the Brentford defence with a quick, low through ball from deep but the Uruguayan is miles offside. ',\n",
       "  '75 min: Mo Salah crosses low into the Brentford penalty area and Naby Keita’s touch tees up Trent Alexander-Arnold. Instead of shooting first time with the left foot we know he can use, he tries to shift the ball on to his favoured right. Brentford clear. ',\n",
       "  '73 min: Darwin Nunez is booked for something or other, moments before Brentford make a double-substitution: Josh Dasilva and Keane Lewis-Potter come on for Matthias Jensen and Yoane Wissa, who have both played very well. ',\n",
       "  '72 min: Liverpool win a corner. Andy Robertson’s delivery is headed clear by Ethan Pinnock. ',\n",
       "  '71 min: With three Brentford players queuing up at the far post to meet a cross from the right, Trent Alexander-Arnold does very well to win the ball and clear. ',\n",
       "  '69 min: Darwin Nunez pulls a low diagonal shot well wide of the far post after a poor touch by Norgaard gifted possession to Mo Salah and allowed him to play the Uruguayan in behind. ',\n",
       "  '68 min: Brentford are sitting dangerously deep, inviting Liverpool on to them. It might be time for a Thomas Frank reshuffle and there appears to be activity on the subs bench behind him. ',\n",
       "  '66 min: Salah and Keita combine on the edge of the Brentford penalty area and win their side a corner. Robertson’s inswinger is cleared at the near post by Norgaard, who hoofs the ball upfield unceremoniously. ',\n",
       "  '64 min: Brentford remain in the lead but on the back foot with about half an hour to play. Liverpool are not looking quite as dangerous following their very intense start to the second half but the outcome of this game remains very much in the balance. ',\n",
       "  '61 min: Naby Keita is penalised for a foul on Christian Norgaard, who is in no great rush to get back to his feet. ',\n",
       "  '60 min: Thiago has a low drive from distance blocked. The ball breaks his way and his next shot is deflected out for a corner. Nothing comes of it although it takes Brentford an eternity to clear the ball. ',\n",
       "  '58 min: Another ball into the box from Trent Alexander-Arnold sails too close to David Raya, who clutches it to his chest and drops to the ground. ',\n",
       "  '57 min: Thiago gets booked for a cynical foul on Yoane Wissa. ',\n",
       "  '55 min: There has been a significant improvement in Liverpool’s performance in this second half, due in no small part to the changes in personnel and the monumental bollocking they almost certainly got from their manager at half-time. ',\n",
       "  '54 min: Brentford win another throw-in deep in Liverpool territory. With everyone expecting another long effort from Matthias Jensen, he plays it short and his side win a corner. The ball’s played to the far post, where Ben Mee heads it back across the face of goal. Liverpool clear their lines. ',\n",
       "  '52 min: Trent Alexander-Arnold slings another cross into the Brentford penalty area, this time with his right foot. His delivery is too close to David Raya, who gathers with a minimum of fuss. ',\n",
       "  'Liverpool pull one back … again. Trent Alexander-Arnold moves the ball on to his left foot and whips the ball across the Brentford penalty area. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is on hand to steer the ball home with a header from seven yards. There was nothing wrong with that one.',\n",
       "  'Brentford 2-0 Liverpool: VAR shows that Nunez was a mite offside as he ran on to that pass from Thiago and his splendid finish is chalked off. It’s still 2-0 and Brentford’s fans roar their approval. ',\n",
       "  'Liverpool pull a goal back! It’s a splendid finish from Darwin Nunez, who runs in behind the Brentford defence on to a Thiago pass from deep, but was he offside?',\n",
       "  '46 min: Play resumes with the left side of the Liverpool defence replaced. The visitors immediately win a corner but nothing comes of it. ',\n",
       "  'Liverpool make three changes: Andrew Robertson, Joel Matip and Naby Keita are on for the second half. Virgil van Dijk, Kostas Tsimikas and Harvey Elliott are off. Big Virgil gets hooked at half-time? Oof. There’s a possibility he’s injured, of course … but he was truly dreadful in that first half. ',\n",
       "  '“Brentford isn’t just beating Liverpool, they are bossing them all over the pitch,” writes Mary Waltz. “While my Everton squad is in a relegation battle we just might lose, seeing the Reds getting slapped around is satisfying in an admittedly petty fashion.” ',\n",
       "  '“Liverpool were beyond lucky against Leicester with the spectacular Faes brace of own goals bringing them a scarcely deserved win,” writes Colum Fordham. “But Konate’s deflection shows own goals can come back to bite.”',\n",
       "  'Peep! A mess at the back and offering very little up front short of one very presentable chance missed by Darwin Nunez, Liverpool trudge off for their half-time brew losing by two goals.',\n",
       "  'An unwitting Ibrahima Konate opened the scoring for Brentford, allowing the ball to ricochet off his shin and past his own goalkeeper at a corner. Brentford’s Yoane Wissa had two further “goals” correctly ruled out for offside but was nothing if not persistent. Rather than let his head drop, he used it to steer the ball past Alisson to get a well deserved goal at the third time of asking.',\n",
       "  '45+1 min: It was Matthias Jensen who turned provider for Brentford’s second goal. His cross to the far post was inch perfect for Wissa, who outjumped at least one defender to head home. Jurgen Klopp looks completely shell-shocked in his technical area. ',\n",
       "  '44 min: Trailing 2-0 and extremely lucky to be only trailing by so few goals, Liverpool are an absolute shambles at the back. Their defence is all over the place and concede a second goal only 13 seconds after being granted a very fortunate reprieve. ',\n",
       "  'Brentford double their lead again and this one stands!!! Wissas finally gets one in his credit column at the third time of asking, heading home a cross from the right at the far post. It was a fine downward header that Alisson appeared to miraculously claw clear but technology informs the ref that the ball had crossed the line.',\n",
       "  'How’s your luck, Yoane Wissa? The Brentford striker has another goal disallowed for an offside but on this occasion he wasn’t the culprit. But hang on!',\n",
       "  'Brentford double their lead! It’s dreadful from Liverpool who concede from a corner again. Yoane Wissa fires home but it might be disallowed because his effort hit Ibrahima Konate and then Ben Mee, who was standing in an offside position, as it travelled into the goal.',\n",
       "  '38 min: Rico Henry steals the ball from Trent Alexander-Arnold, who had been sold short by a dreadful pass from Tsimikas. Henry crosses the ball to the far post, where the Greek atones for his error by putting it out for a corner. ',\n",
       "  '37 min: A poor clearance from Alisson almost results in an opportunity for Wissa. The flag goes up as he was coming back from an offside position as he tried to win the ball.',\n",
       "  '35 min: Salah controls a pass from Fabinho and hooks a cross from the inside- right into the Brentford penalty area, trying to pick out Darwin Nunez on the edge of the six-yard box. Brentford clear comfortably. '],\n",

       "  'The English top flight has written to the game’s international rule-making body, the International Football Association Board, asking to trial temporary substitutes from next summer. To date only permanent concussion substitutes have been tested in men’s football, despite vocal criticism from brain injury charities.',\n",
       "  'The Premier League returns to competition on Boxing Day after a six-week break imposed by the winter World Cup.

       "  'One of the few top-flight competitions to have trialled concussion substitutes at all, the Premier League believes that permanent subs have had a positive impact, allowing medics greater time to make accurate assessments of head injuries. English football authorities have also defended permanent substitutes from criticism in the past, although the players’ union the PFA has always argued for temporary changes.',\n",
       "  'But after consulting club doctors during the World Cup break an overwhelming consensus for using temporary substitutes has emerged. Doctors argue temporary subs would take pressure off decision-making by allowing tests to be conducted away from the field. If a player was ultimately found to have sustained concussion, the temporary substitute would then become permanent.',\n",
       "  'The Premier League expects a response to a joint request, made alongside MLS in the USA and France’s Ligue 1, in the spring of 2023. It believes it will face opposition to any change both from other European leagues and Fifa.',\n",
       "  'The brain injury association Headway welcomed the news. The charity has been a vocal supporter of temporary substitutes and criticised football’s slow adoption of tougher concussion protocols. On Wednesday its chief executive, Luke Griggs, said the change would be a “progressive development” in protecting players from brain injury.',\n",
       "  '“Headway has repeatedly called for football to bring in temporary substitutes and, if this is confirmed, it will be warmly welcomed,” Griggs said. “The evolving nature of concussion means that a 10-minute off-pitch assessment will never be foolproof. But it will allow for medics more time to make better informed decisions, in the quiet confines of the dressing room, rather than snap judgments made on the pitch.”',\n",

It will urge match officials both to crack down on and add time for moments lost. But officials have decided they will not go as far as Fifa did in Qatar, for example adding on time for goal celebrations, despite their own statistics showing the ball was in play almost three minutes longer during World Cup group stage matches than it has been in the Premier League season to date (58 minutes to 55 minutes and 18 seconds).

Noble played more than 500 games for West Ham, from 2004 to May this year, and the consistency and loyalty of that commitment stand in sharp contrast with the outlandish riches which will transform the Premier League much further.',\n",
       "  '“People love football, globally,” Noble says as he prepares to begin his challenging position in January. “Other sports are fantastic but they don’t [generate] that affection, yes obsession, we have with football. I’m talking about countries that people don’t even know exist which love football.”',\n",
       "  'The 35-year-old might not sound worldly in that last sentence but the way in which Manchester City and Newcastle United have already been taken over by consortiums led by members of the royal families in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia has set a clear precedent. Manchester United and Liverpool may be sold next year and different nations could enter the bidding.',\n",
       "  'David Sullivan and David Gold, West Ham’s owners since January 2010, enjoy their reputation as local wheelers-and-dealers, but how does the prospect of half the Premier League being owned by countries make Noble feel? “Well, it depends,” he says, as he starts to laugh. “It depends if we are [owned by a nation]. The great thing about the Premier League is, because there is a lot of financial power, the games ain’t as easy as they would be in other leagues. But if you want the best players it’s different.',\n",
       "  '“I saw an interview with Erling Haaland’s agent [Rafaela Pimenta] the other day and she was saying: ‘Well, why ain’t Haaland worth a billion because of his image rights, contracts and everything else that goes with him? You laugh but then you think about it and, when you actually break it down, future global superstars probably will be worth [a billion pounds].”',\n",
       "  'How will Noble react when part of his remit as sporting director will be to help West Ham cope with the astronomical wealth accumulated by rivals such as Manchester City? “You’ve got the top six, maybe even seven in the Premier League. You’ve got two or three in the German league and the same in the Spanish league. In the French league, obviously you’ve got PSG [owned by Qatar] and one or two others. So we’re not in that market because the Champions League is a massive draw for players.',\n",
       "  '“We need to be in the market of probably 25 teams across Europe. Maybe from fourth to eighth in the Spanish league, the same in the German league. Those are our rivals when we are recruiting players because we can’t afford to buy who we want. It’s not going to happen. So we’ve got to be clever and find ways of recruiting young players and developing them, bringing them from the academy to the first team because that’s a massive plus. We’ve seen that with Declan Rice [who succeeded Noble as club captain], Ben Johnson [the West Ham defender], myself and others. A good young English player is worth 40 million quid. It’s incredible. So if we can produce three or four of them, we’re doing something right.”',\n",
       "  'It is debatable whether West Ham can hold on to Rice much longer – especially when, at the World Cup, the England midfielder said how much he wants to play Champions League football and that “you only get one career”. Noble sounds pragmatic when discussing a player he has mentored for years and as the Premier League resumes on Boxing Day with West Ham, two places above the relegation zone, away to the leaders Arsenal.',\n",
       "  '“Whether you think things will get dicey at West Ham – and I don’t believe they will – we just can’t cope financially with the top teams. We can try our hardest to recruit the best players that the top five or six don’t buy – and we might get lucky with a few that slip through the net – but you can’t compete with these teams. They’re financially too powerful. If a top club wants Declan Rice they’re just going to pay for him, full stop. You’ve seen it with Jack Grealish, with the best players. If the top boys want them, we ain’t got a chance.”',\n",
       "  'There is more romance in Noble’s personal story as Mr West Ham and, as his new book captures, he thrived as a one-club player whose career is unlikely to be emulated in such a volatile and money-driven future for Premier League football. There are parallels with Steven Gerrard at Liverpool but Noble lived so close to West Ham, whose academy he joined at 13, that he could walk home after he made his first-team debut at Upton Park four years later. He was with his girlfriend, Carly, who is now his wife.',\n",
       "  '“I wasn’t prepared for two middle-aged men to spot me in the street,” Noble recalls in his book. “‘Well done, Marky boy,’ one shouted. ‘Oh my God, Mark,’ Carly said as we walked on. ‘He knew who you were.’”',\n",
       "  'That affection for Noble, who had been waiting outside the Boleyn ground to ask West Ham players for their autographs six months earlier, grew into a profound love affair between the supporters and their eventual captain. It helped that he grew up in nearby Beckton but Noble also showed a dedication to help West Ham in any way he could. However, he reveals how that close bond came at a cost. Noble put football above everything else and the strain often felt consuming.',\n",
       "  'He and Carly “got chicken and chips” on their walk home after his debut but it did not take long for him to change. He became single-minded and prioritised football – at the expense of Carly, his family and friends. “I’m open about that,” he says. “There were times that everything got on top of me. You’ve got to be the Premier League footballer and West Ham academy graduate – but also a best mate, a husband, father, a son, a brother. We had our two kids really young and I thought: ‘I’ve got no choice now. I have to become successful. I have to be able to provide for Carly and the kids.’ But I became incredibly selfish.”',\n",

       "  'The demands were draining and Noble admits there were times where “I had broken relationships with other family members”. It became difficult for him to enjoy even the good times. “You almost become immune to the good times. They just bring relief because points are so sacred in the Premier League that if you win it’s relief more than joy. Joy is when you’re 17 and you break into the first team and everyone thinks you’re a hero. But I became a senior pro at 21 and you’re expected to win, you’re expected to play well.”',\n",

I agree with the new system but, in a lot of ways I don’t, because football is a ruthless industry where it feels like there is no place for weakness. Everyone’s job’s on the line and if you go into training with a grade two hamstring tear, you know you can’t train. But if you go in and say: ‘I’m not mentally stable or in the right frame of mind to train today,’ people would say: ‘What are you fucking on about?’',\n",

Forget the nice cars, the big houses and the nice watches. That’s 2% of what it means to be a footballer.’”',\n",
       "  'Noble will be heavily involved in recruitment, development of the academy and the wellbeing of players. “I love the game but I also love the business side of football,” Noble says. “My relationship with [West Ham’s manager] David Moyes over the past two and a half years is probably one of the reasons that West Ham asked me to do this job.”',\n",
       "  'Yet West Ham’s fans seem disillusioned with the season so far. “Probably a group of fans, yes. But there’s always going to be that at every club now. You hear people saying the fans are not happy with [Jürgen] Klopp at Liverpool. That’s the industry we work in now and, because of social media, it has become a lot louder.”',\n",
       "  'Describing this season as “a transition” for West Ham, Noble is at his most animated when talking about Lionel Messi. “What it must be like to be Messi,” he says with wonder as his words mingle with laughter. “He’s on another planet. I watched his documentary [before the World Cup] and you look at the experience he had losing three [Copa América] finals in a row and losing the World Cup final and then always being compared to [Diego] Maradona. He was fucking distraught and he is the greatest that’s ever walked the earth.',\n",
       "  '“I remember when Chelsea played against him and JT [John Terry] came flying across and he was on the touchline ready to try and body him into the stands and Messi stood there, took it and bounced JT. I also remember Manu Lanzini [his former West Ham teammate] coming back from Argentina duty and I was like: ‘Oh mate, what was Messi like?’ Manu’s a genius with the ball but he said: ‘I swear to you, when he passed me the ball, I was so nervous because he was on my team.’ Manu said Messi would be floating about in training and then he would think: ‘Oh, do you know what? I want to win this game.’ And he’d score six goals.”',\n",
       "  'The simple joy of football shines in Noble – as it will when he embraces the breaks from recruitment and monitoring mental health to step out on the academy pitch with teenage hopefuls to whom he can give a few pointers. All the headaches of being the Boleyn boy trying to keep up with clubs owned by countries will be forgotten for a while. And maybe, I suggest, the academy kids will look up to him as their local version of Messi.',\n",

A series of disastrous takeovers after relegation in 2007 sent the Addicks into freefall that has them languishing halfway down League One and facing an even more uncertain future under potentially yet another group of owners.',\n",
       "  '“Charlton is the most underperforming club in the country,” says Rick Everitt, the editor of fanzine Voice of the Valley since 1988. “That’s not to say that it should automatically be in the Premier League, although obviously it has that potential, but it should certainly be mid-table in the Championship, if it was decently run.”',\n",
       "  'The Danish-American owner Thomas Sandgaard, who bought the club in 2020 from East Street Investments, is believed to have granted a period of exclusivity to a consortium led by the former Sunderland executive Charlie Methven a few days before the surprise shootout victory over Brighton in the last round of the Carabao Cup on 21 December. That was the first time Charlton had beaten Premier League opposition since March 2007 and set up Tuesday’s trip to Manchester United in the quarter-final, with 9,000 fans expected to make the journey.',\n",

However, the technical director, Andy Scott, has been given only a six-week contract until the end of the January transfer window.',\n",

Both are owned by the previous owner Roland Duchâtelet, with the Belgian charging £500,000 a season for his former club to rent their home and the training ground under the agreement he struck with ESI.',\n",
       "  '“The biggest problem is that ESI in early 2020 allowed Duchâtelet to separate the liabilities of the football club from the assets, namely the Valley and Sparrows Lane,” says Everitt. “It is a return to the same problem we had in the 1980s and that was always going to be dangerous. Duchâtelet has no particular incentive to cooperate in any bid to put the football club back on a sound footing – he wants £50m and people that are seriously interested in Charlton won’t buy them without the freehold and they are not worth half that.',\n",

       "  'Everitt feels Sandgaard has been unrealistic from the beginning: “I think he’s a decent enough guy. I think he was well-intentioned but he was naive and like all of the people who have come in, he thought having had success elsewhere he would be able to turn the club around relatively easily and he’s been sadly disillusioned.”',\n",

       "  'Gianluca Vialli, who has died of pancreatic cancer aged 58, became the first Italian to manage a top-flight English football club when he took over at Chelsea in 1998, guiding them to FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners’ Cup trophies. However, he will be better remembered for his playing career as a dynamic, intelligent and versatile forward at Sampdoria and Juventus, as well as for Italy, with whom he won 59 caps between 1985 and 1992.',\n",
       "  'During a lengthy sojourn at Sampdoria in the 1980s and early 90s, Vialli won various honours, including the Italian League and the European Cup Winners’ Cup, but it was during his later, shorter stay at Juventus that he hit the greatest heights, captaining the side to a Champions League title in 1996.',\n",
       "  'Moving on to Chelsea immediately afterwards, he became a well-liked figure in west London, graduating from player to player-manager and then solely to manager – until, in the modern Chelsea tradition, he was sacked while still in full flow. A year followed as manager of Watford, after which he decided to concentrate on other interests, including television work and a backroom job with the Italian national side.',\n",
       "  'Vialli had an unusually wealthy background for a footballer. Born in Cremona in northern Italy, he was raised with his four older siblings in a huge 14th-century castle in the village of Belgioioso, not far from Milan, which had been bought by his father, a self-made millionaire.',\n",
       "  'In 1980, at the age of 16, he signed for his local club, Cremonese, in the third tier of the league, and four years later was bought by the Genoese Serie A team Sampdoria, who paired him up front with Roberto Mancini. Together they became known as the “goal twins” for their scoring exploits, as Sampdoria, who had won nothing of note up to that point, suddenly became a force in the Italian game.',\n",
       "  'Vialli’s first winner’s medal came in the Italian Cup in 1985, and under the Yugoslavian manager Vujadin Boškov he won another two cup finals, in 1988 and 1989, before appearing in the 1990 European Cup Winners’ Cup final, a 2-0 win against Anderlecht in which he scored both goals in extra time.',\n",
       "  'That year, Vialli also featured in the 1990 World Cup finals in Italy. He was dropped after missing a penalty in the second match against the USA, but returned for Italy’s semi-final against Argentina, which they lost on penalties.',\n",
       "  'A year later Sampdoria won the Serie A championship for the first and only time, finishing a comfortable five points clear of Internazionale at the end of the 1990-91 season, thanks in part to Vialli’s 19 goals as top scorer in the league. Qualifying for the European Cup, they reached the final at Wembley in 1992, but lost 1-0 to Barcelona in extra time, Vialli uncharacteristically missing three good chances before Ronald Koeman scored the winner.',\n",
       "  'Shortly afterwards he accepted an offer to join Juventus for a world-record fee of £12.5m, ushering in the end of Sampdoria’s great era of achievement. In Turin he won the 1993 Uefa Cup during his first season and then, under a new manager, Marcello Lippi, captained the side to a double of the 1994-95 Italian championship and the Italian Cup, creating another formidable goalscoring combination with Fabrizio Ravanelli in a side that also boasted Roberto Baggio, Alessandro Del Piero and Andreas Möller.',\n",
       "  'The crowning glory of his four-year spell at Juventus was victory in the 1996 Champions League final at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, where he lifted the trophy as captain after a win on penalties against Ajax.',\n",
       "  'By then in his early 30s, Vialli decided on a final move to the Premier League with Chelsea. He soon became a popular presence at Stamford Bridge, helped by his excellent command of English and use of colloquialisms, as well as his suave but likable aura.',\n",
       "  'He won the 1997 FA Cup in his first year at the club, but was limited to five minutes off the bench in the 2-0 win over Middlesbrough in the final, and for much of his time under manager Ruud Gullit he found his place in the side was hardly guaranteed.',\n",
       "  'When Gullit was sacked unexpectedly in early 1998, Vialli took over as player-manager, handing out glasses of champagne in the dressing room before his first match in charge, a League Cup semi-final second-leg win against Arsenal. That took them to the final, where they again beat Middlesbrough 2-0.',\n",
       "  'Having landed his first managerial honours within weeks of taking charge, Vialli also inherited a decent position in the European Cup Winners’ Cup, taking his side from the quarter-finals to the final and beating Stuttgart 1-0 in Stockholm to become, at the time, the youngest manager to win a European competition.',\n",
       "  'Third position in the Premier League at the end of the following 1998-99 season was Chelsea’s best showing in the top flight since 1970, and after stepping down as a player to concentrate solely on management, by the finish of 1999-2000 he had steered them to an FA Cup final win against Aston Villa and fifth place in the league. However, only five games into the next campaign, the club dispensed with his services.',\n",
       "  'Vialli’s subsequent move to manage Watford, who had just dropped out of the Premier League, was not nearly so successful. After a season in which the club finished 14th in the First Division he was sacked, prompting a lengthy legal dispute over substantial payments he said were due for the rest of his contract.',\n",
       "  'That was enough to put him off management for good, and he moved instead into work as a television analyst and commentator, mainly for Sky Italia. He also set up a sports investment company, Tifosy, and in 2019 was appointed delegation chief for the Italy team under his friend Mancini, a behind-the-scenes position he held until his death in London, where he had lived since his Chelsea days.',\n",
       "  'He is survived by his wife, Cathryn White-Cooper, whom he married in 2003, two daughters, Olivia and Sofia, his mother, Maria Teresa, his brothers, Nino, Marco and Maffo, and his sister, Mila.',\n",

       "  'Of all the iconic moments that have come to define the Premier League era, few stick in the mind quite like that which occurred at Elland Road on Monday 29 April 1996. Title-chasing Newcastle had just beaten Leeds 1-0 and interviewed after the game, their manager, Kevin Keegan, had a few things to get off his chest. He started agitated, got increasingly angry and by the end had turned the volume up to 11.',\n",
       "  'For many, the I will love it rant was pure Keegan, exposing him as a man too emotional for his own good and signalling the precise point that the destiny of the 1995-96 Premier League title race swung away from Newcastle and towards Manchester United.',\n",
       "  'Keegan had allowed Alex Ferguson to get inside his head, rising to the Scot’s bait after he had suggested during the final stage of an epic campaign that Leeds and Nottingham Forest, Newcastle’s third- and second-from-last opponents, would try less hard to beat the north-east side than they had his own. Ever the stirrer, Ferguson claimed Forest in particular would go easy on Newcastle given they were taking part in Stuart Pearce’s testimonial later that year. A favour for a favour, and all that.',\n",

       "  'United did get something at Middlesbrough; a 3-0 victory that sealed a third championship in four seasons. And really it was a formality given what occurred at the City Ground three days earlier – Newcastle’s 1-1 draw at Forest as the visitors dropped two points having taken a first-half lead. It was a mathematical blow following on from the psychological one Ferguson had landed prior to the Leeds game.',\n",
       "  'The result was a sickener for Newcastle, leaving them two points behind United going into the final day of the season, when as Ferguson’s side toasted glory at the Riverside Stadium, Newcastle were left to stew on what might have been following a 1-1 draw with Tottenham. A 12-point lead frittered away. Geordie dreams ripped at the seams.',\n",

The Entertainers’ best entertainer: Peter Beardsley.',\n",
       "  'It’s difficult to write about Beardsley in light of the 32-week ban from football he received in 2019 after being found guilty of using racist and abusive language towards Newcastle Under-23 players during his time as their coach. It was an upsetting and disgraceful episode and has come to overshadow the fact Beardsley was one hell of a footballer; a technically gifted, highly creative forward who has never truly received the credit he deserved. There are several reasons for that and undoubtedly among them are his appearance and demeanour. That shuffling running style, that pudding-bowl haircut, that thick, lispy Geordie accent; Beardsley is far from the sexiest player this country has ever produced but he is arguably its most talented.',\n",
       "  'A No 10 who rarely played with No 10 on his back, Beardsley’s mastery of a football was beguiling. It rarely left his foot, even as he pulled off his trademark move of dribbling through one challenge after another, often in tight spaces and at speed. As is the case with most talented players, that came from an allying of natural ability with constant practice, which in Beardsley’s case involved running with a ball from his home in Forest Hall to Wallsend Boys Club, the Tyneside youth setup that had a hand in launching not only Beardsley’s career but also those of Steve Bruce, Alan Shearer and Michael Carrick.',\n",
       "  'The ball Beardsley used to dribble with was a penny floater, which for younger readers was made of plastic and had a mind of its own. It was a pain to play with but that was the point as far as Beardsley was concerned: learn to get to grips with one of those and the leather version would be a doddle in comparison.',\n",
       "  'It worked. Beardsley grew up to not only be someone capable of manoeuvring in tight spaces and at speed but also with either foot and from awkward angles. He also had excellent spatial awareness and an often under-appreciated vicious finish. Beardsley may have come across as a dozy dope but there was bloody-mindedness to go with all that talent.',\n",
       "  'And all those gifts were on show at the City Ground on Thursday 2 May 1996 as Newcastle went for title broke against Forest.',\n",
       "  'A little over half an hour had been played when David Batty, standing just inside Forest’s half, fired a pass towards Beardsley, who was lurking outside the area but side-on and with the opposition back four in front of him. Matters were not helped by the ball bouncing as it reached Beardsley, but Newcastle’s captain did not panic. Instead, and in one movement, he seized possession and turned so he was facing towards goal.',\n",

Again there was no panic as he waited for the ball to drop and, after it had, drove from right to left, brushing off Gemmill and Chettle with ease before poking the ball through Alf-Inge Haaland’s legs and surging into the area.',\n",
       "  'There was still work to do given Haaland’s attempt at a last-ditch tackle, not to mention the fact Beardsley was running away from goal. Once again – no panic. Instead he took a touch to bring the ball under control before lashing a soaring, unstoppable drive past Mark Crossley and into the top corner.',\n",
       "  '“A gem of a goal by a gem of a player,” exclaimed Martin Tyler in commentary, and he wasn’t wrong. The strike was voted Match of the Day’s goal of the month and in the space of five seconds and half a dozen touches, with left and right foot, captured Beardsley at best. ',\n",
       "  'Liverpool and Everton supporters may disagree with that assessment given the high-quality displays Beardsley delivered for the Merseyside clubs between the late 80s and the early 90s, while some Newcastle fans would perhaps argue he performed better for their club during his first spell at St James’ Park, from 1983-87. That may all be true but there is no denying that, in the years after he returned to the north-east, Beardsley was a consistently dazzling member of one of the most thrilling teams this country has seen. And what made his contribution to Keegan’s Newcastle especially remarkable was that he was way into his 30s – 35 on the night of the goal against Forest and going on to perform strongly for his boyhood team for a further 15 months.',\n",
       "  'It should also be remembered that as well as being a talented forward in his own right, Beardsley was an excellent foil for others. John Aldridge, Ian Rush, Andy Cole and Les Ferdinand are just some of the strikers who thrived alongside him at club level while with England there was Gary Lineker.',\n",
       "  '“The person that helped me the most was Peter Beardsley,” said the Match of the Day presenter. “Phenomenal player. Unbelievably unselfish. My goalscoring record when Peter was in the England side was pretty much a goal a game and I owe that to him.”',\n",

       "  '“When you think about refereeing it’s very much about confidence,” says Howard Webb. “It’s a mental discipline, you need resilience to be successful at it. My job is to make sure that referees are going into their job feeling confident and supported.”',\n",
       "  'After eight years away, the most successful referee of the Premier League era has come back to the English game. His contract overseeing officials in the US had come to an end and he had been in discussions about coming home in some form for a while, but Webb’s appointment as the first chief refereeing officer in the elite game has the feel of a necessity, as – by common consent – the men in black need all the help they can get.',\n",
       "  'At the peak of his refereeing career, in 2010, Webb took charge of a Champions League final and a World Cup final within a month of each other. He was also labelled a secret Manchester United fan before social media made accusations of bias fashionable. So, on and off the pitch, he has some sense of how refereeing works. Now he will be expected to spend the money assigned by the Premier League as part of its Elite Referee Development Plan and deliver on its expected returns.',\n",
       "  'Webb’s experience working in the States has obviously given him some ideas, but there remain some real challenges that won’t be easily unpicked, most obviously in the form of VAR. Webb calls himself a “big exponent” of video refereeing, an attitude he dates back to seeing Thierry Henry handle the ball against the Republic of Ireland on the way to the 2010 World Cup, and his own experience of missing Nigel de Jong’s kung fu kick on Xabi Alonso in the final. “That decision lives with me,” he says. “I wanted to get it right, but I clearly didn’t see it right. So why not have the opportunity to go and rectify the error in real time there and then?”',\n",
       "  'The role of VAR is clear to Webb: it should be there to provide peace of mind to officials, not re-referee the game. “My job is to make sure we get the consistency around the question VARs have been told to ask themselves: was [the referee’s decision] clearly wrong?” he says. But he also acknowledges that the simple existence of the technology can create unintentional consequences.',\n",
       "  'He describes VAR as a safety net, and referees as tightrope walkers. The safety net can change the referee’s approach to a task and make them less concerned about making a mistake. “A lot of our work has to be around making sure they walk on that tightrope as if the safety net wasn’t there,” he says. He also wants referees to be more willing to reject the advice of a VAR, especially when they are called to the pitchside monitor, but knows too that referees are listening to peers who might be conveying their advice forcefully. “I’ve never refereed with [VAR] so how it affects your psyche as a ref I don’t really know personally,” he admits.',\n",
       "  'A second great challenge is to improve referees’ decision-making in the first place. Webb insists that standards have improved since he put down his whistle in 2014, but says that the speed and complexity of elite football has risen even faster. He also accepts that, whatever the statistics say, any improvement is not regularly perceived by fans. “Clearly the fact that there’s been a change, that I’ve been brought in, suggests there’s a feeling that we need to raise standards even further,” he says. “There’s an expectation they will get better.”',\n",
       "  'Alongside an expanded recruitment programme and more coaching for referees (with former Premier League officials Jon Moss and Martin Atkinson already recruited in such roles) Webb believes that consistent communication will be key to improving things. In the US he got into the habit of setting up referees and officials with broadcasters after each round of fixtures to discuss contentious decisions and believes this both informed media coverage and broke down mystique. He is hopeful of doing something similar in England but accepts even this comes with risks. “You don’t want to turn referees into celebrities,” he says. “But as it stands there’s clearly a feeling that perception [of refereeing] could be better and the level of transparency could be better. And I think that’s right.”',\n",

       "  \"Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\",\n",
       "  'Webb says that in the US, where football is an insurgent sport looking to challenge established favourites, the message when talking about refereeing and VAR was “don’t kill the project”. Allow for criticism, yes, but get behind what the game was trying to achieve. A different kind of attitude will be necessary in England if the rehabilitation of refereeing is to be achieved.',\n",
       "  '“I think there’s probably less forgiveness here, generally speaking,” Webb says. “The relationship with football here is engrained, that leads to some resistance to change. The scrutiny any information comes under over here is different to anything you get over there.”',\n",
       "  'Aspirations of transparency and openness can often get waylaid when a desire for change meets the reality of English football. But Webb has succeeded before and done the hard yards of learning before taking on the impossible job, refereeing edition. In an age of ubiquitous media he also has the charisma and self-confidence required of a leading figure in the game. If the aim is to convince the nation that a dubious handball penalty decision is the result of simple human frailty and not the result of a sophisticated conspiracy, he has as good a chance as most.'],\n",

He also won the FA Cup with United in 2016 but, much as Carrick emphasises his love for the competition, he knows Steve Gibson, Boro’s owner, hired him to return the team to the Premier League – and ideally this season.',\n",
       "  '“I’m a massive fan of the FA Cup; as a kid, watching the final in May was a huge day in the calendar for me and the excitement doesn’t change,” he says.

I want to beat Brighton; seeing if you’re good enough to pull it off on big occasions is what you’re in football for. But the measurement for us now is the league and where we end up. It’s all about where we finish the season.”',\n",

If Boro do go up, Carrick’s decision to appoint Jonathan Woodgate as his first-team coach will have been fully vindicated. Considering Woodgate was sacked as Boro’s manager and replaced by Neil Warnock two-and-a-half years ago it initially looked a slightly left-field recruitment but he and Carrick are tactical soulmates.',\n",

Significantly, the former centre back, who won eight England caps, is credited with helping Dael Fry and Darragh Lenihan forge a formidabledefensive partnership. Both players, Fry especially, had fallen out of favour under Wilder but where Boro’s former manager could be abrasively critical of individuals, Carrick and Woodgate prefer a more emollient, arm-around-the-shoulder approach.

       "  'It is 10 years since a challenging first six months in charge of Liverpool came to a head at Christmas for Brendan Rodgers. A couple of weeks on from a home loss to Aston Villa, a bruising Boxing Day defeat at Stoke, which saw them leapfrogged by Tony Pulis’s side and slide towards mid-table, only crystallised the desire for reinforcements. The next month Rodgers recruited Daniel Sturridge from Chelsea and Philippe Coutinho from Internazionale, two crucial pieces in the jigsaw as Liverpool went agonisingly close to winning the Premier League the following season.',\n",
       "  'Before Rodgers takes his Leicester team to Anfield on Friday, he finds himself in a similar pickle, reeling from another Boxing Day defeat but at the same time confident he has pinpointed the areas in his team that urgently need improvement. Rodgers is in no doubt about the additions his Leicester squad require: a speedy winger, a left-back and another centre-back are the priorities for January. That victory at Liverpool would be Leicester’s first win against an opponent in the top 12 of the division this season perhaps speaks volumes of the absence of quality across the squad.',\n",
       "  'A pale performance in the 3-0 home loss to Newcastle prompted Rodgers to take the unprecedented step of cancelling his players’ day off, scheduled for Tuesday, for the first time in his 14-year managerial career. A team meeting helped flush out the worrying performance. Daniel Amartey’s wild swipe gifted Newcastle a third-minute penalty, converted by Chris Wood, and four minutes later Miguel Almirón breezed into the box to double their lead. What made him take such action? “Just the ‘why?’” he says. “Why after the games that we had and the rest that we had and the work that we had, why we started in that manner. We were able to talk it through and open up and conversations like that allow you to move on.”',\n",
       "  'Rodgers was critical of his players’ attitude and it was a difficult display to swallow given Leicester’s form before the World Cup break. They had kept eight clean sheets in their previous 10 matches and their sole defeat in their five league matches before the division was put on pause was a slender one to Manchester City, courtesy of Kevin De Bruyne’s magical free-kick. Rodgers’s words in the buildup to that game felt even more pertinent afterwards. “As we know in football, a pat on the back is only a short distance away from a slap on the backside,” he said. “You’ve got to keep focused.”',\n",
       "  'It was a dispiriting restart for Rodgers and Leicester but he is hopeful his team will not be winded by the defeat. “It’s about rebooting that [confidence] and getting it back again and knowing that the biggest thing in the Premier League you need to have is that attitude and desire to win the games and then the talents then come through from that,” Rodgers says. “I think the players knew and I’ve got a really good group of honest players here who were so disappointed, especially how we had built up into it. But now the next game we have that opportunity to beat the next challenge.”',\n",
       "  'The task for Leicester’s head of recruitment, Martyn Glover, lured from Southampton earlier this year, and the director of football, Jon Rudkin, is to bolster a squad that has gone stale in places. In the summer Rodgers had targeted a healthy shake-up but ended up with one outfield signing, the centre-back Wout Faes, who has impressed and developed into something of a cult hero since signing from Reims following the £75m sale of Wesley Fofana. Leicester’s finances have been smoothed by taking a loan with the Australian bank Macquarie, secured against the £46.3m owed by Chelsea for Fofana. Chelsea will pay another instalment of the Fofana deal in February.',\n",
       "  'Liverpool, of course, is always a special game for Rodgers. The LMA manager of the year award still provides a reminder of how close Liverpool came to clinching the Premier League in 2014, when Manchester City pipped them to the title.

There would have been talk of dressing room unrest, of players going to their Russian owner to voice their feelings, of Guus Hiddink coming to the rescue in an interim role.

Garnacho turned up late to two meetings and was offered only one friendly appearance over the summer as a result.',\n",
       "  'Professionalism is not a concept fully embraced by many 18-year-olds but it should come with maturity and an improvement in his attitude has already been noted since Ten Hag’s critique.

       "  'The perceived character flaws away from the pitch go against what he shows on it. Garnacho has a lust for football, a desire to play every minute to show everything he is capable of because of his unshakable belief in his own ability. Not being a regular in a top-six Premier League team at 18 would not be a source of frustration for many but Garnacho is already desperate to prove he is the best option for Ten Hag on the left wing. What he needs to accept, however, is that at his tender age he does not possess everything required.',\n",

He is desperate to get possession whenever he can and run fearlessly at defenders, unperturbed by previous failures against his opponents. There is speed and skill, a new trick for every dribble to try to outfox a full-back who thinks he has his number. However there is still a need to learn how and when to use each attribute. He needs to know that sometimes the quickest way to goal does not always involve an extra trick, because the space is straight ahead when someone has the pace, as shown by Garnacho’s direct dribbling to score against Real Sociedad. That finish and his late winner against Fulham in the Premier League are evidence of his composure and unfazed nature in pressured situations.',\n",

Understanding he is not the finished product is important and the former Atléticp Madrid youth player recognises this. He works incredibly hard on the training ground to get better in the aspect of the game he is yet to perfect. Since arriving in 2020, Garnacho has been following a development plan and exceeded expectations in the process. United have been understanding of his prodigious talent, which needs to be handled differently to others.',\n",
       "  'Aided by a robust physicality, Garnacho will be able to cope with the rigours of the Premier League in the long term.
