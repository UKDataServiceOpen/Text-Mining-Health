    "Webscraping refers to the extraction of data from a website. This information is collected and then exported into a format that is more useful, perhaps a spreadsheet. Of course, we could just copy and paste this information manually into a spreadsheet, but that's time-consuming and unreasonable if we want to extract large amounts of data. Instead, we can use Python webscraping packages to access the information we want and display it in a logical format.\n",

Basically, it allows two applications to talk to each other. For instance, think of your Weather app on your phone, this app software \"talks\" to the weather bureau's software system which contains the daily weather data. The result of this conversation is daily weather updates on your phone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both webscraping (as a process) and APIs (as a set of procedures and protocals) share the same goal: to access web data. The former allows you to extract data from any website via scraping software, whilst the latter gives you direct access to the data you want. In this notebook I'll be using a combination of the two."

    "So before I can even begin to think about webscraping, I need to locate some relevant data. I could just type \"women's football WSL\" into google and click on each individual link and try to scrape this data... but again, that's a) time-consuming b) uncreative. Instead, I did a brief google search \"Scrape news articles Python\" and came across NewsAPI. This API returns search results for current and historic news articles, and the results include information on: title, author, source, date, and url of the news article. It also allows you to input multiple terms so that you can grab as many relevant links as you can! \n",

       "[['Arsenal’s winning run was ended in dramatic style at the Emirates while Brighton and Liverpool also produced a thriller',\n",
       "  'Manchester United’s second win against one of Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City, and first away win against any of the traditional top three, was significant. The 3-2 defeat of Arsenal at the Emirates spoke to a real shift in the resilience of Marc Skinner’s side. Having taken the lead, United’s collapse early in the second half, conceding twice, looked to be following a familiar pattern. Instead, in front of an impressive away end, United roared back to equalise and then win it in injury time. Skinner called it a full Manchester United performance. “Our job is to bring the women under that same banner of: we might go down but we’re never beaten,” he said. They were helped by some poor defending for Katie Zelem’s lethal set-pieces, which provided goals two and three, but there is little doubt that United, after a bruising 3-1 defeat to Chelsea, are serious contenders.

       "  'Perhaps the biggest winners following Manchester United’s 3-2 defeat of Arsenal were Chelsea. Having beaten United 3-1 before the international break, the Blues pounced on the opportunity to go top of the table, albeit with an extra game played, with a 3-0 home win over Tottenham. Emma Hayes returned to the touchline following her emergency hysterectomy, but the team had gone unbeaten in her absence and, in many ways, transition in and out had been seamless. “There is often this sense that coaching has to be done from coaches to players,” she mused after. “Instead I want players to be coaches on the pitch. So Sam Kerr said to me that when she scored against Manchester United the other day – when her touch had been all over the place in maybe three or four subsequent moves –just before that Guro [Reiten] had told her ‘Sam, the next time the ball comes, turn and shoot.’ It just made me feel so confident.” SW',\n",

On Sunday, they surrendered a lead once more, leaving interim manager, Amy Merricks, lamenting her side’s tendency to concede. It was deja-vu as the Seagulls found themselves 3-1 up at the break. A capitulation followed, however, as Liverpool produced an inspired comeback. Despite a tough run of form, Matt Beard’s side have shown character and they took their opportunities with Shanice van de Sanden as the catalyst. The substitute pulled one back before providing the assist for a dramatic equaliser. Rachel Furness was the player of the hour, bravely diving in with her head – as she so often does – at a cross in the 91st minute to send her team home with a valuable point. SD',\n",

       "  'When your luck is out in football, it really is out. An 87th-minute winner from West Ham’s Izzy Atkinson – her first goal for the club – struck a dagger through Leicester hearts. Having what looked an equaliser disallowed minutes later only added to the pain. The Foxes, propping up the table, produced a solid performance on Sunday against an out-of-sorts West Ham. For the most part, they were brave and compact, controlling possession and tenacious with it. Their inability to convert chances, however, made them pay once more. Before the game, Willie Kirk’s side had the lowest shot conversion rate in the league at 3.5% and that problem was highlighted in this encounter: they created 17 shots to West Ham’s eight but only managed three on target. Kirk was keen to emphasise the positives post-match but he will know how valuable even a point would have been. With Chelsea next things do not get any easier for this Leicester side as they try to find a way to turn their fortunes around. SD',\n",

On Sunday, at Villa Park, they took the lead in the seventh minute but once again defensive errors let them down and they ended up losing 3-1. It went wrong late in the first half with Rachel Daly being left unmarked to head in the equaliser. True, it was a superb header but she had far too much room to execute it. Daly then made it 2-1 from a corner and it could even have been 3-1 early in the second half but Kirsty Hanson missed a glorious oppotunity. The Reading goalkeeper, Jacqueline Burns, was then sent off for a challenge on Daly and the England international completed her hat-trick from the spot.

       "  '“Un Pari Che Sa Di Gloria” read the headline of il Romanista a fortnight ago: “A draw which has the taste of glory”. Champions League debutants Roma had just held Wolfsburg, one of the European greats, to a draw at home. It was a result that put progression into the knockout stages firmly in the Giallorosse’s grasp, sending a signal around the continent that there is very much a new kid in town.',\n",
       "  'Since acquiring the Serie A licence from Res Roma in 2018, Roma have made solid progress. Last season – Alessandro Spugna’s first in charge – they finished second and qualified for Europe for the first time. The ambition to be among the European elite is clear and their form has backed it up. Unbeaten in 15, they have leapt to the top of Serie A, leading Juventus by a comfortable six-point margin. They won the Coppa Italia in 2021 and that was followed by the Supercoppa Italia last month.',\n",
       "  '“We are a very ambitious club, and we want to try to win as many titles as possible,” Spugna tells Moving the Goalposts. “We know that to do this we need to improve. We already managed to get one trophy this season, the Super Cup, to which we attached a great importance. We are doing very well in the Italian league … as far as the Champions League is concerned, this is a dream. We want to keep dreaming. It’s very hard but it allows you to get better because you have to measure yourself against very big teams.”',\n",

The striker Valentina Giacinti arrived from Milan in the summer and has already made an impact. Rome has been home to Brazil’s centurion, Andressa, since 2019 while the experienced Austrian defender, Carina Wenninger, arrived on loan in the summer.',\n",
       "  '“There has been great work since the foundation of this club,” Spugna says. “Every year, we’ve been adding bits. This is a club made up of ambitious people with a great desire to improve.”',\n",
       "  '“The level has increased in Italy thanks to the advent of professional women’s teams. In the last two years, big international players landed in the Italian league and we are one of the clubs who have invested a lot in important players. The league continues to grow, but of course to get to the level of Lyon, Wolfsburg, Barcelona, Chelsea … it will still take time because they are ahead of us. We are trying to bridge this gap and I believe we are on the right track.”',\n",
       "  'As the women’s game continues to develop, a historic club such as Roma having a notable women’s side is key. They are a team that like to play on the front foot, but their manager is pragmatic about his side’s approach: “I like a team that dominates teams,” he says. “Domestically, we are managing to do this because we have a lot of quality … that’s what we are also trying to do in the Champions League. But of course, at this level, which is much higher, it’s not always possible and sometimes you have to defend.”',\n",
       "  'They are unbeaten in Europe this season, winning five of their seven matches. The highlight was that confidence-inducing draw with Wolfsburg, who they meet again on Thursday evening. “It meant a lot to us,” reflects Spugna. “Not only because of the final score, but because of the performance. We were brave on the pitch. We not only defended the result, but we tried to win the game.”',\n",
       "  'The pride Spugna feels is evident. However, he is not one to rest on his laurels with a clear focus to push Roma to the next level. “I landed in this big club and city, living a dream,” he says. “But now I’m here, I’m very happy and very proud. I’m happy that we’re doing good work, which is the most important thing. You need to keep doing this because in football, you need to forget what you did yesterday, and you need to focus on the future.”',\n",

       "  'Right to her core, Ashleigh Plumptre is a Leicester City player. Growing up in Melton Mowbray, about a 30 minutes’ drive from the city, the 24-year-old defender played for the club’s centre of excellence from the age of eight to 14, having started playing a few years earlier for a local girls’ side.',\n",
       "  '“I was one of those kids that just always wanted to be active,” Plumptre says. She recalls getting home from school, dropping off her bags before playing football outside until “my mum would say I had to be home for dinner”.',\n",
       "  'As a teenager she temporarily left her hometown club, where she would later sign her first professional contract. As Leicester’s senior women were relegated from the third tier in 2013, Plumptre was tempted by Birmingham, a founding member of the Women’s Super League, where she joined their under-17 squad. After that followed a brief period at Derby, before she joined Notts County, who were then a WSL side.',\n",
       "  'In 2016, Plumptre moved to the US on a scholarship at the University of Southern California, where she majored in human biology. Her college side won the National Championship that year and were invited to the White House. Of that time, she says: “It influenced so many things in my life, and not just football, I found out more about myself, what I’m passionate about.”',\n",
       "  'But her ambitions never strayed far from returning to Leicester. By this point, the club had risen through the ranks to the Championship. After graduating in 2019 and despite interest from a few WSL sides, Plumptre was set on Leicester. Her father, also her agent, approached the club directly. The deal she signed has since extended it until at least next June.',\n",
       "  '“[It] meant a lot to me to sign for Leicester because it was the club I’ve always supported and I grew up here,” she says. “I felt valued here, and I felt like I had a purpose here in trying to bring success to the club.”',\n",
       "  'After joining, Plumptre played a key role in securing Leicester’s promotion to the WSL for the 2021-22 season. Money likely helped, too: her team went fully professional in August 2020, after it was bought by King Power. “All the investment … it showed in the players that we brought in, and [promotion] was everybody’s mindset from the beginning,” she says.',\n",
       "  'Football, though, is far more than just a sport to Plumptre. “I have to have a purpose in it,” she says. “I struggle just to play it.” Case in point: she is an ambassador for Menphys, a local charity supporting young people with disabilities, which has supported her brother, who is autistic. (Plumptre has two younger brothers and a sister, all half-siblings.)',\n",
       "  'It was also in this mindset that, during the coronavirus lockdowns, Plumptre began thinking more about her Nigerian heritage: her paternal grandfather was born in Lagos.',\n",
       "  'Soon, she was talking to her 12-year-old sister about it. “Even though we have the same dad, we both have a Nigerian dad and a white mum, she looks a little different to me and has experienced things in school that I never had,” she says. “Most people just assume that I’m white. I identify as being mixed heritage. But my sister … she identifies as being black.”',\n",
       "  '“I felt a bit helpless in that,” she says of learning about her sister’s experiences. Plumptre had played for England’s youth squads, including at Under-23 level but this year switched her allegiance to Nigeria, making her official debut in February. She says: “That’s where I’m like: ‘OK, Nigeria would be good for me to do because then I can experience the culture more, I can come back and teach her about our heritage.’ That was the trigger for me.”',\n",

She has also “realised how lucky I’ve been to just have been born in this country, the opportunities that I’ve been blessed with”. She adds: “My Nigerian teammates, for example, they’ve worked so hard but sometimes they don’t get the same opportunities based upon the teams that they’re playing in, the lack of exposure that they have. It’s a privilege to play with them.” Next year, she hopes to make the squad to represent Nigeria at the World Cup.',\n",

Four months on, the signs are that interest in women’s and girls’ football is continuing to soar, amid a flurry of record attendances across the pyramid. However, scratch beneath the surface and it is clear more needs to be done, with many issues still to be resolved, not least around facilities and accessibility.',\n",
       "  'As the Government embarks on a review of the entire women’s game, chaired by England icon Karen Carney, we ask how the game can make the most of the surge in popularity.',\n",

       "  'Kelly Chambers, manager of WSL club Reading, who play their home fixtures at the Select Car Leasing Stadium, which they share with Reading’s men, said: “All of us as clubs and the FA knew the biggest thing we wanted to try and change this year was getting [more] fans in the door and trying to build that fan base. It needs to keep growing.”',\n",
       "  'Two-thirds of top-flight teams are averaging more than 3,400 fans this term, and Arsenal have averaged nearly 24,000, thanks to playing two league games at the Emirates Stadium.',\n",
       "  'Speaking after her side’s loss to Chelsea in front of 38,350 at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, Tottehnam manager Rehanne Skinner said: “It’s great to have these one-off kind of hits but I think the most important thing is that everybody’s average attendance goes up, so still there’s a lot of work to do.”',\n",
       "  'After removing the “big-stadium” matches, the WSL is averaging 2,770 this season, above last season’s figure, which was below 2,000. Chelsea manager Emma Hayes – who says women’s football tickets are “too cheap” – believes WSL clubs are “all outgrowing our small stadiums”, with the 46-year-old adding that she would like to see teams playing between eight and 12 games per year at their men’s team’s home.',\n",
       "  'It is not just at the elite level where facilities are a key part of the discussion about how to grow the game. For some, access to a regular pitch of any kind is hard.',\n",
       "  'Bex Francis-Jones, a former captain of Manchester United Women, knows that feeling well. She is involved in the heartbeat of the grass-roots level, as both player and chairperson at Northwich Vixens LFC. The club are run entirely by volunteers – with even former Wales international Dean Saunders among those to have offered coaching services. The Cheshire club play in the North West Women’s Regional League Division One South, the sixth tier of the pyramid. Players pay to play – £20 per month, as well as a £30 signing-on-fee – but have their kit provided, thanks to local sponsors.',\n",
       "  '“We’re always wanting to progress, we’re just struggling to grow any bigger because of a lack of facilities,” Francis-Jones says. “In Northwich, there aren’t enough facilities for the teams.”',\n",
       "  'Francis-Jones has been the club’s chair for around 10 years, and says extra interest since the Euros has enabled a new Wildcats – an FA participation scheme for five-to-11-year-old girls – group to set up in Northwich, and they have teams at all age groups.',\n",
       "  'Meanwhile, their first and development teams have pitch-access problems. The Vixens play their home matches in the neighbouring village of Lostock Gralam, sharing the men’s team’s venue, but Francis-Jones says: “It’s a grass pitch and the draining system is diabolical – it’s waterlogged quite often. Then there’s our training pitch – we train on a Wednesday night but only on half a pitch, around 40 players on half a pitch, from 8-10pm.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'It’s the only slot we can get, but the development team has 16-to-17-year-olds with college, A levels, and some travelling from Altrincham, and they need to leave by 9pm to get to bed to catch college buses at 6am.” She adds that – together with local men’s side Northwich Victoria – they are “actively looking” for land to build on and talking to the Cheshire FA. She adds: “We’re looking to grow a disability team and a walking football team, but we can’t because we haven’t got the facilities.”',\n",
       "  'Last year, when launching a new grass-roots strategy, the FA set a target of adding 5,000 pitches by 2024 and it is understood more than 3,000 have been built.',\n",

       "  'Rachel Daly was Aston Villa’s big summer signing, and one who has put Villa at the top of the rest of the WSL. Broadly speaking, the midtable of the WSL have teams that are well-organized and have a good defensive shape. The big difference between Aston Villa, Tottenham, and Everton is that Aston Villa have a striker who scores goals. Rachel Daly was often prolific in the NWSL, with Houston, and she’s the joint top scorer in the WSL this season, with 8 goals, albeit with 3 from the penalty spot. Still, 5 non-penalty goals puts her level with Sam Kerr (and Frida Maanum). Daly can drop deep to knit play, but she feasts on crosses, with service coming from Alisha Lehmann and Kirsty Hanson. Kenza Dalí joined in the summer and has added creativity to Villa’s midfield. Villa are third in the WSL in crosses into the penalty area per game, with Hanson, Lehmann and right back Sarah Mayling playing the most per game. Mayling is also Villa’s top progresser from the back. ',\n",
       "  'Arsenal have had a tactical rejig in recent weeks. With Beth Mead out and Lina Hurtig out, and Mana Iwabuchi not favoured, Katie McCabe has been the right winger almost by default, as soon as she wasn’t required at left back. McCabe plays as an inverted winger on the right hand side, which is contrary to how Beth Mead plays on the right. McCabe will act almost as a third central midfielder or #10, which allows Vivianne Miedema to push higher up. As a result, there’s space on the right hand side. On Wednesday, Stina Blackstenius exploited that space to set up Miedema’s winner against Juventus, with Blackstenius’ cross set up by a dink from Leah Williamson. Williamson is unlikely to start, having started midweek, but Rafaelle Souza should return. Rafaelle has the ability to play diagonals, but also plays longer passes down the wing or into the channel. ',\n",
       "  'Stina Blackstenius assisted Vivianne Miedema’s winner against Juventus, but she hasn’t scored in over a month for Arsenal, last netting against Leicester City. In this four match scoreless run, Blackstenius has had chances, but just hasn’t been able to convert, with an xG from the four games of 1.6. Shots haven’t been lacking; she’s taken 13, and has been somewhat unlucky, having hit the woodwork, but Arsenal will need her to find her scoring boots again. Essentially, the underlying numbers are fine, but with two crucial games after Villa, against Lyon and Zurich in the Champions League, a goal for Blackstenius would be very valuable heading into the final stretch of matches in the year.

       "  'This weekend saw the Women’s Super League take the spotlight in English football, with the Premier League on international break for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and the England team beginning their campaign on Monday lunchtime, with a 6-2 win over Iran.',\n",
       "  'The WSL produced some spectacular football – Manchester United’s thrilling late comeback to defeat Arsenal 2-3 at Emirates, the fast-paced 3-3 draw between Liverpool and Brighton, and some great football as reigning WSL champions Chelsea beat Spurs 3-0.',\n",
       "  'The WSL also drew in impressive crowds. \\xa0Chelsea women broke their home attendance record as they played at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2019. \\xa0More than 40,000 supporters were at Emirates Stadium on Saturday evening as Arsenal hosted Man Utd Women.',\n",
       "  'The Championship saw some good attendance too as Sheffield United Women drew a record crowd of 11,137 to Bramall Lane for their 2-0 defeat to London City Lionesses.',\n",
       "  'But how do we do this on a consistent basis and turn occasional fans into dedicated supporters who follow the WSL clubs week in and week out?',\n",
       "  'With growing crowds come growing pains.. \\xa0',\n",
       "  'Chelsea’s home, Kingsmeadow, only has a capacity of 4,850. \\xa0Arsenal usually play at Meadow Park, which can hold a capacity of 4,500.',\n",
       "  'The success of the Lionesses at Euro 2022 saw interest in women’s football in England increase dramatically, but WSL teams are generally performing in their usual surroundings, which raises the question of how do we grow attendance when women’s home ground matches are already being sold-out on a regular basis?',\n",
       "  'Let’s take a look at some WSL manager’s views:',\n",
       "  'Arsenal faced Tottenham at the men’s ground earlier this season, winning 4-0 in September in front of a WSL record-breaking crowd of 47,367.\\xa0 After the match Eidevall said It is so important for growing the game to make sure that these occasions are not one-offs. \\xa0If you’re doing that, then I think the chances increase that you can repeat it again because of course, it’s not going to be a sustainable solution to give away tickets for games. \\xa0Let’s be honest, football clubs need revenues and ticket sales are important for revenues, he added.',\n",
       "  'Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall said of the Emirates: I think it’s one of our two homes. And from the time I’ve been here, we feel more and more that this is our home.',\n",
       "  'Arsenal play their home Champions League matches at Emirates Stadium this season. While these games have drawn much lower crowds, they are ensuring the women’s club game at England’s biggest stadia is becoming normal.',\n",
       "  'At her post-match press conference on Sunday, Chelsea Manager Emma Hayes said: I’d like to be here [at Stamford Bridge] more. \\xa0I think we all know that solving the conundrum in the women’s game around what do we do from small stadia, is there a medium-term plan to go to medium-size stadiums before eventually everyone comes home to the large stadium?\\xa0 I don’t know, but I’m absolutely certain we’re all outgrowing our small stadiums, that I’m sure of.',\n",
       "  'I think one of the biggest things that perhaps we don’t talk enough about is how cheap women’s football is, Hayes said. I really believe we have to increase the overall pricing structure if we’re to play more in these places, because there is a cost implication to it.',\n",
       "  'I think the audiences are there, not for every game, but certainly for maybe eight games, 12 games a year. \\xa0We have to be more ambitious for ourselves. \\xa0Is it too cheap to watch women’s football? \\xa0I think it is, especially for the top games.',\n",
       "  'Arsenal & Chelsea fans adult tickets generally cost about £8 to £9.\\xa0 For bigger matches such as Arsenal v Chelsea at Emirates Stadium on 15th January 2023, adult tickets are still only £12.\\xa0 Tickets are available to purchase here.',\n",
       "  'Reading boss Kelly Chambers, speaking before their 3-1 defeat to Aston Villa, played at Villa Park, she said: Off the back of the Euros, we knew the biggest change we wanted to see happen this year was getting more fans in the door, watching the games but not only that, grow the fanbase too.\\xa0 It’s all well and good having fans turn up to the stadium every so often, but what we want is to ensure they are embedded into our experience and leave them wanting more.',\n",
       "  'A big change for this weekend’s big stadium matches was away ends. \\xa0Usually WSL crowds are mixed, but on Saturday night, the Manchester United players celebrated wildly with their travelling fans.\\xa0 Manager Mark Skinner said of away ends, after the Arsenal – Man Utd match: Whether it’s concrete proof or not, if you give us away ends you will get a lot of fans through the door. \\xa0Tonight was a good indicator of that. We just had to go to them at the end, it was good to know where they were.',\n",
       "  'In summary, there is definitely a conundrum.. everyone wants more bums on seats for WSL games but nobody really has enough seats to put those proverbial bums on..',\n",
       "  'Away ends is a given in men’s football, shouldn’t it be the case in womens – particularly for the big games at least?',\n",
       "  'Ridiculously low prices need to increase, not to exorbitant levels like the men’s game but somewhere above single figures per ticket would be a marked improvement in helping to finance the women’s game.',\n",

       "  'Apologies that it has taken me a little longer to write the second part of the ladies history Gooners but hopefully it will be worth the wait..',\n",
       "  'If you missed the first history of Arsenal Women you can read it here…',\n",
       "  'In case you didn’t know this, Arsenal Women play most of their home matches at Meadow Park, home of Vanarama National League side Boreham Wood, in Hertfordshire Borehamwood of course.',\n",
       "  'The stadium has a capacity of 4,500 and in more recent times Arsenal’s home UEFA Women’s Champions League matches are also played here. Also, in more recent times and due to the growing connection with the Arsenal men’s side it is with great pride that the women are now permitted to play competitive matches at the Emirates stadium, when of course the ground is not being used for the men’s matches and if not equal to, they draw nearly as much crowd as the men do.',\n",
       "  'After mainly male dominated roles at the helm of Arsenal women with Vic Akers the protagonist at the wheel for 22 years and then Tony Gervaise at the helm for just one season after taking over from Akers in 2009-2010, the managerial role would soon become all female dominated for the next few years after Gervaise resigned after only eight months in charge, claiming “a lack of clarity about who was in charge.”',\n",
       "  'Gervaise remained at Arsenal though as he swapped roles with reserve coach Laura Harvey in an unusual development, as she became first-team manager and Gervaise became reserve coach.',\n",
       "  'Harvey’s appointment marked the clubs first female coach in any capacity. However, Harvey’s reign would have a year break in play in preparation for a reformatted league in which Arsenal were named as founder members of the FA Women’s Super League, which began in the spring of 2011. And is now formally known as the WSL.',\n",
       "  'Arsenal won the inaugural season, marking their eighth consecutive English title, and secured another domestic double by also winning the FA Cup. After a two-year period without a league triumph though, Harvey would finish her Arsenal tenure having led the team to three consecutive league titles, two Continental Cups and one FA Women’s Cup, not bad for a first time female manager at the helm of what would be a very very big club in years to come, if it wasn’t already..',\n",
       "  'However, as we know once one person leaves another has to come in and in would come another female, in the form of Shelley Kerr as Harvey’s successor in 2013.',\n",
       "  'Kerr was awarded the UEFA Pro Licence in January 2013 and on 1st February she was said to have been “extremely excited” to be announced as Laura Harvey’s successor as manager of Arsenal Ladies.',\n",
       "  'And she didn’t fail to disappoint, as the club under her management won the FA Women’s Cup twice, once in 2013, and the second time in 2014, two weeks after the men’s team won the 2014 FA Cup, completing a rare FA Cup double for the club.',\n",
       "  'They also won the Continental Cup and finished third in the league during the 2013 season. However, after a poor run of form which saw the club gain only one point from the opening four league matches of the 2014 season, exit the Champions League to minnows Birmingham and suffer a shock loss to Reading in the League Cup, Kerr decided to resign as her magic soon rubbed off only one season later.',\n",
       "  'Kerr’s final game in charge of Arsenal was the 2014 FA Women’s Cup final where they beat Everton 2–0 so all was not lost on this front, as she at least signed off with another trophy under her belt.',\n",
       "  'After Kerr’s departure Arsenal were on the lookout for another manager, and with the lack of female managers out there to choose from it would be yet another male figure who would come in and take the reins.',\n",
       "  'And so, in 2014, Pedro Martínez Losa was named as the new manager of Arsenal Women, succeeding Shelley Kerr.',\n",
       "  'Losa came in with a wealth of experience having managed two female teams in Spain from 2008-2012 in the shapes of Pozuelo Alarcon Women and Rayo Vallecano Women. He then left his post at Rayo and moved to the USA where he would be assistant coach to Aaran Lines at Western New York Flash. During his time there he was also handed the role of Advanced Training Instructor at the Flash Youth Academy.',\n",
       "  'While still a part of the Flash set up, Losa also spent the 2013 season as assistant coach to Niagara Purple Eagles women’s soccer coach Peter Veltri.',\n",
       "  'So, it is no wander with his previous experience that Arsenal were quick out the blocks to snap him up and bring him to England.',\n",
       "  'With Arsenal as his next challenge, Pedro also didn’t disappoint, and led the team to the 2015 FA WSL Cup final and the 2016 FA Women’s Cup, lifting both first time around.',\n",
       "  'He also helped lay even more of the foundations for the team’s current success by signing the likes of Dominique Janssen, Sari van Veenendaal, Daniëlle van de Donk, Katie McCabe, Kim Little, Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema. The last four, whom are still at the club and have all made bigger names for themselves by becoming nothing short of legends at Arsenal.',\n",
       "  'In July 2017, the club rebranded as Arsenal Women Football Club, in a move described by Arsenal as a “clear signal of togetherness and unity” to also help retain the progressive ethos of the club, utilised the core Losa helped build.',\n",
       "  'Losa’s time in charge also included bringing through youngsters with the quality of Leah Williamson, Charlie Devlin and Lauren James, and of course we all know Williamson is also another legend at the club.',\n",
       "  'All good things have to come to an end at some point though and Losa left Arsenal in October 2017, following a mixed start to that season.',\n",
       "  'But in would come another male in the form of Australian Joe Montemurro who had left current club at the time Melbourne City to join the Gunners.',\n",
       "  'On 14th March 2018 Montemurro won his first major trophy with Arsenal by beating Manchester City 1–0 to win the FA Women’s League Cup and two months later on 15th May, he led Arsenal to the Women’s FA Cup final in front of a record attendance of 45,423 at Wembley Stadium, but unfortunately, they lost 3–1 to Chelsea.',\n",
       "  'In the 2018–19 season, Arsenal under Montemurro, became the first FA WSL team to win nine games in a row, scoring a whopping 42 goals and conceding just five.',\n",
       "  'But again, the good times had to come to an end and with that so did the winning streak when an injury-stricken squad lost away to Manchester City.',\n",
       "  'Since his appointment though, it was clear to see that the attacking style and fluidity of possession instilled by Montemurro became noticed by all as he had won many accolades.',\n",
       "  'In February 2019 Montemurro became the first coach from the WSL to be nominated for Manager of the Year at the London Football Awards, alongside Maurizio Sarri and Mauricio Pochettino.',\n",
       "  'On 28th April 2019 in front of a record WSL crowd against Brighton & Hove Albion at the Falmer Stadium, goals from Vivianne Miedema, Katie McCabe, Beth Mead and Daniëlle van de Donk, secured the WSL title with games to spare.',\n",
       "  'This would be Arsenal’s first title since 2012. And as if that wasn’t enough, the season was also capped off with Montemurro winning the WSL League Managers Association (LMA) Coach of the Year and deservedly so, as he led the Gunners to their first WSL title in seven years.',\n",
       "  'The accolade nominations for Joe wouldn’t end their though as in July 2019, he was nominated as FIFA World Women’s Coach of the year and nominations for any manager regardless of what team they manage, is a big thing.',\n",
       "  'Arsenal pretty much picked up where they left off in the 2019–20 season as they qualified for the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League and the team was also part of another record-breaking WSL attendance, when 38,200 spectators came to watch the first ever North London Derby at Tottenham’s Stadium in November 2019 in which Arsenal won the match 2–0. NORTH LONDON IS ALWAYS RED!!!',\n",
       "  'Yet another record was broken one month later, when the women beat Bristol 11–1 at Meadow Park, the highest winning margin in the WSL.',\n",
       "  'That would be the end of the records and the accolades though as in March 2021, it was announced that Joe was to leave the club at the end of the season. Although he had the full support of the Arsenal board, Montemurro decided to leave the club in order to take a break and spend more time with his family, however it would be revealed not long after, that he was to go to Italy to become head coach of the Juventus women.',\n",
       "  'Joe left the club in a good place, as he saw them qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Women’s Champions League, with a couple of trophies in the cabinet for his troubles, but he managed to get them back where they longed to be.',\n",
       "  'Three months after Montemurro’ s departure, in the midst of a worldwide pandemic as well, the club appointed current manager Jonas Eidevall, and in June 2021 he was confirmed as head coach for the club. He is yet to win a trophy at the helm however this season especially, it is clear to see the work rate of the team and the improvements he has made with his coaching.',\n",
       "  'Under Eidevall the women have broken some records already. All this season when they smashed the WSL attendance record during the NLD at the Emirates after 47,367 watched Arsenal beat Tottenham yet again, with a 4-0 score line. They also broke the record for accumulating 10 clean sheets in a row and 14 straight wins in a row before losing, unluckily may I add, 3-2 to Manchester United at the Emirates.',\n",
       "  'Arsenal have also spent well in recent transfer windows, bringing in the likes of Stina Blackstenius and Rafaelle Souza to name a few. Even more so under Eidevall’s tenure, Beth Mead has become a world class player, to those who knew her before she was always one, but over the last two seasons she has become a legend to many an Arsenal fan, also lifting the Women’s Euros title after England’s win over Germany in the summer of 2022. And with the club playing as well as they are this season, surely it will only be a matter of time before they lift the WSL trophy again. We hope…',\n",
       "  'Although I have given a history of the managers of the club and the honours they have won, and as we know Arsenal women have had more than their fair share of managers over the years all with mixed results, there was only ever one legend of a manager for the women’s side to date, that of Vic Akers.',\n",
       "  'In 2018 ex Arsenal manager and legend, Monsieur Arsène Wenger said of Vic Akers: “It is absolutely unbelievable what he did. Unfortunately, he did it at a time where women’s football was not popular or rated so much. I am convinced he is a real football connoisseur, who has the instinct of managing, and I think with time he will get the recognition he deserves. The women’s game would be nowhere near where it is today if it was not for him.”',\n",
       "  'And that comes from one legend to another and I couldn’t have put it better myself.',\n",
       "  'Arsenal are statistically the most successful club in English women’s football, holding the records for most titles won in each domestic competition they have played in.',\n",
       "  'The club has won 15 league titles, 14 Women’s FA Cups, five Women’s League Cups, 10 Women’s National League Cups, five Women’s FA Community Shields, and are the only English club to win the UEFA Women’s Champions League to date.',\n",
       "  'They are also the only English club to win the continental treble while going undefeated in all competitions played that same season and in addition to that, in the 2006–07 season, the club became the first in the history of women’s football to achieve the continental European sextuple.',\n",
       "  'So, it is with a big thanks to Vic Akers who became the club’s first, longest-serving, and most successful manager that the women’s team had that the club is where it is.',\n",
       "  'He made the club what it is today and not just that, he put women’s football on the map and although it is a shame it took so long for it to be recognised and although there is a lot more work that needs to be done to get it to the level of the men, me as a football fan in general, and Vic too no doubt, will be and can be proud to see the beautiful game for both the men and the women, be where it is now.',\n",
       "  'Women’s football is more recognised and, in some aspects, more respected than it ever used to be and even though there is a lot more work to be done as I have said, none of this would have happened and neither Arsenal women nor women’s football would have been as successful as it is now if Vic didn’t dedicate everything he had to the cause of building something special.',\n",
       "  'And so, for that, Mr Akers, we will be forever grateful for what you created and what you have left behind, and here is to many more years of success and even more recognition for the women’s game, and for Arsenal women in particular!',\n",
       "  'Heres hoping hey Gooners!',\n",

       "  'Arsenal went top of the league with a 4-0 win against Leicester before the international break, and are ahead of Chelsea on goal difference, with Chelsea having played a game more. But matches after international breaks have tended to be tricky for Jonas Eidevall’s side, with players coming back from all over the world, as well as different playing styles. After the last international break, Arsenal squeaked out a 1-0 win against Reading, who are second bottom, and Arsenal lost at home to Chelsea in the Women’s FA Cup semi-final last season following an international break.

With Mary Earps, Ella Toone and Alessia Russo now European champions, along with Nikita Parris, who joined of course from Arsenal, United have plenty of big game experience. ',\n",

United, who scored twice against Arsenal last season with set pieces that found Alessa Russo’s head, are strong on crosses and set pieces. United have had more possession in all of their matches so far this season, which could be something Arsenal look to expose on Saturday: are United a good defensive side, or were they just a good defensive side against teams worse than them?

Stina has scored 4 goals in 402 minutes, averaging nearly a goal a game, with strong underlying data. Blackstenius constantly runs at defences, looking to exploit space in behind.

       "  'Following Arsenal’s first defeat of the Women’s Super League season at the hands of Manchester United last night, boss Jonas Eidevall still found plenty to praise in our Gunners performance, as he talked to the press after the defeat.',\n",
       "  'I was proud of the way that we turned the game around, Eidevall said after the match. I told them at half-time that I didn’t recognise us as a team out there in the first half, either in defence or in offence. \\xa0I think we managed to turn the game around and we scored the two goals as a result of that.',\n",
       "  'Everything changes when you concede those two goals from the set pieces. But it doesn’t take away from the players that they managed to turn it around. \\xa0We have to look at how we can improve the defending on the set pieces, of course. \\xa0But the effort the players had on the pitch, the bravery that they had to change some things for the second half, that was brilliant. That gives me a lot of confidence that we are on the right track despite the result today.',\n",
       "  'Eidevall noted that the game had highlighted specific areas of improvement',\n",
       "  'In defence, we were not compact enough. We had too much space between our different units. \\xa0So it looked like we were constantly one second too late. \\xa0And what you would typically relate this to is effort, because you think “can’t that player be closer?”. It’s actually our starting positions and us needing to be more compact.',\n",
       "  'It’s a similar problem in our offence – we became too disconnected. We thought one step ahead too soon and we started positioning too high up on the pitch. And that meant that we had to play the ball in to overcrowded spaces, and it was too compact around where we play the ball.',\n",
       "  'So by changing our positioning to be closer around the ball, we actually open up spaces, and it’s easier for us now to change the point of attack and build up or to get in either in front or behind their defending lines. \\xa0So it’s very basic things that we changed at half time. But a lot of times that is the case in football.',\n",
       "  'Despite our eventual defeat, the incredible home support at Emirates Stadium had a noticeable impact on our team’s momentum shift in the second half.',\n",

       "  'So please come back. Please come back next time again, and we go again together. \\xa0And that’s what defines us both as a team, but also as a club. \\xa0It’s our willingness to go forward. We are The Arsenal and we never give up.',\n",

We played very well in that game when we won at home at Boreham Wood in the spring but, before that game, they were a really strong team and were really close to getting points at Chelsea. It went to the last minutes of that game before it was decided. We have massive respect for Aston Villa.

We know that they will be motivated, they will be ready for Sunday and we need to match that.',\n",

       "  \"Currently second in the Women's Super League, Manchester United have only surrendered three points this season and finally look settled under manager, Marc Skinner, who took over last season. But despite their standing, things haven't been handed to them on a platter and have been earned in 90-minute increments.\",\n",
       "  \"After all, this is a team that for years languished under the poor support of leaders who seemingly forgot Man United had a women's team at all. That is changing, but even so, there are still on-field problems that haven't been eradicated from last season and beyond. And yet, Man United keep finding a way to get results nonetheless -- so, just how far can they take it?\",\n",
       "  \"Given where they are now, what are United's chances of a coveted top-three finish on the table, or even securing a first Super League title?\",\n",
       "  'Just three short matches ago, Manchester United were having their weaknesses exposed by reigning WSL champions, Chelsea. Against a team built with world class players, the Red Devils seemingly had neither the experience nor that last few percent that takes a team from very good to world beaters.',\n",
       "  \"Yet when the team from the red side of Manchester travelled to London for their next league outing two weeks later, they looked a side renewed and refocused against the Gunners. Indeed, Man United appeared unwilling to let themselves be overrun by the crushing experience of an Arsenal team that won a first domestic title 26 years before United founded the full-time in-house women's team that plays today.\",\n",
       "  '- World Cup 2022: News and features | Schedule \\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga and more (US)',\n",
       "  \"United have been far from faultless this season, and the vulnerability of previous campaigns remains. They've shown similar errors to ones made in their three previous seasons in the WSL -- the mistakes that took them from possible title contenders to participation trophy winners, unable to finish higher than fourth.\",\n",
       "  'Yet after their loss to Chelsea, when it looked like they were about to spend another season toiling only to finish just shy of the Champions League placings reserved for the top-three finishers on the table, the Red Devils stepped up and put in a commanding first half performance against an Arsenal team not at their best.',\n",
       "  'The criticism of United at the Emirates was their lack of clinical finish that could have easily seen all three points slip from their grasp. Indeed, from a winning position, United then found themselves chasing late in the game, only to score two late goals -- one in stoppage time -- and shock the team who had been leading the league.',\n",
       "  'Again, finding themselves with two weeks between games, United showed their best when they finally returned to action against Aston Villa at Old Trafford on Saturday. The performance an utterly dominant one, it only improved after half-time tweaks that kept Villa further from the ball, allowing United to settle in a relaxed pattern of pulling and pushing the Villainesses across the turf to carve out goal-scoring opportunities.',\n",
       "  \"The result was Man United's most comprehensive win yet of this WSL campaign, a 5-0 thrashing over Aston Villa with goals from five different players. Skinner admitted he wasn't expecting so many of his players to have opened their account for the season so early -- although we are reaching the half-way point of the campaign.\",\n",
       "  \"In fact, ten of the 13 players who've started for Man United in league play this season have found the back of the net at least once with the only exceptions, goalkeeper Mary Earps, defender Maria Thorisdottir and midfielder Lucy Staniforth. Factoring in goals off of the bench, a total of 12 United players of the 19 who've featured in the WSL have scored so far this season, which, even now, is a clear improvement on last season.\",\n",
       "  'As Skinner said on Saturday: \"It\\'s about moving the opponent, last season we faced too many blocks and they [United] just sat in front of them and they couldn\\'t find ways of overcoming that block but now we can play direct if we need to, we can get behind you...\"',\n",
       "  'The manager also cited the six draws his team were involved in over the previous campaign, conceding that people might have been sat wondering just where the goals were going to come from in this go-round. But this season, he said, it\\'s not just about being able to rely on more players to contribute goals but about the different ways his team can manipulate the teams they face. He pointed to United\\'s third goal against Villa as the quintessential display of what has changed -- \"the movement, the play, the composure, the manipulation of the opponent: that\\'s what we want as a group,\" he said.',\n",
       "  \"For United, it's not just on the pitch that things are looking up but off of it too. Following more than a light rumble about conditions not being up to muster during former manager Casey Stoney's time, that factored into the former England captain's decision to leave. The appointment in October of Polly Bancroft as the club's first head of women's football highlights not just the positive steps United are taking to improve things for their women's team, but also shines a light on their previous failings for the club to get to this point without such a role despite it being an FA requirement.\",\n",
       "  \"With things looking so grim at United that players were even considering going on strike just a year and a half ago, it's again critical to contextualise just how far the team have come in a short space of time under Skinner, with the former Orlando Pride and Birmingham City coach taking the reigns after Stoney's departure, ahead of the 2021-22 season. Further still, it's paramount to remember that this incarnation of United Women has only existed for 4 ½ years.\",\n",
       "  \"The sentiment after their defeat to Chelsea was that the Red Devils need time -- time to grow to make the mistakes that they'll learn from to keep improving both on and off the pitch. Things don't come to you overnight in football, regardless of gender, but already we can see just how the pieces are falling into place with this team under Skinner. Even though we're just talking about a change of manager, Stoney had been the one to build the squad from scratch ahead of the 2018-19 season, she had worked to grow that team organically and let them learn from their strengths as the only full-time team in the Championship.\",\n",
       "  \"Coach, manager, analyst and everything in between during that first season, the team were very much Casey Stoney's Manchester United rather than just Manchester United. So, when she departed to start from the ground up with San Diego Wave in the American NWSL, United were losing not just a coach or manager but a key part of their own foundation as a team.\",\n",
       "  \"Although Skinner has greater resources to call upon and a stronger support staff, he's found himself in a pair of gargantuan boots that Stoney left behind. Yet, as has been seen in the league so far this season, he is indeed filling them out and finding the best way for his Manchester United to be and play.\",\n",
       "  'After their narrow win over a defensively stubborn Leicester City team, Skinner said, \"We\\'re not always going to perform brilliantly\" -- the message was intended for the fans who expect a certain degree from a team that bares the United crest. And indeed, it\\'s fair to have lofty standards but no team is impervious to ugly wins, to the wheezing, crawling-over-the-finish-line matches of attrition -- not least for a team who are, on paper, nowhere near as stacked as the three teams who\\'ve finished above them in each of the last three seasons.',\n",
       "  'Yet when you bring their last two matches into view, there is great promise in the team but there is no worry of arrogance from the team who currently sit second in the WSL table, three points adrift of leaders Chelsea, albeit with a game in hand. When asked by ESPN about not getting ahead of themselves, Skinner had this to say:',\n",
       "  '\"First and foremost, it helps if you\\'ve got good people because they\\'re very honest but secondly it\\'s like... you\\'ve done nothing, no disrespect but we\\'ve done nothing. We have to earn everything: that\\'s my character, I think your character as a coach, you impart that onto your team.

So, there is not the worry that the players will lose their grounding despite the increased interest since the Euros or their own standing in the table.',\n",
       "  'In his previous employment with the Pride, the players instantly came out to praise their coach with US veteran defender Ali Krieger even going as far as to say, \"Marc is the best coach I\\'ve had in my career and I have that feeling that I want to win for not only us and myself and the team, but for him and the coaching staff.\"',\n",

Yet he is again clearly well-liked among the players and he understands, as he did in his last spell in the WSL at Birmingham City, how to get the best from the players he has at his disposal. The biggest gripe that, much like England boss, Sarina Wiegman, Skinner has a preferred starting XI and those on the fringes look doomed to warm the bench.',\n",
       "  \"We have, however, seen the manager rotate his squad for league cup games: the area United have struggled the most this season, posting two draws that became shootout losses from their two fixtures so far this season. Although it's no surprise that players who've been without substantial minutes would be coming into their cup starts cold and unable to rely on undeveloped partnerships.\",\n",
       "  'Yet if United are to push into the top three in England and take their first fledgling steps in the Champions League next season, rotation and thoughtful player management will be key in not falling out of step with their league as well as European commitments. Although that is a conversation for another time.',\n",
       "  'For now, United look to be going from strength to strength, having finally found their footing under Skinner. However, with rotation likely for their league cup clash with Everton tomorrow ahead of a stern test at the Etihad against noisy City neighbours, the coach will have to find the right balance, not least facing a Manchester City team full of confidence on an eight-match winning run.',\n",

       "  \"LONDON -- WSL league leaders Arsenal saw their 14-match winning streak come to an end at home to Manchester United after a pair of late strikes from the visitors. In flying form coming into the match, Arsenal failed to find their better football and went in at the break a goal down thanks to Ella Toone's late first half effort.\",\n",
       "  '- Report: Arsenal 2-3 Manchester United | WSL table | Upcoming fixtures',\n",
       "  \"Not on the back foot for long, the hosts equalised early in the second half thanks to Frida Maanum's deflected drive before Laura Wienroither gave them the lead. Lively throughout the match, Untied refused to be beaten and found their own equaliser through Millie Turner at a late free-kick before Alessia Russo completed the breathless turnaround with her own header at set piece in the dying seconds of regular time.\",\n",

       "  \"1. United expose Arsenal's weaknesses\",\n",
       "  'Still playing with an improvised backline following injuries to starting centre-back pair, Leah Williamson and Rafaelle, the Gunners had done well to weather most incoming attacking storms before this outing. Yet, once Leah Galton who has been digging down into some of her better form this season began to run at the usually unchallenged defensive line, the entire Arsenal team began to quake.',\n",
       "  '- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)',\n",
       "  \"Indeed, it was the visitors who enjoyed the better attacking spells during the first half as they stretched the play across the broad Emirates pitch that Jonas Eidevall's team usually relish playing on and had yet to be beaten on in the WSL, winning all four of their previous league matches played in N7.\",\n",
       "  'Even when Arsenal found their equaliser at the start of the second half to swing the match into their favour and help them build momentum, the fragility of their defence remained clear when United questioned its resolution. And with Manuela Zinsberger having a less than faultless day in goal, United trusted in themselves to keep going and indeed, find the moments of quality to see them come away with all three points.',\n",
       "  \"2. Arsenal's stuttering style\",\n",
       "  'Coming into the tie on a 14-match winning run in the league -- a running WSL record -- the Gunners have looked like a team on a mission, with a razor-focus on all the silverware ahead of them. With the 2021-22 season bringing about a dearth of silverware -- a rarity for one of the most successful clubs in the country -- the runners up from last year have been attacking all matches with a belligerent ferocity, pressing their opposition hard and high, scoring for fun along the way.',\n",
       "  \"Yet against Manchester United, that fluency between players was lacking, rapidly dissolving like a puddle on a hot day, leaving only the stain of a memory in its place. It was true that the 11 who started against United weren't necessarily the 11 who Eidevall would have picked out of choice, but rather were the best available to him based on form and fitness. So, it could be argued that the lack of week in week out familiarity in games was lacking yet, the team was the same that had started their last league game before the international break.\",\n",
       "  \"Arsenal, as a team however, understand the way their manager wants them to play, nuances and tweaks for individual games aside, there is a clear and punishing style that the Swede preaches. However, without a player like Kim Little on the pitch to be able to get in and weight the midfield battle in the favour of the Gunners, the system begins to degrade and fail across the pitch. The absence of the Scot in such close games asks everyone on the pitch to find a better first touch, and get comfortable moving the ball at pace without losing the accuracy that is vital. Even with Maanum's goal acting as an accelerant to light the fire under the hosts and force a higher tempo, it was the accuracy and comfort with the ball that was still wanting from Arsenal.\",\n",
       "  '3. United find a 90-minute performance',\n",
       "  \"In their last match before the international break, United battled hard but ultimately came up short against current champions, Chelsea. It was a match riddled with mistakes from both but the difference on the night was Chelsea's ability to go to their bench and find the players to make the difference, to encourage those on the pitch to punish the mistakes when they happened, something the Red Devils could not do.\",\n",
       "  'In London, United fired out of the blocks and instead of playing a balanced match as they did against Chelsea, took the fight to the hosts. It was a bold strategy but one that paid dividends as they found the weaknesses in the Arsenal midfield and defence to exploit.',\n",
       "  \"At 0-1 and 2-1, the complaint from United was easily that they didn't make the most of their first half chances. It looked as if they were going to leave with nothing after deserving something but it was being able to dig deep, to hold themselves firm in the face of Arsenal's attack and cut forward with enough power to keep creating that was the difference for them today.\",\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  \"Again for Man United, it was Katie Zelem's critical dead-ball delivery that propelled them to victory with both second half goals coming from her crosses into the box, but they wouldn't have been a positivity if not for her teammates driving forward and working the defence and goalkeeper. Against Chelsea, it looked as if the gap was indeed closing but only minutely, and that United were still a long way from being able to mix it with the top two in England but at the Emirates, the Red Devils reached out and grabbed their opposition, dragging themselves up to their level, slamming the gap shut. Even if it is only for one match whilst Arsenal don't have all their favoured starters to call upon, it's a reminder that United are there, in touching distance and on a good day, they can compete with anyone.\",\n",

       "  'Neve Herron went in for a 50:50 with Demi Stokes just to the right of the Sunderland box. Both former Gateshead College players were fully committed, eyes only for the ball, and it was the youngster in red and white who came away with the ball. ',\n",
       "  'It felt symbolic, like the passing of a torch between generations.',\n",

       "  'She was nominally playing on the right of three central defenders but was everywhere - popping out of defence to break up play, clearing loose balls in the box, dashing down the wing to create counter attacks, crunching through multiple players in the last few minutes to ensure the scoreline remained respectable.',\n",
       "  'There were fleeting movements and moments in this game where we looked very much their equals. Had Brianna Westrup hit the net with her first half header from a corner, it could have been a very different game.',\n",

       "  'Physically imposing but with a deftness of touch and an intelligent positional sense, the Jamaican centre forward was quite literally head and shoulders above anyone else on the pitch. When she latched onto Steph Houghton’s beautifully weighted through ball to make it three nil, all I could do was applaud. If you don’t appreciate that kind of quality, football’s not the game for you.',\n",
       "  'Sunderland’s forwards - Gears, Dodds and Manders - never stopped running, and the same goes for their replacements Grace Ede and Abby Holmes, but had a hard time getting any change from Alex Greenwood and Houghton and there were moments when our propensity to be careless in possession meant decent opportunities to break went to waste. ',\n",
       "  'As hard working a defensive display as this was from the Lasses, City hardly broke sweat for large portions of the game. The gulf between a side crammed with internationals and a group of women who will be back in work in their other jobs tomorrow morning was always there, only compensated for by the pure graft and organisation that Mel Reay and Steph Libbey have trained into their team.',\n",

       "  'Being situated in the heart of the East Manchester community, it there seemed to be a genuine connection between the players and the supporters. The 2,500 fans there were pretty noisy, and this was encouraged through the distribution of those god awful clackers. The chanting and singing, some very creative - “She’s big, she’s blue, she’ll eat a Kangaroo, Jill Scott, Jill Scott” - others were inexplicably North American (honestly, I didn’t think that “I believe that we will win” would ever migrate across the Atlantic, but each to their own), was really good to hear. ',\n",
       "  'The lack of an away end meant we had to sit amongst it and endure the wondering looks and tutting disapproval of those around us, which sometimes seemed to suggest they couldn’t comprehend why anyone would support a team that wasn’t guaranteed to win 80 per cent of their matches. ',\n",
       "  'What was also nice to see was the smattering of red and white throughout the stands - we saw a little girl with a Sunderland flag was there with her parents, I presume a family of exiles taking their kid to support their side. This is great, and one advantage of these Conti Cup ties is that a game against one of the big Manchester or Merseyside clubs is almost guaranteed every year. I hope it was a special and formative game for her despite the scoreline. ',\n",
       "  'For someone with a long memory, however, there was more than a tinge of jealously wrapped up in this away day. Until they won the ownership lottery in 2008, becoming the pioneering state-run club in English football, there was little to separate us in men’s or women’s football.',\n",
       "  'Even in 2010, they didn’t apply for the inaugural Women’s Super League - neither did we. But Man City have been an ever present in the WSL since 2012, when they joined the top flight despite Sunderland topping Tier 2. It was the money from the UAE that was decisive then, but you cannot question their commitment ever since. ',\n",

       "  'When Sunderland have both of our men’s and women’s teams in the top tier of English football, you know all is right with the world.',\n",
       "  'In November 2009, the Lads were having a very decent season indeed, and after a 1-0 win over Arsenal at the Stadium of Light, Steve Bruce’s side sat eighth in the Premier League. ',\n",
       "  'Darren Bent had grabbed the goal, supported in a hard-working midfield by the likes of Steed Malbranque, Kieran Richardson, and Lorik Cana.',\n",
       "  'We also had a young Jordan Henderson in the men’s side, and there was also another future England international named Jordan - Jordan Nobbs - who was making waves on the Lasses side of the club too.',\n",
       "  'Having gone all the way to the FA Cup Final that spring and given Arsenal - the dominant side of the time who had only lost once in six years - a hell of a fright in a 2-1 defeat, we had been promoted to the Women’s National Premier League 1, the top tier, and Sunderland Women looked set to become a real established force. ',\n",
       "  'The season had gotten off to a good start, with our only league defeats coming against Forest, Jill Scott’s Everton, and the Chelsea side we’d vanquished at the Stadium of Light in the Semi Final of the cup. ',\n",
       "  'And so the week before, Sunderland Women had travelled south to play the Gunners and come away with a goal - but we conceded five in return. Historically, this would have been seen as a pretty decent result, given the gulf in resources between the two set-ups.',\n",
       "  'But at Eppleton that day, with Arsene Wenger’s side having been sent back down the A1 with their tails between their legs, Mick Mulhern’s women managed what had for many years seemed almost impossible, and grabbed all three points. ',\n",
       "  'The Sunderland starting lineup included Nobbs, Demi Stokes, Lucy Staniforth, Kelly McDougall, Rachel Laws, and Abby Holmes. Arsenal’s side read like a roll-call of the greatest names in the history of the game - Katie Chapman, Jayne Ludlow, Rachel Yankie, Gilly Flaherty... it was some team. ',\n",
       "  'We managed to get to 0-0 at half-time, but then the legendary Scottish forward Kim Little scored her 23rd goal of the season, latching onto a Julie Fleeting pass to round Laws and score. ',\n",
       "  'Four minutes later, however, Sunderland were level through Stockton’s finest export, Nobbs, with Sophie Williams getting the assist. It set up a barn-storming finish to the game, with both sides pressing for the winner. ',\n",
       "  'And it was Nobbs who was decisive, crossing for Scoucer McDougall to score the winner with only a few minutes left on the clock. It was a monumental moment, a stand-out result in our club’s history, and to that point the greatest victory this young side had achieved.',\n",
       "  'With two wins against the Londoners in two days, it was a brilliant weekend. Reflecting on the result in an interview with Roker Report - The Lasses Podcast earlier this year, defender Gemma Wilson, told the story of that season and this result in particular. ',\n",
       "  'I think that was their only defeat that year in the league, and only the second time they lost domestically in six years - they had an amazing, amazing side.',\n",
       "  'Them coming up here and us looking for a result, looking to come out with three points, it was a massive change in mentality and culture within the club. ',\n",
       "  'We knew and we trusted who was in front of us, who was behind us, who was alongside us. You knew that if you made a mistake, you had two or three players who were there to pick it up, and we had that core through the spine of the team with experience, then we had the youth and the flare around us as well, and it was just an amazing, amazing year. ',\n",
       "  'We followed up this great victory with a 2-0 win over Chelsea, who we’d vanquished in the FA Cup Semi-Final at the Stadium of Light. We finished the season in fifth, winning 12 of the 24 league games we played. ',\n",
       "  'But the club’s lack of wholehearted support for the Lasses, not for the last time, would stand in the way of their continued progress. The club’s application to join the new and exclusive Women’s Super League was unsuccessful, and a generation of players moved on to bigger and better things. ',\n",
       "  'Nobbs had made her mark on Arsenal, not only in this game and the FA Cup Final, and Wilson knew that she would go on to be a superstar. ',\n",
       "  'If you asked me one player who I knew would make it, it was Jordan. There are some aspects of the game that you can train into people but there are some aspects of the game that are just within certain players, and that ability to read the game and that football intelligence is something that the likes of Jordan, Lucy [Bronze] and Lucy Stan[isforth], they had that already built in them, it was then just about making sure that they met the potential that was already there.  ',\n",
       "  'It took us another four years to get into the WSL, only for that dream to be ruined by yet another abandonment. Yet the dream of top having two-flight sides at Sunderland AFC is still there, it should be the driving ambition of the whole operation - it is rightly the expectation of many Lasses fans.',\n",

       "  'The Reading players will be, quite rightly, aggrieved by the officiating after a fantastic second-half comeback saw them leave Kings Meadow empty-handed and on the wrong end of a 3-2 score line on Sunday night.',\n",
       "  'Kelly Chambers had already voiced her concerns over the standard of refereeing in the WSL this season and this match will only endorse and enforce her opinion after conceding an opening goal from a quickly taken Chelsea free-kick that should have been flagged for offside.',\n",
       "  'Deanna Cooper was adjudged to have given away a foul on the far corner of the Reading penalty area. As Cooper hobbled away, Chelsea quickly took the free kick; the pass to Johanna Rytting Kaneryd - although offside - was squared to Fran Kirby to put the Blues into an early lead after 15 minutes.',\n",
       "  'The Reading bench, with access to the replays, were visibly disappointed and felt let down again by the officials. Phil Cousins, the Royals’ head coach, picked up a yellow card on 20 minutes when his frustration understandably boiled over.',\n",
       "  'It was a shame and real blow for the Royals who started the first quarter of the match well and were equal to the league leaders. Emma Harries kept the captain’s armband throughout the night and put in a super performance. She forced the first Royals corner of the match, on 11 minutes, taking on Magdalena Eriksson down the left wing.',\n",
       "  'From the resultant corner the ball was cleared to Tia Primmer who, after scoring from outside the penalty area against Liverpool, was confident enough to take on another ambitious effort – this time the teenager seeing her attempted lob just too high of the Chelsea crossbar.',\n",
       "  'There were a couple of early scares for the Royals too. Jacqueline Burns was called into action in the first four minutes, her punched clearance fired back in by Chelsea and blocked on the near post by some great recovery defending by Gemma Evans.',\n",
       "  'Reading enjoyed some good attacking down the right-hand side of the pitch. On 24 minutes Sanne Troelsgaard passed to Emma Harries whose right-foot cross was aimed for Lauren Wade at the near post, but was cleared by England international Millie Bright to safety.',\n",
       "  'After some promising play, Reading found themselves 2-0 down just before the half-hour mark. Tia Primmer lost the ball just outside the Reading penalty area, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd’s shot hitting the upright and rebounding back across the penalty area for Jelana Cankovic to react the quickest and side foot into the Reading goal from close range.',\n",
       "  'Within minutes the Royals looked like they may be in trouble when Jelana Cankovic scored her second goal of the evening, nodding home a cross from Erin Cuthbert from the right and put the home side into a commanding 3-0 lead.',\n",
       "  'Apart from a long-range left-foot strike by Justine Vanhaevermaet, after another run and cross from the right by Emma Harries, it was the home side on the ascendancy. The score line remained 3-0 at half-time after some heroic defending and blocks by Gemma Evans and Faye Bryson, and some brave goalkeeping by Jacqueline Burns who needed treatment after a dive and clash with her own team mate.',\n",
       "  'Team: Burns, Bryson, Cooper, Evans, Woodham, Vanhaevermaet, Primmer, Eikeland, Troelsgaard, Wade, Harries',\n",
       "  'After the victory last week against Tottenham Hotspur, Kelly Chambers rewarded the players with an unchanged starting 11 and kept faith with the same team for the start of the second half.',\n",
       "  'Within minutes of the restart Deanna Cooper picked up the Royals’ first playing staff yellow card after sticking out a right leg to stop the Chelsea striker running into the penalty area. Cooper was almost immediately back in the action, this time using her head to deflect a shot from Erin Cuthbert.',\n",
       "  'It was an injury that saw Kelly Chambers make her first substitution of the evening with Rachel Rowe replacing Tia Primmer who hobbled off the pitch.',\n",
       "  'On the hour mark Reading got a lifeline after a cross from Emma Harries, on the right, was cleared by Euros champion Mille Bright, only as far as Sanne Troelsgaard. The Danish international still had a lot to do but managed to side step and get an early shot on goal, past the Chelsea goal keeper, Ann-Katrin Berger, who will have been disappointed to see that go under her body. 3-1.',\n",
       "  'Within 60 seconds it was jubilation as the Royals scored again with a great move and finish down the right-hand side of the pitch. Sanne Troelsgaard’s pass found Rachel Rowe who, in turn, quickly found Emma Harries with her cross perfectly pulled back to Amalie Eikeland who scored Reading’s second goal of the night. 3-2, game on!',\n",
       "  'Faye Bryson picked up a yellow card shortly before being replaced by Reading’s club captain Emma Mukandi - Kelly Chambers presumably looking for experience to try and salvage something out of the match. The third change saw Lauren Wade swapped for Charlie Wellings as the Royals pushed for an equaliser and one that would have been well deserved.',\n",
       "  'Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, can’t have imagined she would have found her team in this position with 15 minutes to go and had to resort to bringing on three substitutes including the formidable Sam Kerr and Guro Reiten.',\n",
       "  'Although there were five minutes of time added on, Chelsea managed to see out the match and, to their relief, finish as 3-2 winners.',\n",
       "  'It was another entertaining game another great comeback attempt by the Royals but, all too similarly, the effort was unrewarded. I’m sure though that Kelly Chambers will have more to say about that.',\n",

Perhaps not a surprise with a kick-off of 6.45pm on a school night, just before Christmas, with sub-zero temperatures and a pitch that resembled a Dickensian Christmas Carol scene (with the assistant referee playing the part of Scrooge…)',\n",

       "  'I was on much stronger ground with this non-physical activity. 30-odd years of watching as much footy as I can fit in added to a bookish childhood spent poring over the copy of the laws of the game found in an FA pocket diary, mean that I like to think that I’m pretty au fait with even the more obscure rules under which the world’s most popular team sport has been built.',\n",
       "  'One of the questions in this quiz related to a famous incident - the beach ball incident against Liverpool at the Stadium of Light. I duly demonstrated my superior knowledge - of course, the goal never should have stood, but oh how we laughed... Sunderland had really had got away with one there! ',\n",
       "  \"We sometimes forget the ref, Mike Jones, was demoted to the Championship as a punishment for the mistake. It was a genuine mistake, a human error, something that shouldn't have happened but something that has gone down in the folklore of Sunderland AFC and the Premier League more generally.

       "  'Then, just before my lad’s Under 13s game against his side’s local rivals this Saturday on a frosty 4G surface in my village, I was summonsed by one of the coaches. My heart sank as he opened his mouth, for I knew what was coming... would I be able to ref the game? ',\n",
       "  'Of course, I agreed. There were 20 boys and girls in their smart new kits, plus countless parents, brothers and sisters on the sidelines who’d dragged themselves out of bed on a cold November morning for this game. ',\n",
       "  'There was no way that my reluctance to run up and down the pitch for 70 minutes, whistleless, cardless, making honest but sketchy calls on offsides, free kicks, and penalties (I gave two penalties - one to each side - both disputed) - decisions that would likely colour the rest of these youngsters’ weekends - was going to be enough to stop me from agreeing. I was absolutely knackered afterwards, you can’t stop and you really have to concentrate. ',\n",
       "  'That there was no actually trained, qualified, and equipped official at the game was hardly a rarity - there will be people reading this who ref their kids’ games regularly and probably do a much better job than I did - but I can say that when there is a proper referee it makes a hell of a difference to the experience for everyone. ',\n",
       "  'They’re able to talk players through the match, ensure everyone is clear about why decisions have been given, and take up the right positions on the field, so they can make decisions -  or at the very least not find themselves in the line of a throw-in. ',\n",
       "  'We also know that there’s a horrible tendency, thankfully one I didn’t have to endure this weekend, for those who do put themselves forward to officiate at youth football and the adult grassroots game to be verbally abused and even physically assaulted for having the temerity to facilitate the application of the rules of the game as they see it. ',\n",
       "  'Indeed, I assume it is more likely for a “proper” neutral ref to face abuse and intimidation, a stand-in parent is less likely to face overly competitive coaches, know-it-all parents or hormonal, immature kids getting in their faces and threatening them than someone wearing a full black kit with the FA badge who brandished a red card to little Jimmy or Jenny for denying a goalscoring opportunity. ',\n",
       "  'What has this got to do with the ever-present concern about the quality of decision-making in the professional game in general and some of the concerns of Sunderland supporters this season in particular? ',\n",
       "  'Well, for a start, the abuse of referees from players and spectators is clearly “learned behaviour”. ',\n",
       "  'It’s obviously cultural, it’s something that is copied and carried down through the tiers and the age groups from the professional ranks. What people see at the top levels - and this goes for adults as well as kids - is copied when they’re in the park or on the school 4G pitch.',\n",
       "  'This is something that happens throughout our game but doesn’t happen in other football codes - particularly in rugby. The question as to why this is the case has been asked many times with a variety of answers, but for me, all roads ultimately lead back to us, the paying fans of professional football clubs watching in the stands or at home on pay TV. ',\n",
       "  'I am part of this culture, at Sunderland men’s and women’s matches or at England internationals I am as likely as anyone reading this to be amongst the thousands vocally disagreeing with the calls I see made by the ref. ',\n",
       "  'But I was brought up with the belief that, over the course of a season, the individual incidents will even themselves out for any given club and that, ultimately, trusting in the impartiality and honesty of referees is really important. It means that the players, coaches, and owners of the club we love have to take ownership of results and that at the end of the season, the table doesn’t lie. ',\n",
       "  'And I rarely leave a game thinking that the reason the Lads or the Lasses haven’t got the result we wanted was because of poor refereeing, even if that obvious penalty for handball that wasn’t given to the women’s side the other week at Blackburn still narks, as does the penalty Jack Clarke didn’t get at Ewood too. ',\n",
       "  'The old maxim that, if you’re relying on an offside call or a spot kick for three points, then you’ve really not done enough to deserve them, still applies for the most part. That’s not to say that there are no major issues with refereeing in English football today. ',\n",
       "  'We’re all very aware of those times when the impartiality of referees has been questioned. It’s not just at the extremes like the Serie A corruption scandals to accusations and suspicions of impropriety at the 2002 World Cup, although it is certainly is still a potential issue when the rewards of taking a bribe are a lot higher than the money on offer.',\n",
       "  'We hear every week in the Premier League claims that the full-time professional referees - the elite - are more likely to side with one of the “Big 6” European Super League scab clubs over their less illustrious challengers. In the EFL Championship, we’ve been on the receiving end of a few well-below-par refereeing decisions this season that, if they had gone the other (the correct) way, would probably have seen us stilling very close to if not inside the playoff places right now. ',\n",
       "  'In the Women’s Championship, we have amateur referees overseeing an increasingly fast-paced, physically demanding, and professional game. These are people - sometimes young women themselves - who have other jobs and commitments and are often travelling long distances to take games for not that much money, and so the mistakes they make need to be set in that context.',\n",
       "  'However, unless there are more referees coming through in grassroots football, which is the lifeblood of our whole game, then the pool of talent from which the elite level officials are drawn will be anaemic. Refs at the top will be left with little competition, with the inability of those who are performing poorly to be replaced with the sharp eyes and minds of the up-and-coming.  ',\n",
       "  'But this begs the question: who would be a ref these days, and how on earth do we bring through future generations of high-ranked officials into the game? ',\n",
       "  'I’ve heard suggestions that the problem is that refereeing attracts officious pernickety characters, those with authoritarian mindsets, the power-hungry or even those with sadomasochistic tendencies. It’s claimed by some that they deserve the dog’s abuse they receive and more, that they’re all “Little Hitlers” who get a kick from ruining matches. My view of the world is not so dark and cynical.',\n",
       "  '99 percent of those who take the field to adjudicate games are doing so simply because they love football, they want to be involved in football, and they know that, without their commitment, football would not exist. ',\n",
       "  \"The sixth-former who turns up on a weekend or after school to take an under 10s game is unlikely to be a megalomanic, they’re simply the kind of community-minded young person that we’d all want our brothers, sisters, children or grandchildren to be. But it's these kids who are being chased away - sometimes literally - by the arseholes shouting from the sidelines up and down this country.\",\n",
       "  'Yes, at the very top level the refereeing teams are paid and they can concentrate on improving and refining all aspects of their performance so that they can keep up with the unbelievable pace and power of the contemporary game, but this time and these resources are only available to a small minority. All those who do make it as pro-referees have come through the ranks while pursuing other careers - jobs that they’ve chosen to leave in order to reach the peak of football officialdom.',\n",
       "  'Yet we all still see the issues, week in week out. Inconsistency in decision-making is the most consistent concern that we hear from fellow fans, closely followed by a worry that the man or woman in the middle are only interested in their own ego or being the centre of attention, or are on the other hand overawed by the big occasion. ',\n",
       "  'Accusations of actual conscious bias are rare, although the suspicion that some clubs get an easier ride than others has and always will be there. ',\n",
       "  'I don’t have many solutions to the problem of quality in the upper ranks. Some sensibly suggest that we need to find ways to get more former footballers to make the move across the divide and take charge of games, they know how the game needs to be controlled and can communicate from a position of empathy and knowledge with their peers. ',\n",
       "  'But on a practical level this becomes difficult - even in the professional game the money on offer is unlikely to be attractive to all but the most altruistic of former footballers - their own misdemeans and rivalries from their playing careers will haunt them wherever they go. ',\n",
       "  'I am ambivalent when it comes to VAR. Personally, I think it has the potential to work, and when applied correctly can lead to the right decisions being made. But it needs to be refined and improved to get more consistency and with speed, because getting the right decision in a sport where the rewards are counted in the hundreds of millions of pounds is very important. ',\n",
       "  'It’s important because, if people don’t believe in the system, if they think its rigged, if they think it’s unfair, then they will become angrier and angrier, and the vicious circle that leads to 16-year-old referees being attacked in park football will continue to whirl out of control.   ',\n",
       "  'There has been a very welcome decline of blind deference in our society over the past few decades. Questioning officialdom, critical thinking, and demanding fairness and evidence rather than tipping your cap to those who’ve been placed in authority is part of the modern democratic world. Unaccountable and entrenched authority, based on nothing more than tradition and seniority, is almost always a bad thing. ',\n",
       "  'But fairness for all, particularly those without so much money and power, also requires clear and consistently applied rules and impartial arbiters. And we should always be open to learning from others and applying these lessons to our own situations. ',\n",
       "  'So maybe we need to mic up with referees in the Premier League, the WSL and the men’s and women’s Championship, so that those watching on the TV and even in the stands know why a decision has been made. ',\n",
       "  'It’s what happens in rugby, where someone of the diminutive stature of Nigel Owens is able to give a thorough dressing down to two 17 stone props and explain the often perplexing laws of that version of football to the thousands in the grounds and millions watching on the telly at the same time. ',\n",
       "  'Perhaps if we’re able to hear the discussions between the referee and the players, and the on-field ref and the VAR or Fourth Official, then we will all learn a lot more about why a particular rule has been applied (or not applied) to a particular scenario, and some of the more egregious abuse that stems from the top and filters to the bottom will be halted. ',\n",
       "  'Almost all controversy has been removed from cricket by the video referral system, and I think football should become open to allowing coaches or captains to request VAR look at a limited number of incidents during a game once the ball is out of play (the awarding of a corner, for example, or a second yellow card, which currently cannot be examined but which could change the course of a game). A reformed VAR, with more input and explanation, could be transformative to modern football’s often toxic culture. ',\n",

       " \"It was my birthday as well and Caitlin Foord, I have her jersey. She wears the No 19 and it was on October 19 and she scored the opening goal. Suddenly, in the game, I thought 'that's it' - not in the way that we should stop, but to keep going [after the first goal].\",\n",
       " \"It's not just Arsenal where Zinsberger shines. She is also No 1 for Austria, where she grew up in a small village 'of around 350 people', she estimates.Actually, the 27-year-old followed in the footsteps of her dad, who also played as a goalkeeper - apologising to him after joking that he was not as good as she is. Like female footballers in the UK, she grew up playing with boys in Austria, and a lack of goalkeeper on her team as a youngster saw her rotate into the position.However, it did not prove to be a popular choice with her parents, although they have of course since become her biggest supporters and cheerleaders.\",\n",
       " ' she recalled.',\n",
       " \"She said 'why are you not joining? Come with me, have a look and if you want to try it out, you can'. When we arrived there, the boys started practising and I was sitting with the mum on the bench and she said 'are you not interested to just try it out' and I wanted to.\",\n",
       " \"I was an outfield player until I was nine and then the goalkeeper had to leave the club because of his parents' job so the coach said 'if no one is in goal, we can't play'. So at the beginning, we just swapped so I went in goal and then I started to like it. I liked the balance between being the hero and being the 'boo man' or 'boo woman'.\",\n",
       " \"There was no grass and I stood up and then did it on the other side. Then he was like 'OK, I'm fine, you can be a goalkeeper'.\",\n",

       " \"It's about my presence on the pitch,\",\n",
       " \"I'm giving the team calmness, I communicate with my defence as much as possible, how do we go on goal kicks, taking responsibility, trying to step up in hard situations in the game, like taking crosses. There, you can show in actions that you are taking responsibility.\",\n",
       " \"I think it's also about my footwork. I'm trying to be active and help them, I'm not trying to hide myself, I'm there like 'you need me, I need you so we have to keep working together', so I think it's a mix of all of them. You need a real presence behind the team so they don't have to look back, they know they have a strong goalkeeper without even looking. That is what I've shown to them in the last few years and the team needs someone they can trust without looking.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\",\n",
       " \"I made a plan for myself of how do I get better as quickly as possible, but still being patient. So I took my boxes and had one for 'football', 'mental health and 'nutrition' and got better and that made me the person I am today.\",\n",
       " \"Other than that, I'm quite satisfied - could have won more titles, but at least I got one, but at the end of the season, I might have another one.\",\n",
       " 'I love the Emirates Stadium. I love it. I really love watching [football] there and also playing on the pitch.',\n",
       " \"The atmosphere is great when it's filled up with fans and having the 12th player on the pitch. I can't wait to play on the pitch again and more often.\",\n",
       " 'They have done great since the beginning of the season,',\n",
       " \"Never underestimate Manchester United, the whole team, it's impressive what they have achieved, how they work against the ball, with the ball.\",\n",
       " \"But I don't want to focus too much on Man United. I'm not going to underestimate them, but it's about us. I can't influence Man United, I can only influence my part in the game, with the team, but also as individuals.\",\n",
       " \"But this is the game you are waiting for and especially having it at Emirates, it makes it such a great environment. It's a great atmosphere, so many fans can come and watch and it's the next step of keeping women's football going. It's a great game on Saturday and everyone should come and watch!\"]"

A terrifically well-worked goal, too, he and Eriksen staying ice-cool under pressure to slickly prise open Fulham’s backline.',\n",
       "  'United win it in the last minute of added-time. Again United attack down the left, this time Eriksen charging forward and playing a one-two-three with Garnacho, who is suddenly through on goal. The Argentinian prods home an calm left-foot finish to decide the game!',\n",
       "  '90 mins: Casemiro pokes the ball into the box, Ream flicks it on and Fernandes meets it at the back to to send a header across the face of goal. It’s begging for an attacker to tap it in, but there’s no one there and Fernandes appears to take that as a personal insult. Cairney is replaced by Onomah.',\n",
       "  '88 mins: Every United attack today seems to have gone through Shaw. This time the left-back lifts an early cross into McTominay on the edge of the box. This time the midfielder gets his header right, but he’s too far out and Leno saves. Fulham break through James, whose low cross from the right is turned behind by Lindelof at full stretch.',\n",
       "  '86 mins: Palhinha, magnificent today, breaks up a promising United attack with a ferocious sliding tackle on Rashford and wins a free-kick for his side to boot. ',\n",
       "  '82 mins: Some very tidy passing out from the back from United before McTominay sells Palhinha a dummy and switches play to Garnacho. He frees Shaw on the overlap and the fullback’s cross picks out McTominay for what would be a glorious team goal … but the midfielder sends a free header wide. Great chance!',\n",
       "  '80 mins: Fulham win a free-kick on the right. Pereira takes and, seeing Palhinha pulling away, gives his teammate a free header – but the Portuguese misjudges and send the ball well over.',\n",
       "  '78 mins: James again escapes down the right, this time electing not to beat Martinez but instead going for the early cross, belted away by the backtracking Lindelof.',\n",
       "  '74 mins: Garnacho picks up the ball on the left and drives dangerously into the box, falling under the challenge of Decordova-Reid. No penalty. A minute later, he does the same thing again, this time without the penalty claim. He’s livened United up.',\n",
       "  '71 mins: James streak down the right leaving Martinez for dead, but doubles back rather than crossing and his eventual ball into the box is cut out. United send on Garnacho for Martial.',\n",
       "  '69 mins: Martial drops deep to gather the ball and looks to pick out Rashford who is haring down the left, but Fulham’s defence shuts the door on him. Casemiro picks up the ball and heaves a long ball back towards Martial, who watches forlornly as it sails over his head.',\n",
       "  '65 mins: Fulham are hungry for a second. A spell of prolonged pressure culminates with Casemiro heading a Robinson cross over his own bar.',\n",
       "  'Don’t say I didn’t warn you. Fulham spring forward when Robinson’s early ball to Willian sets the Brazilian scampering free down the left. He carries, carries, then waits until just the right moment to release to the overlapping Cairney, who low left-foot cross invites the former United man to tap home. He obliges.',\n",
       "  '59 mins: Narrative alert: Daniel James comes on for Harry Wilson.',\n",
       "  '58 mins: Another Fulham attack makes it as far as Vinicius before fizzling out. They relaunch down the right, from where Pereira whips in a great deep cross that Malacia sees out for a corner.',\n",
       "  '55 mins: Change for United – Elanga goes off, McTominay on. ',\n",
       "  '51 mins: Wilson burrows down the right and squeezes in a low cross towards Vinicius at the back post. He spins and batters a left-foot shot but it’s straight at De Gea, who repels it wide. The corner is worked to Cairney, who floats in a cross to Ream at the back stick. The defender meets it powerfully but again De Gea is there is palm the ball over.',\n",
       "  '50 mins: Martial works Leno again with a 20-yard snapshot, but it’s too close to the keeper who gathers easily.',\n",
       "  '48 mins: Fernandes looks to the inside left channel and slips in Elaga, whose early low effort is well saved by Leno. Rashford follows up but his shot can’t get through a wall of defensive bodies.',\n",
       "  '47 mins: Willian feeds Vinicius on the left, and the Brazilian’s low cross is cut out by Lindelof before it can reach Pereira. When the corner comes in, the ball is half-cleared and breaks to Cairney on the edge of the box, but he slices wildly over.',\n",
       "  '46 mins: And we’re back under way. Fulham kick off and attempt a couple of route-one attacks, both curtailed by Lindelof.',\n",

       "  'Half-time reading, from elsewhere in the Premier League:',\n",
       "  'And that’s the last action of a lively half. Fulham have showed lots of attacking ambition without truly creating much. United have picked their moments to strike and could be two up. Get the kettle on.',\n",
       "  '45 mins: Shaw, probably United’s best player this half, marauds forward and is tugged back by Palhinha, who escapes a booking. Then Martinez sweeps the ball forward to Elanga, whose smart backheel finds Fernandes on the corner of the box. He squares for Eriksen who times his arrival perfectly but, from the penalty spot, sends a simple finish the wrong side of the post',\n",
       "  '41 mins: United mount a decent attack, Rashford laying back to Shaw whose clipped first-time cross find Martial, but the striker’s glanced header flashes just over.',\n",
       "  '40 mins: Lindelof, spooked by the Fulham press, passes the ball straight out of play. Fulham work it forward again but the attack breaks down with Vinicius who, not for the first time, fails to hold the ball up.',\n",
       "  '38 mins: Fernandes tries a silly flick in his own half, Fulham pounce and Pereira swings in a nicely shaped cross which is seen out for another corner. United are officially under the cosh.',\n",
       "  '34 mins: Another dangerous Willian cross is headed away by a United centre-half. My kingdom for a Serbian target man. Then Robinson hurtles down the same flank to win a corner – Malacia clearly being targeted here – which is hung up for a blazing volley that Willian shanks high and wide.',\n",
       "  '33 mins: Willian, Fulham’s best attacker so far, wriggles away down the left once again and fires in a cross which Martinez heads clear. As Rashford tears away upfield, Reid is booked for stopping him in his tracks.',\n",
       "  '30 mins: Eriksen picks out Rashford on te left, who nudges the ball infield, where a hole has opened up in Fulham defence. Martial, realising he’s in on goal, gets a shot away which squirms through Leno’s legs, but loses enough pace in doing so for the keeper to scamper back and stop it from crossing the line.',\n",
       "  '29 mins: Wilson tries his luck again, shimmying in from the right and bending one from 20 yards which De Gea beats away two-fisted. Good fun this.',\n",
       "  '26 mins: Pereira spins brilliantly away from Martinez on the edge of the box and slides the ball in behind the United defence for Wilson, whose stretches to divert to goalwards. De Gea saves instinctively before the flag goes up against Wilson – a tight one. ',\n",
       "  '23 mins: The game has settled into a patter of Fulham probing patiently and United looking to spring on the break. Palhinha cuts a United counter short with a terrific tackle on Elanga, who had escaped down the right.',\n",
       "  '20 mins: Willian involved again, this time jinking in from the left and attempting the long-range curler. It flies well wide. United go up the other end of the pitch and Fernandes’s glorious deep cross picks out Rashford alone at the back post. It arrives at at awkward height for Rashford, who fluffs the finish – but was offside.',\n",
       "  '19 mins: Pereira picks up the ball on the edge of the box and lays off to the onrushing Willian. He hits the byline but his pull-back can’t find a white shirt.',\n",
       "  '18 mins: Casemiro tries a shot from his own half. It goes nowhere near the goal. Not the sort of intervention he was bought for.',\n",
       "  'Cairney is caught in possession by Casemiro on halfway and in a flash, Martial charges forward, feeds Fernandes down the inside left and the Portuguese squares across the six-yard box for Eriksen to tap home. Casemiro started that with the sort of unshowy intervention he was bought for.',\n",
       "  '13 mins: Rashford channels Ronaldinho, trying to beat Decordova-Reid with an elastico. It doesn’t quite come off – good fun though.',\n",
       "  '11 mins: Fulham turn the screw. Willian scampers forward but can’t quite feed Vinicius in the box, before Robinson drifts in a back-post cross which Shaw scrambles clear.',\n",
       "  '9 mins: United’s first meaningful attack comes as Shaw bends a ball down the line for Rashford, who advances into the area and lays off to Martial. For a second he has a sight of goal, but tries to dart through two defenders and is crowded out.',\n",
       "  '7 mins: Fulham are looking to attack down their left. After Wilson switches play nicely, Palhinha wrestles Malacia to the ground but his floated cross sails out for a goal kick.',\n",
       "  '5 mins: Eriksen is caught on the ball by Palhinha, kickstarting smart Fulham attack that ends with Vinicius’s low drive forcing a characteristic save-with-the-legs by De Gea.',\n",
       "  '3 mins: Robinson gallops down the left and is felled, fairly, by the earnest Elanga who has tracked back diligently.',\n",
       "  '1 min: Casemiro ends a period of scrappy play by funnelling the ball out to Malacia, who is starting at right-back to offend all our aesthetic sensibilities.',\n",

Roy Hodgson’s Fulham were three days removed from a delirious and snowy 3-2 win away at Basel, confirming our place in the knock-outs of the Europa League. Bobby Zamora and Zoltan Gera were unplayable. It was my birthday.”',\n",
       "  '“What about Van Nistelrooy’s sensational solo goal?” asks Edward Taylor. I mean, it was at Old Trafford so not strictly the same fixture but I’ll give you it nonetheless. Was that the least Van Nistelrooyish goal Van Nistelrooy ever scored? And has a footballer ever run the length of the pitch, leaving defenders trailing in his wake, at such hilariously slow speed?',\n",
       "  'Some highlights – off the top of my head – from this fixture over the years. February 2007: Cristiano Ronaldo scores a ludicrous late solo goal to secure a vital win en route to the title. March 2009: Wayne Rooney punches the corner flag on his way to the tunnel having been sent off in a 2-0 defeat. February 2014: Darren Bent starts hammering the nail into the coffin of the David Moyes era with a 95th-minute equaliser to make it 2-2. Any more for any more?',\n",

What looks good on paper doesn’t always play well in practice, though – especially for United.',\n",
       "  'Marco Silva gives Tom Cairney his first Premier League start of the season, a sign, perhaps, that he intends to get at United with probing possession rather than anything more direct.

We have to be allowed to hear the conversations between officials, as we do in rugby union and cricket. ',\n",
       "  '74 min Another change for Villa, Bailey for Buendia. ',\n",
       "  '73 min I’ve said before that part of the problem with the game is the kind of offence for which a penalty – so a goal roughly 80% of the time – is awarded. It should be given for any offence, anywhere on the pitch, that stops a proper goalscoring opportunity, and for an infringement in the box which does not, a direct free-kick is plenty. But another problem is not being able to hear the deliberations when VAR is involved – for the crowd in the ground, for us at home, and to make sure we understand why things are happening.',\n",

VAR is investigating, but it’s not totally clear whether March got to the ball before Digne … but from the angle we’re looking at now, from behind the defender, March gets a foot on it, then Digne whacks through him! That’s a penalty all day long, apart from on Sunday 13 November. VAR says no! i’ve no idea why! ',\n",
       "  '69 min Yup, Young is now at right-back with Cash shuffling along which makes sense – Brighton have been good down the left. But in the meantime, Gross makes ground down the other flank and clips back, but Caicedo, arriving with decent timing, can’t quite take the ball in stride and Villa clear. ',\n",
       "  '68 min Emery is nothing if not practical and pragmatic; he sends on Young for Ramsey, so might be changing to a back five. ',\n",
       "  '67 min Since going behind, Brighton have had 78% possession. That doesn’t tell us loads – Villa are sitting a little deeper – but the home side are passing it nicely; has anyone ever wondered how good they might get if they had a reliable goalscorer? ',\n",
       "  '66 min Lovely from Brighton, Colwill easing out with the ball and sliding a fine pass inside McGinn for Estupinan, whose cross is sent behind by Mings. That’s good defending, and the corner is then cleared easily enough. ',\n",
       "  '64 min I’ve been really impressed with Villa’s mentality this last week. They started so quickly against Man United then conceded a fluke on the stroke of half-time after which United started to move the ball with tempo. So Villa won it off them, broke in devastating style, and scored a lovely clincher, while today, they’ve ridden the concession of a soul-crushing goal to roar back. ',\n",
       "  '63 min Eeesh, Cash stretches into a tackle with Caicedo, misses the ball, and leaves studs on Caicedo. It’s a right sair yin, but I think he’ll be fine. ',\n",
       "  '60 min I’m sure Ings is pretty happy with life at the moment, but I do wonder how his career might’ve gone had he had better luck with injuries. At his best, he has that rare ability to occupy a defence on his own, and I doubt there’s any centre-back pairing or triumvirate that’d look forward to facing him and Watkins in tandem. I’m sure that’s part of the thinking behind Emery’s 4-2-2-2 formation – the question is balancing the team in that context. Perhaps if Ings drops off he can make an extra man in midfield, because those two with wingers spells goals. ',\n",
       "  '59 min Bunedia is hurt, so while he’s treated Brighton make a double change, Veltman and Undav replacing Welbeck and Enciso, himself on as sub. ',\n",
       "  '57 min Buendia gets away from Caicedo, who crunches him like so many Frosties, as Raymond Chandler didn’t write, and is booked. ',\n",
       "  'Villa maintain pressure and, in a role-reversal of Brighton’s opener, Luiz robs Mac Allister high, the ball squirts out to Ings who sends Dunk off to the beach, twisting away from him as he slides in, then with Sanchez expecting a far-post finish, snaps gently through Colwill’s legs and a deflection takes it inside the near!',\n",
       "  '54 min Anyway, there’s some football going on, and it’s good football! Cash nashes down the right, clips back and Buendia dives into a fine header – think the body-shape of Van Persie v Spain – that clatters the post!',\n",
       "  '52 min Brighton look much more assured playing out from the back, which makes sense – the team has been put together with that in mind, and they’ve been doing it for longer. They work it nicely on this occasion too, the ball ending up with Sanchez again but with space created so that he can punch a pass down the middle ad into Mac Allister. Increasingly, top-level football seems to be about that, forcing opponents into areas to then exploit the space. And no, I’m not saying this is a new invention, rather that it’s a more fundamental part of the game than before. ',\n",
       "  '50 min Trossard shoves Cash rather than contest a high ball, before spinning to thunk a tremendous finish from outside the box, left-hand side, in off the underside of the bar. He’s another who does, I think, have very serious and significant potential. ',\n",
       "  '48 min This time next week, Moises Caicedo will be getting ready to play for Ecuador in the opening game of the World Cup. That is, of course, both odd and wrong, but I really like the look of him, and if looks to have all the ability to develop into an all-round midfielder in both old and new-skool tradition. ',\n",
       "  '47 min It’s a strange thing, given the openness of the game, but we’ve not actually seen that many chances. I wonder if, as the teams tire, we see more of them but less quality, but in the meantime there’s a game going on, March nipping around the side of Villa to cross; Villa get the ball away. ',\n",
       "  '46 min The ball goes back to Martinez, who dwells on it, but under pressure from Trossard, he lashes clear. ',\n",
       "  '46 min We go again!',\n",

United’s win was secured by a fearless young talent but over the course of the game it was less glamorous senior figures who gave United a platform for the win. Luke Shaw put in an industrious shift from left-back, covering the flank on his own and sparking numerous attacks with assured passing and clipped early crosses. Next to him, Victor Lindelöf stood firm when the visitors were firmly under the cosh at 1-1, repelling balls in the air and on the ground with zero margin for error.

His understanding with Andy Robertson down the left and awareness of what those around him expect, encapsulated by a delightful backheel to set up Roberto Firmino following a superb move, also demonstrated how things are falling into place for Núñez at Liverpool. “He has all the qualities for a modern-day striker,” said Virgil van Dijk. “There is a reason why we bought him and he’s maturing, he’s stayed patient, kept his head down, and that’s a credit to him.

He was on song from the start against Jesse Marsch’s team and seemed to get even stronger as the game continued; angst over the availability of Son Heung-min and Harry Kane is nothing new at Spurs but there is a strong argument that Kulusevski should not be considered any less important.

Hosting a tournament is a way of protecting themselves – as is investing in football clubs. I understand that.',\n",

       "  '“The original idea was to get together among the European federations and come up with the best idea,” he says, “but the end product is an armband that possibly means a lot but doesn’t upset anybody. It becomes generic, people go: ‘What does it mean?’ Then they move on. It doesn’t start a debate. We know the rainbow flag symbol upsets people. People know what it stands for – and some in Qatar don’t like it so much. That’s stronger.”',\n",

Besides, this goes beyond sport. “Not long ago the German FA president and the interior minister said they had been reassured by the Qatari interior minister that everybody would be safe. And you think: what world are we living in?! That someone has to give a guarantee!”',\n",
       "  'And the message may also be lost in the noise. “When it’s every day even people who agree think: ‘I can’t hear this any more,’” Hitzlsperger concedes. “I’m trying to find a balance between saying it, refusing to be quiet, and not saying it every day. It’s a shame: it destroys part of the game.”',\n",

In order to buy one of the most famous and profitable football institutions in the world, the Glazers raised £540m worth of debt and then loaded it on to the club itself. Over the past 17 years, against a backdrop of supporter protests and a decline in performance on the pitch, the Glazer ownership has cost the club more than £1.5bn in interest payments, debt and other outgoings. The family have used Manchester United as their private ATM, personally extracting vast sums in dividend payments and “management fees”, and organising soft loans to their other companies. Their ruthlessly exploitative modus operandi has been a sporting scandal in plain sight.',\n",

The scuppering of unpopular plans for a lucrative European Super League, along with the post-Abramovich sale of Chelsea to American buyers for a £4.25bn investment, appears to have convinced the family that now might be the right time to cash out. Earlier this month, the American owners of Liverpool came to the same conclusion, putting another world-famous English institution on the market. According to Forbes, United are worth £3.9bn, but that figure may rise dramatically in a bidding war. Early reports suggest the Glazers may be hoping for £6bn. ',\n",

He glides through his house like a ghost: if he hadn’t shaken my hand and introduced himself, I probably wouldn’t have registered his presence. He floats off to the fridge, takes out slices of white Hovis, makes himself a mustard sandwich, heats up green soup and starts eating. All without a murmur. De Bruyne is a paradox. He is both famously shy and famously outspoken. A number of stories shape the mythology around him. The first is that at eight he turns to his father and says he wants to leave his club, KVV Drongen, because the training sessions at Ghent, another local club, are better. Second, now playing for Ghent, he gets so enraged when told off for not helping to clear up the pitch that he grabs one of the posts and refuses to let go. Three adults try to pull him away but fail, and his coach, Frank De Leyn, has to stay with him because De Bruyne tells him he is planning to hold on all night.',\n",
       "  'Fast forward a few years for another classic tale: De Bruyne is on the verge of the first team at rival Belgian club Genk, living there with a foster family during the week, when they decide, two years in, that they don’t want him to live with them any more because he doesn’t fit in; he’s too quiet. Finally, there is the time, aged just 20, when he gives a half-time interview ripping into his Genk teammates for shirking: “I’m ashamed of them. I suggest that those who don’t have a desire to play just leave,” he says at the time.',\n",
       "  'His management team are also here today and he’s talking to them in a quiet, flat voice. It’s so understated you almost tune out. Then you hear what he’s saying. Asked if Belgium can win the World Cup, he says, “No chance, we’re too old.” It’s only seven months ago that Belgium were ranked No 1 in the world. De Bruyne says that because the tournament is being played in Qatar in mid-season, it doesn’t feel like a real World Cup. One of his reps says it must be a dream playing with Erling Haaland, the extraordinarily prolific striker at City. “Ach, it’s like any forward.” Even he thinks his response is underwhelming. “He is so quick, though,” he adds. ',\n",
       "  'He finishes his soup, cuts up some blackberries and grapes for baby Suri, who is sitting in her highchair having her hair primped for the photoshoot. He says his childhood was so different from that of his children. His father worked in a factory painting trains, his mother was a housewife, and he describes his background as “lower-middle class”. What was he like at school? “I was OK. Smart enough to know how much I needed to do and to finish it. I left at 18 with a diploma.”',\n",
       "  'I ask why so many European footballers seem better educated than their British counterparts. Perhaps the difference is languages, he says. “There are a lot of people from different countries who speak two or three languages, where English players usually only speak English. I come from a country where by 13 you are studying Dutch, French and English.” With languages, perhaps comes wisdom and humility – an ability to put yourself in the shoes of others, a knowledge that your way is not the only way. He smiles. The Belgian way was never going to be the only way, he says. “Everybody in Belgium always watches English TV anyway!”',\n",
       "  'I tell him I recently watched footage of him playing as a young boy and his style has hardly changed. Even if you blocked out his face, it could only be De Bruyne. “I know!” He takes out his phone and compares two photographs. “This is from a couple of months ago when I scored against Bournemouth. Look at the way I kick the ball. And this is a picture of me shooting when I was a kid. Identical! Same technique!”',\n",
       "  'Are Mason, six, and Rome, almost four, promising footballers? “No,” he says. “They don’t play.” Are they not interested? “I don’t know,” he says, as if he’s never considered it. “They like to go to the football. My oldest plays piano a bit and likes to run. He’s a good runner.”',\n",
       "  'I ask about the famous stories. Did you really cling to the goalpost and refuse to budge? “I think the stories are a bit made up.” So it’s not true? “I don’t remember it. It could be true!” Does it sound like him ? He grins. “I was a little bit stubborn, yeah. I let most things go, but when I do say something I am outspoken. I know now when you speak as a teenager or a kid to an adult with an opinion, people don’t like it … even if it’s true.”',\n",
       "  'Was that the case when you suggested your Genk teammates were not trying? De Bruyne pinkens. He often flushes like this – when he’s embarrassed, when he’s upset on the pitch and when he’s made one of his superhuman runs. “Yes! The problem is the fans like that and other people like that, but the team doesn’t.”',\n",
       "  'A hairdresser is here to give everyone a trim before the photoshoot. While it’s De Bruyne’s turn, I chat to Lacroix. She’s a model, a social influencer (with more than 350,000 Instagram followers) and she recently started a Flemish podcast called Secret Society with a few Belgian girlfriends. Her parents are physiotherapists and she wanted to be a doctor when she was at school. “I never thought my life would look like this. Getting a degree was my main goal then.” When she was 17 and De Bruyne was 21, they started dating. Apart from it being her husband’s career, she has no interest in football and certainly had no ambition to be a footballer’s wife. Can she see what makes him a special player? “I don’t know a lot about football, but I think he sees things before the others maybe. He’s always one step ahead?”',\n",
       "  'She’s encouraging Suri to finish her fruit. “Everyone thinks she’s called Surrey,” she says. “‘Ello, Surrey!’” She does a good impression of a cockney. Rome is building a racetrack on his mini computer. He shows me how to do it, but I can’t keep up. Mason asks for a go of my tape recorder. “I’m going to interview you. What’s it like working for media? What’s your favourite colour?”',\n",
       "  'De Bruyne emerges from his haircut looking pleased with himself. “I’m like 24 now! I could be a model!” We head back into his office and he and Lacroix sit together on the sofa. I ask her how life has changed since they got together. For starters, she says, they weren’t living anywhere like here. Back then he was just making a name for himself and they could pretty much do what they wanted socially. “Football-wise, it’s got better and better. But then we could do more normal stuff. On a city trip, say, maybe two or three people would come up to us. Now we’re more isolated. So you do more things at home with friends. Kevin has grown more open because we’re in such an intimate circle, always with the same group. He’s more comfortable with who he is.”',\n",
       "  '“I’m more open-minded to life,” De Bruyne says. “When I was younger, it was just football. Now I have a family, life is different.” In fact, he says, it’s remarkably similar to many other working people – he drops the kids off on his way to work, trains, comes home, family meal with the kids, helps with the homework, watches telly. ',\n",
       "  'He admits there is one way their life is noticeably different from the rest of ours – they spend more money on stuff. This is partly because they can and partly because they pay extra to buy their privacy. “We have to live our life in a more secluded way. Often, if we go on a tour it will be a private tour, and most of the time this stuff is more expensive and more individual.”',\n",
       "  'Lacroix says this is not a choice. When she and the kids go out without De Bruyne, they can do whatever they want. But with him it’s a different story. “Yesterday we thought we’d try going to the fair and Kevin made at least 100 pictures. Maybe 150. And the kids had to wait all the time, and it wasn’t enjoyable for them. At one point security came up and we thought they’d help, then they said, ‘Can we have a picture?’” She laughs. ',\n",
       "  'She’s not asking for sympathy, she says. In so many ways it’s a wonderful, privileged life. But it isn’t without problems. “When I’ve been driving to the club lately,” De Bruyne says, “there have been people driving next to me and filming. People have followed me.”',\n",
       "  'After games, Lacroix adds, “People just jump in front of the car so you can’t drive. Then the one next to them goes for a picture so you can’t go anywhere.”',\n",
       "  'Top footballers get paid ludicrous salaries and are idolised by their supporters. De Bruyne is City’s best-paid player, earning an estimated £385,000 a week – £20m a year. In 2020, he cut ties with his long-term agent, Patrick De Koster, after he was arrested on suspicion of fraud. The investigation was reportedly triggered by complaints from De Bruyne himself. Last year, he negotiated his own contract extension using data analysts to prove his worth to the club.',\n",
       "  'All the money and worship must change you, I say. “I don’t necessarily think it’s the money, it’s the attention. If you go from no attention to wherever you go people give you attention, then that changes you. You either take everything in or block everything out. Some people like all the attention, but after a while it becomes so much you get eaten up by it. Then if you push it out you seem arrogant. It’s a thin line you have to walk.”',\n",
       "  'In terms of attention, he says, it’s harder for the top English players: “Because I’m a foreigner living here, I’m still OK. When you’re an English player, the attention flows from everywhere. It would be too much for me.” ',\n",
       "  'Does he think he gets paid too much? “No. I compare it to a singer at a concert and 60,000 people come. I look at it logically. There are millions of people watching the football on TV, there’s 60,000 watching the games, the income of a club is £500-£600m. Yeah, it’s a lot of money, but is it too much? If the club can afford it, it’s not too much. It’s not a popular answer, but that’s how I see it.”',\n",
       "  'How hard is it for them to relate to people struggling with the cost of living crisis? “We are really close to our family and friends, and most of them have normal jobs, so we know the struggles,” Lacroix says. ',\n",
       "  'She looks at De Bruyne and asks him to translate an expression. “We stay with our feet on the ground,” he says. “It’s easier for us to understand, but it will be harder for the kids because they’re used to a certain lifestyle. They go to a private school and there are people from similar backgrounds. They understand when we go to see our families it’s different types of houses and another lifestyle.” It worries him: “We’ll try, but it cannot be the same as when we grew up. It’s not possible.”',\n",
       "  'When he was a child, he says, his parents didn’t have much, but it was plenty: “We had what we needed; a nice garden.” Does he have siblings? “One sister. She did trampoline and was pretty good at it. But she didn’t have the character to go on like I did.”',\n",
       "  'So many promising footballers fall by the wayside. Fewer than 0.5% of the kids in English academies at the age of nine make it as professionals at any level. So what is character? “It’s will. It’s saying no to fun stuff. At 17, 18, a new social life is beginning, people are going out, having fun with friends, and you have to say no.” That must be hard? “It is, and that’s why many people fall down at that stage. You have to become an adult quickly in football. When you start playing with the first team, you’re living with 30-, 35-year-olds; people with kids. It’s not easy and you need to learn that quickly, because if you don’t, you fall out. Elite sport is brutal.”',\n",
       "  'Did he find it tough as a teen? “Yes. I also missed part of my life because I went away from 14. We’d play on a Saturday, then I would go home to see my parents and on Sunday evening I’d travel back. So I missed the whole social part of my life.” Was he jealous of his friends? “Not at that time. Maybe afterwards. Later, when you experience things, you think perhaps it would have been fun to be doing this when everybody else was.”',\n",
       "  'It was his decision to leave home at 14: he was desperate to play football, and his parents were supportive. ',\n",
       "  'I ask if the story about being dumped by his foster family is true. “Yes,” he says. “There were three of us and the other two were more sociable. At summer break I said bye to the family and went home. Then my parents told me, you’re not going back, they don’t want you any more.” He says the foster family never said anything directly, but told his parents they didn’t want him because he was too quiet, too difficult, a teenager who didn’t fit in. To add insult to injury, Genk told him he had to go to boarding school instead. In Belgium, boarding schools are more for problematic than privileged students. “I really didn’t want to do it.”',\n",
       "  'Did that rejection make him question his character? “No. I thought I’m going to push more and show them. I said to my parents, I will do good, you’ll see. I’ll be in the first team quickly, then everything will change.”',\n",
       "  'There is a YouTube film about De Bruyne that depicts his life as a triumph over tragedy. “Right from the beginning he was abandoned by his foster family,” it says. “And still life didn’t stop hitting him with tragedy after tragedy.” It goes on to document how the 20-year-old signed for Chelsea in a £7m deal and played only three Premier League games before being sold as a flop.',\n",
       "  'Has he seen the film? “No.” In the film, it mentions a match in which he came on as a half-time substitute and scored five goals. Every goal, it says, was a way of answering the foster family: “One goal, they don’t want you any more. Two goals, too quiet. Three goals, too difficult. Four goals, they don’t want you any more. Five goals, because of who you are.” When I describe this, he turns a pinker shade of pink. “That’s not true. I don’t know who said that, but it’s not true. I find that a little bit embarrassing, to be fair.” Now he’s laughing. “My life wasn’t that bad, to be honest!” ',\n",
       "  'De Bruyne says too much was made of his time at Chelsea when he left, and too much was made when he returned to the Premier League a couple of years later with Manchester City. “When I came here people said, ‘Chelsea reject.’ No, I was just a young boy who didn’t play and was there for six months. I was really young.”',\n",
       "  'Leaving Chelsea was the making of him. He signed for Bundesliga club Wolfsburg in 2014 for £18m, ended the 2014-15 season with 16 goals and 27 assists in all competitions and was named Germany’s footballer of the year. In August 2015, Manchester City signed him for £55m. Those who remembered his unhappy time at Chelsea couldn’t believe how much City paid for him. Former Liverpool player Phil Thompson said: “The world is going mad. The amount of money they’re paying for this boy is just absolutely bonkers.” But it turned out to be a bargain. In four of his seven seasons, he has been voted player of the season, and City have won the Premier League four of the past five seasons. In 2017-18 they became the first (and still only) club to get 100 points in a season and the following season won an unprecedented clean sweep of domestic trophies.',\n",
       "  'Eight months after De Bruyne arrived at City, Pep Guardiola became manager. It was the catalyst for the club’s greatest run in its history. For most of my life as a City fan, I was used to nothing but failure; between 1976 and 2011 the club didn’t win a trophy. Thanks to huge investment from its UAE owners, the signing of great players and arguably the best manager in the world, City have dominated the Premier League for the past decade.',\n",

It’s rare he can go to something for them. Two of the kids are at school, so we only have weekends to do things with them, but Kevin is playing then.

Yet the reality of those days was never as good as our sepia-tinted collective memories suggest, and all recent transactions for Premier League clubs indicate it will be financially driven buyers looking to acquire England’s leading clubs.

       "  'The institute’s research found that less than 10% of the abusive tweets were identity attacks that referred to a protected characteristic such as race, gender or sexuality. However, Hannah Kirk, an online safety researcher at the institute, said racist or nationality-based abuse might be more prevalent at the World Cup.',\n",
       "  '“I envisage the big difference between the Premier League and the World Cup is global attention and also heightened awareness of nationalism, which potentially intensifies the stereotypical links between race and nation. We might then see a little bit more racism or nationality-directed abuse than we would in the Premier League,” Kirk said.',\n",

Only in Europe is it possible to have a great career in top-level football.',\n",

       "  'The dominance in club football is even clearer. Everything is pointing towards Europe, to the five big leagues, and this trend has intensified since the creation of the Champions League in 1992. The last world-class footballers to really shine outside Europe were Pelé and Zico. Diego Maradona spent his best years in Spain and Italy, Lionel Messi went to Barcelona as a child, Neymar at 21. From the starting XI of the last non-European world champions, Brazil 2002, only one never played in Europe: Marcos, the goalkeeper.',\n",

The Netherlands, the three-time World Cup finalists, defeated African champions Senegal. For the French, Australia will not have been the last opponent against whom they are superior in all positions. From the first minute, Spain once again displayed the clear style that sets them apart from everyone else: attacking possession. The 7-0 against Costa Rica was an uneven duel. Belgium, Denmark, Poland and Croatia were also well organised. Europe’s players perform and thanks to them the tournament is attractive.',\n",
       "  'Italy, the European champions, are not in the tournament, nor are the former World Cup finalists Sweden and Hungary. Nor are the Czech Republic and Slovakia, who, when they were part of the same country were in the final twice. Erling Haaland, possibly one of the defining strikers of the next decade, is absent in Qatar because the European qualifying section was too strong for Norway. If World Cup places were awarded according to only sporting criteria, Europe would have more than 13 of the 32 participants in Qatar.',\n",

The U.S. team’s three group stage matches start against Wales on Nov. 21, followed by England on Nov. 25 and Iran on Nov. 29, with only the top two from the quartet qualifying for the knockout stages.',\n",
       "  '“Yeah, we’re underdogs,” says Aaronson, who grew up in Medford, N.J. “But going into the World Cup … we want to win, so we’re going to give it our all and try to go to the final.”',\n",

       "  'It’s a hard-nosed attitude that persuaded Leeds United manager Jesse Marsch—who in February became just the third American to manage an EPL team—to build his team around Aaronson and former New York Red Bulls midfielder Tyler Adams, who is also heading to Qatar. “He’s a silent assassin type,” Marsch says of Aaronson. “He’s just the nicest kid, you don’t think that he’s a hard-edged guy, but when it comes to game time, he’s willing to do whatever it takes to find a way to succeed.”',\n",
       "  'Alliteration demands that Aaronson is dubbed by fans the “Medford Messi”—after diminutive Argentina legend Lionel Messi, who will also be playing in Qatar—although he in fact lists his soccer idols as former England midfielder Steven Gerrard and Spain striker Fernando Torres, who both starred for Liverpool in the 2000s. “I wear my hairband because of Fernando Torres,” Aaronson reveals. “I got [the style] from him.”',\n",
       "  'Aaronson played all kinds of sports as a kid, including baseball, basketball, lacrosse, and American football. But soccer was always his passion and one he happened to share with his private investigator father, Rusty, who played college soccer for Monmouth University. ',\n",
       "  '“From a young age, my dad always told me that ‘I want you to be the one that runs the most,’” says Aaronson. “It was never ‘train like this, do that,’ the only thing he wanted from me was just to work harder than anybody else.”',\n",
       "  'The elder Aaronson even set up a youth soccer team in the neighborhood chiefly to provide his son with a competitive sporting environment to nurture his undoubted potential. “[My dad is] the most important character in my career,” says Aaronson. “I’ve had a lot of fantastic coaches over the years, but my dad is the number one person in my life who has helped me get to where I am today, and who I based my morals off.”',\n",
       "  'Aaronson played for Philadelphia Union’s youth teams from the age of 13, joining the Union-run high school at YSC Sports in Wayne, N.J. He says growing up in Medford was “a kid’s dream.” Aaronson and his buddies would bike all over the town, which is interspersed by small lakes. Summers revolved around playing soccer in friends’ backyards and then diving into the water to cool off. “I was fortunate to grow up the way I did.”',\n",
       "  'He was accepted to attend Indiana University before deciding at the 11th hour to instead sign a professional contract with the senior Union team, where his 19-year-old brother, Paxten, plays today. Asked which of the siblings is the superior player, Aaronson grins and throws his younger brother a tribute, even if fraternal rivalry prohibits full bragging rights. ',\n",
       "  '“My brother is so talented,” he says. “I always like to say how good he is. He’s going to get more chances as he gets older because he’s still young, of course.” Notably, both brothers scored in their first Major League Soccer (MLS) starts.',\n",
       "  'As for his own game, Aaronson’s not coy about areas where he can improve. “There’re so many things,” he says. “I can score more goals and get more assists. I want to get stronger, so I’ve been in the gym a lot.” He is also first to admit that going professional in his teens was risky coming from an American sports system, where the established route is college and draft, supposedly providing a safety net should things go awry. “It is a different culture [in soccer],” he says. “With me, it was more about just taking the chance of a lifetime.”',\n",
       "  'The gamble worked. In October 2020, Aaronson was signed by Austria’s Red Bull Salzburg in a deal reported to be worth up to $9 million, the highest transfer fee ever paid for a homegrown American player from the MLS. Aaronson made the transition to Europe seem easy, winning a league and cup double in both his two seasons at the club. But in truth, he says leaving his family to move alone to a faraway country where he didn’t speak the language was a huge challenge at such a tender age. At the Union, Aaronson was still living at home with his mom cooking and caring for him.',\n",
       "  '“Going to grocery stores, trying to find the food that I needed, there were just a bunch of things that were tough [in Salzburg],” he says. “I was lonely at times, but I got used to it and I really had time to focus on my football and get better.”',\n",
       "  'Read More: Climate Change Drove Nepali Workers to Qatar to Build the World Cup Stadiums. It Also Made Their Jobs More Dangerous',\n",
       "  'The transition from Salzburg to Leeds was easier and Aaronson’s all-action displays immediately cemented his place as a fan favorite. “Leeds are soccer fanatics and in Philly, it’s all sports, so it’s kind of similar,” he says. “The fans are just so loud and really drive us on.” And he’s found English culture easier to adapt to: “I’ve tried the tea, I’m into tea, I change up between coffee and tea,” he laughs. Ultimately, though, there are some South Jersey staples that the U.K. just cannot replicate. “I love the hoagies back home,” he says, “they’re the best.”',\n",
       "  'While he is currently living alone in the historic spa town of Harrogate near Leeds’ training ground, Aaronson will be joined by his girlfriend—who recently graduated from college in the U.S.—after Christmas, which his parents plan to spend with him in the U.K. “Christmas in England!” he grins. “Can’t wait to see it.”',\n",
       "  'In the meantime, cognizant of how short and uncertain professional sporting careers can be, he’s been knuckling down to online college courses at Southern New Hampshire University arranged as part of his Union deal. “I’m not really sure what I want to specialize in,” he admits. “I’m just getting some credits done but have been slowing down a little bit because it’s been busy and then the World Cup is coming up.”',\n",
       "  'Nobody is sure quite how this Team USA will fare on the world’s biggest stage. Coach Gregg Berhalter made the bold choice to ditch the fading veterans—who flunked their bid to qualify for the 2018 Russia World Cup—and instead cultivate a youthful squad with the energy and athleticism to engage an aggressive pressing style. Aaronson’s tireless running and ability to retain the ball under pressure encapsulates the shift from the previous generation’s direct approach to a more sophisticated possession-oriented philosophy.',\n",
       "  'But whereas Leeds have built their team around Aaronson as the playmaker roaming behind their main striker, Berhalter has leveraged his versatility, deploying him variously on either wing or farther back in deep midfield. “Gregg is very tactically aware and I learned a lot from him,” says Aaronson. “In the national team, I sometimes have to roll up my sleeves and play wider and deeper. It’s just about being flexible.”',\n",
       "  'While the squad’s talent is undeniable, a deliberate focus on youth, coupled with the fact the U.S. failed to qualify last time out, means big tournament experience is sorely lacking. Much will hinge on how well Berhalter, who himself was part of the U.S. squad that made the World Cup quarter finals in 2002, can guide his young charges. Those who know Aaronson best don’t expect the occasion to overwhelm him, though. “Brenden can have a big World Cup, no doubt,” says Marsch. ',\n",
       "  'Regardless of the team’s performance, the popularity of soccer is set to keep rising in the U.S. Cultural phenomena like the success of shows Ted Lasso and Welcome to Wrexham, as well as the fact the next World Cup in 2026 is being held across North America, is belatedly boosting the global game at home. ',\n",
       "  '“By the 2026 World Cup, I think [soccer] will overtake some other sports in America … It’s rising up to baseball” says Aaronson. “2026 is going to be hysteria in the country—and it’s going to be awesome to see.”',\n",

With the shift, it creates a wider pool of players, and these players are starting to be recognised for their talent. It’s amazing and inspiring for other young players.”',\n",

But he adds that there is a key prohibitive factor: the cost of youth football, particularly if a player reaches higher levels such as the National Premier League, Australia’s second tier. ',\n",
       "  '“I think Australia would be ranked a lot higher in the world if they gave more diverse players opportunities,” he says. “It’s been a massive challenge, and I have no doubt whatsoever that it has impacted the national team selection. We should have a far more diverse team, and I think in years to come, the team will change.',\n",

Southgate’s assistant was on the backroom staff at Chelsea when they became European champions 10 years ago and he remains proud of how Roberto Di Matteo’s unfancied side stopped a peak Lionel Messi from scoring when they reached the final of the Champions League at the expense of Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona.',\n",
       "  '“There are a handful of players you need to consider special attention to,” Holland says. “Messi has been one and probably still is. You’d have to put Mbappé in that kind of category. We need to look at trying to avoid leaving ourselves in situations where he is as devastating as we’ve all seen.”',\n",

He would play a soldier against him to try to stop him, but then you don’t get any threat from your team from the soldier. You’re just stopping somebody. You’re not actually hurting them. Then he would try to play [Cristiano] Ronaldo one against one because Alves was fantastic going forwards but maybe not quite as good defensively as a consequence.',\n",
       "  '“There is a plus and a minus to every one. It’s that cat and mouse of: ‘Yes, we have got to try to deal with him, but we also have to try to exploit the weakness that his super-strength delivers.’ Trying to adapt your team to cover for that while still trying to create your own problems is the challenge.',\n",
       "  '“I would like to think we won’t just be looking to stop a player. We would be looking to try to do everything possible to limit his super-strength while still trying to focus on our own strengths because we have good players; players just as likely to cause France trouble as Mbappé would be to us. We have to find that balance.”',\n",
       "  'The obvious question, then, is whether England keep faith with their 4-3-3 and back Kyle Walker to stop Mbappé flying down the left. Or is this the moment to switch to a back five, protect Stones and Maguire by moving Walker to right centre-back and start Kieran Trippier at right wing-back?',\n",
       "  '“The perception has been that the five is more negative than the four, which I don’t completely agree with,” says Holland, who explains why England used a five against Germany and Italy at Euro 2020. “Germany played 3-4-3 and we felt that if we matched them up we could be superior individually.”',\n",
       "  'But was it necessary when England met Italy in the final? “You could go either way. They had and still have a similar way of playing where they create five players high in attack. If you’ve got four at the back, you get overloaded at times and that can cause a tactical problem, so that was part of the rationale in that game.',\n",

Jude has those mental attributes. There has been an evolution physically in the last 12 months. It has taken him to another level.”',\n",
       "  'Holland considers Bellingham’s experience at Borussia Dortmund. “The Bundesliga is a good league to develop in. It’s probably not quite as challenging every week as the Premier League. He gets a fair share of games where he is comfortable and enjoying playing on the ball and not always on the limit, which for a young player is a good way to develop.

Its collapse, and the likely departures of FSG and the Glazers, are all signs that the nation-state clubs are winning this. The cartel is, frankly, in disarray. Barcelona have sold their future in return for a wonky version of the present. Juventus Ronaldo’d themselves in search of an illusory next level.',\n",

The arrival of Todd Boehly at Chelsea is evidence US investors and their partners still see major potential for growth here, that football’s value will simply continue to rise. And yet, somehow, watching Boehly it is hard to shake a slight sense of doubt. Are we through the good billionaires? Is Boehly the Liz Truss of the Premier League ownership party, the sediment at the bottom of the barrel, the comedy endgame? Does this really feel like a convincing version of the future, fit to push Abu Dhabi and Qatar?',\n",
       "  'It is still a rising tide out there, a product that is relentlessly in demand. And with the old guard on their way out this leaves seven Premier League clubs with US owners or investors. Perhaps the future is a more dynamic form of entrepreneurial growth, the kind of stuff Boehly has been sketching out: tuning the details, introducing new gimmickry, even another great pivot.',\n",
       "  'The identity of the new owners at Old Trafford and Anfield will tell us a great deal about Premier League ownership 3.0. But it is already hard to avoid two conclusions. First that this is still all within the blast radius of the Super League, collateral to that failed coup. And second, that what the Glazers will leave behind is something desiccated and emptied out, another host body for football’s own vampiric late capitalism.',\n",
       "  'With no rules around countries and their investment funds owning clubs, or on how private investors can pillage these assets, the hunt for ‘good owners’ will continue. For now the market will decide. For United fans there is perhaps consolation in the simple fact that, at the very least, it won’t be this.'],\n",

       " ['Arsenal striker was not unfairly treated but let the focus now switch to increasing diversity in English women’s football',\n",
       "  'Last Friday night, after England’s consistently impressive women’s football team beat Japan 4-0, Ian Wright and Eni Aluko cut to the heart of a different story about a lack of diversity in the game. “It’s a systemic problem and we are just dealing with it in incidents,” Wright said when asked to comment on my interview with Beth Mead in the Guardian last week.',\n",
       "  'Aluko, once an outstanding England international like Wright, and now the sporting director of Angel City in the American National Women’s Soccer League, agreed. “It’s not a Beth problem,” she said. “It is a systemic problem.”',\n",
       "  'This key distinction was lost on social media because Mead had been subjected to unacceptable abuse. One question, which needed to be asked, had turned the issue into “a Mead problem”. It has since become another “incident” that obscures systemic racism in the development of women’s football.',\n",
       "  'I don’t think either Mead or I handled this small but crucial part of an otherwise positive interview correctly. Towards the end of our allocated slot I mentioned to Mead that, in contrast to the England men’s team, her squad consisted of mainly white women. “Is there an obvious explanation why or is it just coincidental?” I asked. That loaded word “coincidental” was a clumsy way of asking whether there could be any alternative reason to systemic racism.',\n",
       "  'Mead said: “I think it’s completely coincidental. We put out our best 11 and you don’t think of anyone’s race or anything like that. I think that’s more an outsider’s perspective.”',\n",
       "  'After the interview was published online last Tuesday, Mead asked Arsenal to contact me to see whether I would be willing to add some “context”. I agreed and carried the full text that Arsenal supplied to me, which they and Mead produced together: “Mead believes more should be done to ensure football is accessible for everyone at grassroots level to ensure diversity at all levels. But she insists she doesn’t think there is concern in regard to racism in elite women’s football.”',\n",
       "  'So I was surprised that, on the same Friday night when Wright and Aluko spoke so thoughtfully, Mead took a different tack in an interview with Sky Sports. After the game against Japan, she complained that she had made additional comments relating to diversity in our interview that had not been included. This is simply untrue – a fact accepted by everyone who has heard the recording. It is also not helpful to Mead or to the wider conversations we need about the lack of diversity in some areas of women’s football.',\n",
       "  '“I think it was unfair how it was written,” she told Sky. “My values and beliefs are completely different to how it was written. It’s not a true reflection of me as a person. In terms of diversity and everything in the game I want to be there, front and centre, and helping with that. I know the FA are doing a lot for that and I actually said that in the interview. That didn’t get put through on the interview. So unfortunately it made me look worse in that context but, yeah, unfortunately these things happen in the media these days … sometimes, don’t believe everything you read.”',\n",
       "  'Mead’s allegations against me obviously matter far less than troubling questions of racism in sport. But it feels right to add some background. In terms of “fairness” I actually should have pressed Mead further. As the Times reported last weekend: “There were only three mixed-heritage players in the England squad which won Euro 2022, and it is estimated that the proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic players in the Women’s Super League is between 10-15% – compared with about 33% in the Premier League.”',\n",
       "  'As the audio of our interview shows I um-ed and ah-ed aloud during a long pause after Mead’s answer. In those few seconds I was in the midst of deciding whether to ask further questions on race and football during such a tough personal time for Mead and her family. In the end I chose not to grill Mead on the issue because it felt as if others in positions of power need to be asked harder questions – rather than a young woman still reeling a little from a tumultuous year of glory and worry.',\n",
       "  'Mead agreed to our interview as a way of publicising her new book. We spoke about many subjects and Mead addressed her past insecurities honestly. I am confident I presented a balanced feature on her. She is quoted accurately as every answer in each interview I do is transcribed in full. My questions are just summarised but in this case, in print, I should have used the exact words I said on the recording. Instead, in the original version I wondered whether “this anomaly suggests there might be a residual issue of racial prejudice in the development of English women’s football”.',\n",

       "  'Mead has had an extraordinary year and she has been rightly lauded for her achievements. The same is true of her England team. After decades of prejudice against female footballers, Mead and her teammates burst into mainstream sport this summer. It was thrilling but it still seemed strange that the overwhelming majority of their European championship-winning squad was white when football is loved and played successfully by all races in this country.',\n",
       "  'Brushing aside an obvious discrepancy, blaming the media or insisting that there are no such problems in the highest echelons of the game does not make the issue disappear for all those who rightly champion women’s football.',\n",
       "  'Meanwhile, two white people becoming embroiled in an “incident” relating to just one question about diversity distracts attention from the systemic racism that should be our primary focus. Wright and Aluko, speaking with measured clarity, reminded us of this truth. “I called Beth and spoke to her,” Wright told ITV as he reflected on our interview. “We had a great chat. I’m very fond of Beth and yes, it was a bit disappointing seeing that. What was said will obviously stay between us but I think it was a massive moment of reflection and learning for her.”',\n",
       "  'For Aluko the paucity of diversity in women’s football is “a problem for me that is about recruitment and recruitment practices. It’s about making sure we are widening the pool of players for Sarina Wiegman [England’s manager] to choose from, for the younger age groups to choose from, for the academies to choose from”. She said “the talent is absolutely there” but “the inclusion is not”.',\n",
       "  'Wright added that “it’s not a new conversation either. It always feels like we’re starting from scratch”. But his urgency was striking: “There’re still lots of resources and energy that go into [combating] racism in the men’s game. What you want is the same energy and resources in the women’s game.”'],\n",

       "  'Once upon a time, there was a footballer called Brian McClair, who was renowned for many things. Unusually, he combined the early part of his career with university study, reading maths, physics, chemistry and statistics at Glasgow – though it was never clear whether it was this or his accent that caused Bryan Robson to observe that “he’s meant to be funny but none of us can understand him”. McClair is also owner of Choccy, one of football’s classic nicknames – “as his last name rhymed with the delicacy ‘chocolate éclair’,” advises Wikipedia – and earned the admiration of the great Lord Ferg for his devotion to training in shorts regardless of the weather. He was also lauded for his devastating finishing in and around the goalline. Had the Puskás Award existed in 1991-92, he would surely have won it for the beauty that can be seen at 1m20s here.',\n",
       "  'But most of all, McClair was renowned for his snot rocket prowess, inspiring playground accidents and scuffles across the British Isles. For the uninitiated, this involves pressing one nostril with a fingertip – though like the Beatles taking inspiration from Dylan then overcomplicating, Paul Ince modified the technique to deploy both – before sniffing downwards through the other, expelling its contents like Mary Poppins emptying her bag. The skill was best deployed immediately after McClair’s team had scored a goal when trailing; he would race into the net and wrestle the opposing keeper to retrieve the ball, then tuck it under an arm and perform before planting it on the centre spot so that the game could resume as quickly as possible.',\n",

Four minutes, zero explanations, less than zero accountability. For a long time, it’s been possible to leave a game without actually having seen one. Amazingly, though, in the horrendous abomination of the HR World Cup, this easily resolvable nonsense has been partially addressed. Of course, referees’ watches remain classified.

The thought he might do so had, in the bluntest terms, not crossed anyone’s mind in the aftermath of his cardiac arrest last June but there is a tantalising sense the story may only be part way through.',\n",

       "  '“It has always been strong but the belief, in the squad and from the fans, was bigger when I came back,” Eriksen said when asked whether, on resuming international duty in March, he had stepped into a different Denmark team. The blend of emotion, pride, togetherness and sheer skill that brought them to the Euro 2020 semi-finals after that fateful afternoon at Parken has bred an irresistible juggernaut: they qualified for this winter’s competition with ease and, earlier this year, beat France both home and away in the Nations League.',\n",
       "  'It is the French with whom they will presumably grapple for top spot in Group D unless Australia or Tunisia, their opponents at Education City Stadium on Tuesday, spring a surprise. “France in a tournament is a different team compared to the rest of the year,” said Eriksen, using characteristic modesty but applying fair logic too. Competing with the elite over four weeks may take something different. “We’re dreaming of something big,” he said. “But in the end we have to get there.”',\n",
       "  'The challenge facing Kasper Hjulmand, Denmark’s urbane manager, is to plot the path. The ultimate leap is to be a side that wins semi-finals and finals. His players could not have been accused of robbery if they had clung on to beat England at Wembley last summer but he has always said the better team won.',\n",
       "  '“The quality of the team is very, very good but I don’t think we’re up there with the very best,” Hjulmand said. “We’ve been discussing it a lot with the players: how can we still try to get there? We are trying to [do it] and climb the last percentages against the best teams.”',\n",
       "  'Eriksen’s addition to the unit that, without his peerless ingenuity, captured so many imaginations should help tilt the numbers favourably. The team looks nicely balanced, with Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Thomas Delaney to either side of him in midfield while Simon Kjær, feted for his reaction to Eriksen’s collapse, has returned from long-term injury to anchor the defence. Atalanta’s Joakim Mæhle will bomb on from left-back while Mikkel Damsgaard and Kasper Dolberg remain bright sparks in attack.',\n",
       "  'Denmark are riding a wave and their longevity has been a pleasant surprise to Hjulmand. “We didn’t know if it was ‘Euro football fever’ in Denmark or just football fever,” he said. “And it was football fever. It’s crazy in Denmark at the moment. I think we’re in a good position. You cannot just go by emotions, to play well we need quality on the pitch, but I think the football quality is there and we’re ready.”',\n",
       "  'When France visited Parken two months ago, demand for tickets reached 120,000. That is more than four times Parken’s capacity but the atmosphere Denmark face in their opener may hinder rather than help. Tunisian supporters have travelled in numbers to Qatar and up to 30,000 could be in the stands: a reliably awkward, often tricky opponent will feel at home and test the Danes’ ability to set a resounding tone.',\n",

       "  'There is the impression Fifa has done little to earn trust and the Danish FA’s sporting director, Peter Møller, bore that out on Saturday after hearing Gianni Infantino’s extraordinary soliloquy that morning. “My personal opinion is he says some appalling things,” Møller said, bristling against the president’s criticism of Europe and pointing out Denmark have worked behind the scenes to help effect change in Qatar. “I don’t understand anything he’s saying. It shows me we are doing the right thing when, the day before the World Cup, he spends almost all his time speaking about all the things we have helped push forward.”',\n",

       "  'Awer Mabil’s extraordinary story begins in the Kakuma refugee camp, Kenya, but he doesn’t want it to end there. He doesn’t want your pity, either. Born to parents fleeing the Sudanese civil war, raised in a small hut, he went half way round the world then half way back again to become a professional footballer in Denmark, Portugal, Tukey and Spain. He is, he points out, one of only four Australians to score in the Champions League and now he’s going to the World Cup. In fact, it was his penalty, at sudden death in the playoff, that ultimately took the country there.',\n",
       "  'He has become a hero and, he hopes, an inspiration, embarked upon a hell of a journey against the odds. After all, he says: “When you come to Europe from Australia you’re nobody, you don’t have the respect, so you have to really work, fight.” But he knows that is not the part people usually focus on; instead his origins in Kakuma eclipse all else. And that, he admits, “starts to piss me off a lot”.',\n",
       "  '“I’ve got that title now of ‘oh, refugee kid’. It’s more for the headlines, for people to try to feel sorry for me, but they never try to understand who I am,” Mabil explains. “Not many would say: ‘he came from Australia to now play in La Liga.’ They’ll say ‘from refugee to …’ I lived in the refugee camp. I was born there, I was there until 10 when I moved to Australia. And I lived in Australia 10 years, so it’s half-half. When you pick just one side for a headline or to make people feel bad, you’re forgetting my other half. And I want to be there for everybody.',\n",
       "  '“When I arrived in Europe I had dreams to chase and a responsibility to encourage other kids: not to feel bad for my story but like ‘let’s understand how this guy faces a challenge’. I want to tell that story too, inspire people from my country, my mother’s country, around the world: that’s more important than being labelled with one thing. Some might hear my refugee story and say ‘that’s inspiring’, ‘that’s beautiful’, but others might be like ‘yeah, he’s not really …’, you know? There are kids in Australia I want to inspire, to show them there’s a path.”',\n",
       "  'In mid-June, he showed them alright, there when Australia needed him. They had drawn 0-0 with Peru in the playoff and after five penalties each, the shootout had reached sudden death. Mabil stood on the spot, alone, “in my own world”, the weight of a country upon him. He had missed in training the day before; now he scored, then watched substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne save from Alex Valera. Afterwards, Mabil called his penalty a thank you to the nation. His hotel room, he said, was bigger than the hut he had grown up in: Australia had given “me and my family a chance of life”.',\n",
       "  'Mabil says: “It’s heartbreaking because on the journey my mum and her parents went through to reach the camp many people died. They were captured by the rebels trying to leave. The way they escaped, we could talk about it all night. It sounds like something from a movie but it’s something they actually went through. The war, the journey, what they faced. For me, hearing it, it’s like: ‘Woah’. What people do to keep their kids safe, what they sacrifice to give them a better life. They didn’t know how long they would be in the refugee camp, they thought they would return home. But there’s no returning home.',\n",
       "  '“I was 10 when we left Kakuma. I remember being loaded on the back of the motorbikes, my friends running after us. ‘Hey!’ ‘Hey!’ Growing up we used to say: ‘going abroad is the best thing ever’, ‘everything’s ok there, no worries’. But leaving was hard and when I came abroad, to Adelaide, I was like: ‘I want to go back.’ Our culture was always being together. I came to Australia, you have a house and it’s fenced off. You feel you can’t go and engage with the people next door. I didn’t speak the language. The first few months, I hated it.”',\n",

In Kakuma, Mabil had played barefooted with balls of socks; in Adelaide, it was different but still football. “And football,” he says, “is the world game, a language everybody speaks.” It helps when you’re good at it. Mabil laughs. “Everybody wants to be on your team, yeah!” he says. “Football has been my life’s guide.”',\n",
       "  'Mabil was very good at it. Inspired by Tim Cahill, only 17 on his professional debut, he set off to Europe: Midtjylland, Esbjerg, Paços de Ferreira, Kasimpasa, Cádiz. Internationals followed, and now a World Cup. “In Kakuma, I didn’t have access to watch games so when I came Australia and saw 2006 it was like: Wow! And this country is part of it? Wow. Staying up all night. I remember the final so clear with Zidane’s headbutt. And then 2010: my mum, all my family staying up, even more special because it was Africa. Now to be part of it is such a big thing.”',\n",
       "  'He made it so, for all of them. “When I was going up to take the penalty, everything shut off,” he recalls. “Just me and that ball. There’s a little thing I do before, see if the keeper buys it or not – a trade secret I’ll keep to myself for a little bit; maybe after the World Cup I can say! Then I shoot. My normal routine. I’m thinking: just do what you always do.”',\n",
       "  'Well, not always. “After every session, every player took a penalty and the day before I actually missed,” Mabil reveals. “I said ‘no, no, I’m not happy with this.’ I didn’t feel right so I told the coach I want to take it again. I [re-]did it so that the next day I felt comfortable. You bring your luck: if I hadn’t retaken that the day before I would have had a negative feeling. ‘Shit, now it’s 50-50’.”',\n",
       "  'Mabil’s goal left Redmayne to clinch their World Cup place. Sent on for the shootout, he was playing the clown, leaping about his line. “I don’t even think the goalkeepers knew he was going to come on,” Mabil admits. “Matty [Ryan] is our captain, he played in the Premier League for years, he’s our No 1, so I was shocked. I saw Matty, we had eye contact, it was the last minute. But how he handled showed why he’s our captain. He set the ego aside. ‘Ok, this is my role’.”',\n",
       "  'Redmayne saved, his antics getting into Peruvian heads. “The whole game was very mental,” Mabil says. “That few weeks was the most mental challenge I’ve had as a player, given what was on the line. Some were against us, a lot of the media saying we’re not going to make it. Peru thought: ‘Australia, who’s Australia?’, that it was an easy game, which gave us an advantage. Afterwards that you think about what Andrew did and think ‘shit, that was hilarious.’ They made fun of it in Peru, there are memes of him as a bullfighter. But, hey, it worked!”',\n",

       "  '“I don’t think people realise how hard it is, especially with Corona [coronavirus]: we played maybe 20 games and only three or four at home. Isolated, unable to get out. European teams travel two hours and go two days before. A lot of our players are overseas so it’s a 24 hour journey: fly today, get there tomorrow, as soon as you’re off the plane, train. Your body clock’s messed up and other countries make it difficult, delaying you at the airport, giving you bad training pitches ...”',\n",

       "  '“That makes you stronger. We broke the record – 11 wins running. Us Australians are better the hard way, backs against the wall. This group is special, the circumstances made us stick together even more. Especially when everybody was saying ‘they won’t make it, they’re one of the worst Australian sides we’ve seen’. That’s just people talking, and it’s not true – if anything, we’re one of the best.”',\n",
       "  'They’ll have to be: the world champions await, alongside Denmark and Tunisia. But that, says Mabil, “is how we like it.” There’s an edge to his analysis, a determination: that other journey again. It’s about respect, he says.',\n",
       "  '“We don’t have that yet. Come to Europe and South Americans are regarded as Gods because football’s their sport. There are a lot of Australians who are better than South Americans or Europeans but just get judged differently. It’s like me coming here: ‘Australian?!’ Get on the field and they’re like: ‘oh, you don’t play like an Australian.’ And I ask: ‘how should an Australian play?’ They think an Australian doesn’t dribble, do skills, play football. When you start expressing your football, they’re like ‘oh shit’. That image will change. It’s only a matter of time.”',\n",
       "  '“We have high expectations,” Mabil insists. “Australia reaching a World Cup is almost ‘normal’ now although it’s been a while since we won a game there. But we’re not satisfied just to be there; we want to produce great performances, reach the next round. That’s our target. Our dream is last eight or last 16: a powerful statement for our next generation. Football is No 1 now in Australia for kids’ [participation] and the further we go, the more it helps that grow, and when you engage in sport you automatically have a better society.”',\n",
       "  '“It’s not just winning games, it’s the impact: I know the impact it had on me in Adelaide, watching 2006. It rolls on like a snowball. The targets aren’t just for us.

       "  'Talking to female supporters before the match was not easy. Requests to talk were politely turned down and business cards offering the opportunity to talk later – just about the football – were returned. One woman, wearing the niqab, agreed to speak. Her name was Aliya, it was her first time watching her national side and she was optimistic: “Inshallah we will win.” She said she was excited about being part of the experience: “I am looking forward to the cheering and the people in there, the whole experience”. Her husband took over. “This is the World Cup – this is what it means,” he said. “Saudi will go to the next stage, we will have female teams and a female league. Our new president supports everything and ladies come first.”',\n",
       "  'The president of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation is Yasser al-Misehal, a former chair of the Saudi men’s professional league and a member of Fifa’s disciplinary committee. It is true he has presided over rapid change in the women’s game in the country. Two years ago the Saudi Women’s Premier League was established, the first national competition for women’s club sides. Then, in the spring of this year, a potentially more momentous event occurred: a first international fixture, with Saudi Arabia women beating the Seychelles 2-0 in a friendly in Mauritius, the first step on a proposed pathway into the official Fifa classification.',\n",
       "  'The growth of the women’s game comes a decade after Saudi officials were lobbying Fifa to ban the wearing of the hijab in football, a measure that would prevent women from playing the game at all. Five years ago women were not allowed into stadiums as spectators, the ban eventually lifted in three venues at the beginning of 2018. That these changes have been made at the same time as Saudi looks to claim a more central role in the sporting world, and with a potential bid for the 2030 World Cup on the way, may not be a coincidence. But they are real.',\n",
       "  'A few minutes after I spoke to Aliya, Mariam Meshikhes walked past with her friend. Mariam lives in the east of Saudi Arabia, was attending her first match and wearing a replica Saudi away shirt and a light green hijab. It was fair to say she was not reluctant to talk about the experience.',\n",

       "  'What, Mariam was asked, did she think female football fans bring to a previously all-male crowd? “Well, civility, obviously,” she smiled. “Females are needed everywhere; we’re 50% of our country – more than 50% of our country, right? She’s an engineer, I’m a doctor so we’re already participating in our country. Now it’s amazing that we are able to participate in rooting for our country in the World Cup. And to attend when they are on a winning streak – inshallah – and hopefully they win and they have a very big chance to be the first qualifier to the 16th round, was just ... you have no idea ... this is the greatest day of my life.”',\n",

Now the Saudis face a final fixture against Mexico needing at least a point to qualify, and no doubt a stirring speech from their coach, Hervé Renard, will be forthcoming. But the stars of the Poland match were as much the Saudi crowd as the players and they will be out in force at the 88,966-capacity Lusail Stadium on Wednesday.

       "  'By his own admission, Jack Grealish has packed a lot of “stupid stuff” into his 27 years. The Miguel Almirón episode was surely a good example. Grealish was a little drunk and extremely euphoric (or perhaps it was the other way around) as he celebrated Manchester City’s Premier League title triumph last season and he was asked by his teammate Bernardo Silva to explain the final-day comeback win over Aston Villa.',\n",
       "  'Grealish being Grealish, he got carried away with one of his jokes and ended up performing a drive-by on Almirón, the Newcastle winger. One of the secrets, Grealish said on a video shared on social media, was to substitute Riyad Mahrez because “he played like Almirón”. “Do you know what?” Grealish says from England’s World Cup training base in Al Wakrah. “I haven’t actually been asked about that and let me just address it.”',\n",
       "  'And so Grealish does. He makes the point that he had been drinking but, really, there was no excuse. He regrets it and he is sorry. Grealish says that he reached out to the Newcastle defender Matt Targett, with whom he played at Villa, to ask whether he could pass on an apology to Almirón. “Matt just said: ‘Jack, he’s a lovely kid, he’s harmless and he doesn’t speak a lot of English … he won’t really be bothered,’” Grealish says. “I didn’t want to reply [to Almirón] on social media because you dig a bigger hole and I’ve been there with other stuff.”',\n",

Almirón, who scored six goals during the period – he has eight for the season – said that Grealish’s comment had nothing to do with his stellar form. “Jack’s a great player first and foremost and I wish him all the best as I always do,” Almirón said.',\n",
       "  '“I thought: ‘What a guy,’” Grealish says. “Because if that was me and somebody had said that about me, I’d have probably been the other way and been like: ‘Fuck it.’ I didn’t realise it was a video to go out but even in private I shouldn’t have said it because he’s a fellow professional. I’ve had a lot of stick off the Newcastle fans and rightly so.',\n",
       "  '“I like to enjoy myself and I just go with the flow but I do some stupid stuff sometimes that I do regret. When I next play against him, I’ll show him the most respect because that’s what he’s done in a situation where he probably didn’t have to. I genuinely hope he does keep scoring – as long as those Newcastle fans stop messaging me.”',\n",
       "  'Grealish is asked whether he has put Almirón in his Fantasy Football team. “Nah, I don’t play that,” he replies. “Everyone loves it. I get about 100 messages every week saying: ‘Is [Erling] Haaland starting?’ It’s not really for me. I love my football but I can’t be arsed with it.”',\n",
       "  'Grealish is nothing if not open and honest. And if he veers off course, at times, his heart is in the right place. When he scored in England’s 6-2 win over Iran in the opening round of group games, he performed a wavy-armed celebration in tribute to a young City fan he had met called Finlay, who has cerebral palsy. Grealish’s sister, Mollie, also has the condition.',\n",
       "  '“I don’t do that for any clout or whatever,” Grealish says. “I do that because that’s what I feel I’m good at sometimes. Because I can relate to it with my little sister. It’s nice for him [Finlay] because he’ll go back to school and probably be quite popular. It ended up being so nice and quite emotional.”',\n",
       "  'It is hard not to warm to Grealish as he holds court, keeping the tone light, at one point despairing at the union flag waistcoat that his dad, Kevin, has insisted on wearing to matches. Grealish is in Qatar to enjoy himself, to be himself, because that is the only way he knows and it is the key to who he is on the pitch – a player who wants to express himself without fear.',\n",
       "  'Grealish’s numbers have not been great since his £100m move from Villa to City in the summer of last year – seven goals, four assists in all competitions – and there is exasperation when he considers how such metrics are “all that people go on about now … so much more than they should.”',\n",
       "  'What Grealish wants people to recognise is courage on the ball and he brings up Silva, who he describes as probably the best player he has played with.

       "  'Grealish’s love of the game and the way that he cherishes the ball always shines through. It was stamped all over a recent video of him and his City and England teammate Phil Foden playing a game of long-distance no-bounce, their touches and volleys sumptuous.',\n",
       "  '“Luke Shaw said to me: ‘When I come away with England, you can tell who the City lads are,’” Grealish says. “He said: ‘You always have a ball, you always want a ball.’ We get that from being at City. At Villa, you’d be sitting there, [players] on their phones … then at City, you’re sitting there and balls are flying across the changing room, people playing two-touch.”',\n",

       "  'It may have an acronym akin to a reality show but Semi-Automated Offside Technology, or SAOT, was designed to quell drama rather than cause it. An extension to VAR, it was introduced to help reduce problems with one of the most contentious aspects of video-assisted refereeing: how to decide if a player is offside in the buildup to a goal. It will be in use at the World Cup in Qatar.',\n",
       "  'In a nutshell: artificial intelligence crunches location data to map the positions of players when a ball is kicked. If the AI adjudges that a player is offside, an alert is sent to the VAR showing the “kick point” of the ball and the line of offside. After manually checking that alert, the VAR official informs the referee and any on-field decision is amended accordingly.',\n",
       "  'A SAOT decision at the World Cup will be made using data sent from a sensor inside the ball, the Adidas Al Rihla, transmitting its location 500 times a second, alongside that of 12 tracking cameras around the stadium that follow both the ball and 29 different points on a player’s body (the cameras relay their information 50 times a second). The AI will also create a 3D graphic showing the line of offside and the position of players relative to it. That graphic will be generated after the decision is taken and shown to fans inside the stadium and on TV.',\n",

       "  'Law 11 of the football rulebook starts out clearly enough: a player is offside, it says, if “any part of the head, body or feet is nearer to the opponents’ goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent”. But there are qualifications that must be applied to that rule. For example: a player can be offside only in the opponent’s half of the field and cannot be offside if an opponent had deliberately touched the ball last. These qualifications are subject to further revisions, too. This season the rule-making body, Ifab, was forced to clarify what “deliberate” meant, an explanation that ran to 400 words.',\n",
       "  'Given its complexity it is not surprising the offside law has provided the greatest challenges for VAR. The basic setup has an official remotely assessing an incident by replaying video footage. Such limitations did not take long to manifest themselves after VAR’s introduction to the Premier League. Video footage often cannot capture the precise moment a ball is kicked, while offside lines were also determined manually. In the case of a high-stakes decision, where the difference between a goal or not is a matter of millimetres, such an approach instantly created the possibility for frustration. Perhaps more crucially, these decisions could take several minutes to be made.',\n",
       "  'SAOT came with the promise that it would be both more precise and quicker, cutting decision times from an average of 70 seconds to 25. Fifa’s head of refereeing, Pierluigi Collina, described SAOT as “faster and more accurate” and “offering better communication to fans”.',\n",

       "  \"Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\",\n",
       "  'While there is little controversy over the accuracy of decisions under SAOT, calls that judge a player offside by margins not visible in the stadium, or on the video screen, remain controversial with managers and supporters. The main issue with SAOT, however, remains the reason it was brought in in the first place: timing.',\n",
       "  'The Arab Cup passed smoothly but examples unearthed by the ESPN journalist Dale Johnson found delays of well over a minute and, in one instance, over two minutes in making calls on goals with potential offside incidents. This pattern has spilled over into the Champions League this season. Harry Kane had a winning goal ruled out against Sporting Lisbon because of the interpretation of a subclause of the offside law that took four minutes to make. There was also a lengthy delay in Liverpool v Napoli and controversy following an overturned Patrik Schick goal for Bayer Leverkusen against Club Brugge.',\n",
       "  'In the Kane example it is hard not to imagine that the delay was generated not so much by the technology than by the subsequent intervention of human beings whose job it was to apply the offside law in full. Human fallibility and/or subjectivity, alongside the complexity of rules that have been written by humans (handball being not far behind offside in this regard), remain the biggest hurdle to VAR working efficiently. Uefa notes, however, that offside decisions are taking on average 30 seconds less to complete in the Champions League than in this season’s Europa League, where basic VAR is still in operation.',\n",
       "  'In previous Fifa tournaments, namely the men’s World Cup of 2018 and the women’s of 2019, VAR managed to avoid taking centre stage, perhaps due to greater discretion being allowed to the officials on the pitch – something a lot of fans would like to see more consistently. If that is the case again in Qatar, the hope might yet be for the upside of correct decisions without the pain of soul-sapping delays.'],\n",

       "  '“I suppose you could see similarities [to Liverpool] in terms of getting so close and just failing at the last bit until we ended up winning,” Henderson says. “I don’t like to make comparisons with other teams, and especially club football, but I do feel like when you go through experiences together, especially good ones, but at the end you don’t get what you want, that can make you really stronger as a team.',\n",
       "  '“I keep my runners-up medals. Not many players get to cup finals so I’ll always respect the process of getting there. But when you just miss out on your dream then it can hurt a lot and that is what drives you to get better.”',\n",
       "  'First things first: Senegal. There is definitely a view in England that the team will beat the reigning African champions on Sunday and play a quarter-final against France, particularly as Henderson’s former Liverpool teammate Sadio Mané is out injured for Senegal.',\n",
       "  'It is absolutely not the view within the England camp. Henderson was a part of the squad at Euro 2016 when Iceland were supposed to be brushed aside in the last 16 en route to a quarter-final meeting with France. Everybody knows how that worked out. But the Iceland debacle is not why Henderson dismisses the threat of complacency. It is because of his laser-like focus, his battle-hardened realism.',\n",
       "  '“It won’t be a danger for us as a team,” Henderson says. “We can say they are missing Sadio Mané but they got into the knockout stages without him and they will be feeling confident. They are used to winning. We have just got to keep focused on what needs doing, not get too carried away, not look too far ahead.”',\n",
       "  'Henderson says that a sixth tournament appearance makes him feel “a little bit old”. Only three England players have previously done six on the spin – Sol Campbell, Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. But Henderson’s energy, as much as anything else, was the standout feature of his performance against Wales in the final group tie when he won his 72nd cap.',\n",
       "  'Will he start against Senegal? Or will it be Mason Mount? Gareth Southgate’s decision will shape the dynamics of the midfield and the manager knows what he can expect from Henderson. Selflessness, experience and relentless hard work.',\n",
       "  '“I try to cover a lot of ground,” Henderson says. “High-intensity runs to put pressure on the ball and runs off the ball when we’re trying to get in behind or get on the ball. I try to inject a bit of intensity.”',\n",
       "  'One final thought. Would Henderson volunteer if it went to penalties? He does not miss a beat. “Always,” he replies.'],\n",
