      "BLOCKS ['Arsenal’s winning run was ended in dramatic style at the Emirates while Brighton and Liverpool also produced a thriller', 'Manchester United’s second win against one of Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City, and first away win against any of the traditional top three, was significant. The 3-2 defeat of Arsenal at the Emirates spoke to a real shift in the resilience of Marc Skinner’s side. Having taken the lead, United’s collapse early in the second half, conceding twice, looked to be following a familiar pattern. Instead, in front of an impressive away end, United roared back to equalise and then win it in injury time. Skinner called it a full Manchester United performance. “Our job is to bring the women under that same banner of: we might go down but we’re never beaten,” he said. They were helped by some poor defending for Katie Zelem’s lethal set-pieces, which provided goals two and three, but there is little doubt that United, after a bruising 3-1 defeat to Chelsea, are serious contenders. SW', 'What a way to get your first #BarclaysWSL goal!@ArsenalWFC 🙌 pic.twitter.com/wgHYEVHZbs', 'Perhaps the biggest winners following Manchester United’s 3-2 defeat of Arsenal were Chelsea. Having beaten United 3-1 before the international break, the Blues pounced on the opportunity to go top of the table, albeit with an extra game played, with a 3-0 home win over Tottenham. Emma Hayes returned to the touchline following her emergency hysterectomy, but the team had gone unbeaten in her absence and, in many ways, transition in and out had been seamless. “There is often this sense that coaching has to be done from coaches to players,” she mused after. “Instead I want players to be coaches on the pitch. So Sam Kerr said to me that when she scored against Manchester United the other day – when her touch had been all over the place in maybe three or four subsequent moves –just before that Guro [Reiten] had told her ‘Sam, the next time the ball comes, turn and shoot.’ It just made me feel so confident.” SW', 'Still thinking about this strike from @erincuthbert_ 🤩#BarclaysWSL @ChelseaFCW pic.twitter.com/gXLsKiRmat', 'If you are looking for pure drama, a Brighton game is the place to be these days. A fortnight ago, they had clung on to victory in a nine-goal thriller. On Sunday, they surrendered a lead once more, leaving interim manager, Amy Merricks, lamenting her side’s tendency to concede. It was deja-vu as the Seagulls found themselves 3-1 up at the break. A capitulation followed, however, as Liverpool produced an inspired comeback. Despite a tough run of form, Matt Beard’s side have shown character and they took their opportunities with Shanice van de Sanden as the catalyst. The substitute pulled one back before providing the assist for a dramatic equaliser. Rachel Furness was the player of the hour, bravely diving in with her head – as she so often does – at a cross in the 91st minute to send her team home with a valuable point. SD', 'Liverpool equalise in extra-time 👀 What a goal from @RachelFurness10 🚀 #BarclaysWSL @LiverpoolFCW pic.twitter.com/Sy1lFLwvnn', 'When your luck is out in football, it really is out. An 87th-minute winner from West Ham’s Izzy Atkinson – her first goal for the club – struck a dagger through Leicester hearts. Having what looked an equaliser disallowed minutes later only added to the pain. The Foxes, propping up the table, produced a solid performance on Sunday against an out-of-sorts West Ham. For the most part, they were brave and compact, controlling possession and tenacious with it. Their inability to convert chances, however, made them pay once more. Before the game, Willie Kirk’s side had the lowest shot conversion rate in the league at 3.5% and that problem was highlighted in this encounter: they created 17 shots to West Ham’s eight but only managed three on target. Kirk was keen to emphasise the positives post-match but he will know how valuable even a point would have been. With Chelsea next things do not get any easier for this Leicester side as they try to find a way to turn their fortunes around.

On Sunday, at Villa Park, they took the lead in the seventh minute but once again defensive errors let them down and they ended up losing 3-1. It went wrong late in the first half with Rachel Daly being left unmarked to head in the equaliser. True, it was a superb header but she had far too much room to execute it. Daly then made it 2-1 from a corner and it could even have been 3-1 early in the second half but Kirsty Hanson missed a glorious oppotunity. The Reading goalkeeper, Jacqueline Burns, was then sent off for a challenge on Daly and the England international completed her hat-trick from the spot. Reading have conceded 17 goals in seven games; that ratio needs to improve if they are to avoid a relegation scrap. SR', 'The composure from @izzyatkinson_ 🧊#BarclaysWSL @westhamwomen pic.twitter.com/YUY3MyYNae', 'Striker Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw has become the linchpin of Manchester City’s team this season and scored another vital goal at the weekend, this one giving her side a 2-1 win at Everton. The goal, coming in the 49th minute from a rebound, was her eighth in the league this season and handed City their fifth consecutive WSL victory, ensuring they keep the pressure up on the top three. Shaw set up the other goal for her side but the City manager, Gareth Taylor, was at pains to point out her overall contribution. “She does so much more than score goals, the way she takes the hits as well as giving the hits out,” he told the BBC. “She’s also very strong and she’s looking a lot fitter. She’s found a rhythm now in knowing she’s the focal point of the team.” SR']\n",

      "BLOCKS ['The defender on playing for the club in her heart and learning of her heritage through representing the country of her grandfather', 'Right to her core, Ashleigh Plumptre is a Leicester City player. Growing up in Melton Mowbray, about a 30 minutes’ drive from the city, the 24-year-old defender played for the club’s centre of excellence from the age of eight to 14, having started playing a few years earlier for a local girls’ side.', '“I was one of those kids that just always wanted to be active,” Plumptre says. She recalls getting home from school, dropping off her bags before playing football outside until “my mum would say I had to be home for dinner”.', 'As a teenager she temporarily left her hometown club, where she would later sign her first professional contract. As Leicester’s senior women were relegated from the third tier in 2013, Plumptre was tempted by Birmingham, a founding member of the Women’s Super League, where she joined their under-17 squad. After that followed a brief period at Derby, before she joined Notts County, who were then a WSL side.', 'In 2016, Plumptre moved to the US on a scholarship at the University of Southern California, where she majored in human biology. Her college side won the National Championship that year and were invited to the White House. Of that time, she says: “It influenced so many things in my life, and not just football, I found out more about myself, what I’m passionate about.”', 'But her ambitions never strayed far from returning to Leicester. By this point, the club had risen through the ranks to the Championship. After graduating in 2019 and despite interest from a few WSL sides, Plumptre was set on Leicester. Her father, also her agent, approached the club directly. The deal she signed has since extended it until at least next June.', '“[It] meant a lot to me to sign for Leicester because it was the club I’ve always supported and I grew up here,” she says. “I felt valued here, and I felt like I had a purpose here in trying to bring success to the club.”', 'After joining, Plumptre played a key role in securing Leicester’s promotion to the WSL for the 2021-22 season. Money likely helped, too: her team went fully professional in August 2020, after it was bought by King Power. “All the investment … it showed in the players that we brought in, and [promotion] was everybody’s mindset from the beginning,” she says.', 'Football, though, is far more than just a sport to Plumptre. “I have to have a purpose in it,” she says. “I struggle just to play it.” Case in point: she is an ambassador for Menphys, a local charity supporting young people with disabilities, which has supported her brother, who is autistic. (Plumptre has two younger brothers and a sister, all half-siblings.)', 'It was also in this mindset that, during the coronavirus lockdowns, Plumptre began thinking more about her Nigerian heritage: her paternal grandfather was born in Lagos.', 'Soon, she was talking to her 12-year-old sister about it. “Even though we have the same dad, we both have a Nigerian dad and a white mum, she looks a little different to me and has experienced things in school that I never had,” she says. “Most people just assume that I’m white. I identify as being mixed heritage. But my sister … she identifies as being black.”', '“I felt a bit helpless in that,” she says of learning about her sister’s experiences. Plumptre had played for England’s youth squads, including at Under-23 level but this year switched her allegiance to Nigeria, making her official debut in February. She says: “That’s where I’m like: ‘OK, Nigeria would be good for me to do because then I can experience the culture more, I can come back and teach her about our heritage.’ That was the trigger for me.”', 'Sign up to Moving the Goalposts', 'Informative, passionate, entertaining. Sign up to our weekly round-up of women’s football now.', 'Having not visited Nigeria until last year, Plumptre has embraced playing for the west African country. “I love the culture, I honestly love everything about being in Nigeria,” she says. She has also “realised how lucky I’ve been to just have been born in this country, the opportunities that I’ve been blessed with”. She adds: “My Nigerian teammates, for example, they’ve worked so hard but sometimes they don’t get the same opportunities based upon the teams that they’re playing in, the lack of exposure that they have. It’s a privilege to play with them.” Next year, she hopes to make the squad to represent Nigeria at the World Cup.', 'Back at Leicester, Plumptre faces a turbulent season ahead. With her side having lost their first seven matches, a relegation battle looks likely. But after fighting off the drop last season, she’s hopeful. “We know how it feels and we know how to get out of it so ultimately everybody is pretty much keeping the faith,” she says. “We know we can get results.”', 'What else does she want to achieve? “I just want to have an impact by being myself, I don’t really know what that looks like yet,” she says. “I want to help people, that’s all.”', 'Get to know the players in England’s top flight better with our WSL player in focus series.

Chelsea women broke their home attendance record as they played at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2019. More than 40,000 supporters were at Emirates Stadium on Saturday evening.', 'Good attendances reached into the Championship too. Sheffield United Women drew a record crowd of 11,137 to Bramall Lane for their 2-0 defeat to London City Lionesses.', 'The question now is how to do this on a consistent basis, and turn fans from occasional day trippers to dedicated supporters who follow the WSL and its clubs week in, week out. As Manchester United manager Marc Skinner put it last week, getting \"brains on seats\".', 'Things are heading in the right direction. WSL average attendance in August 2020 was 3,092; in November 2022 it is 5,099. The aim is for 6,000 by 2024.', \"There are growing pains, however.

We have to be more ambitious for ourselves. Is it too cheap to watch women\\'s football? I think it is, especially for the top games.\"', \"As well as Manchester United on Saturday, Arsenal play their home Champions League matches at Emirates Stadium this season. While these games have drawn much lower crowds, they are ensuring the women's club game at England's biggest stadia is becoming normal.\", \"They also faced Tottenham at the men's ground earlier this campaign, winning 4-0 in September in front of a club record 47,367.\", 'Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall said of the Emirates: \"I think it\\'s one of our two homes. And from the time I\\'ve been here, we feel more and more that this is our home.\"', \"A notable addition for this weekend's big stadium matches was away ends. Usually WSL crowds are mixed, which can lead to a competitive atmosphere being nixed.\", \"There was no risk of this on Saturday night, as the Manchester United players celebrated wildly with their travelling fans following Alessia Russo's late winner.\", 'They then went straight to the fans at the final whistle, something Skinner said they made a point of doing rather than entering their usual full-time on-pitch conference.', 'He said of away ends after the match: \"Whether it\\'s concrete proof or not, if you give us away ends you will get a lot of fans through the door.

Thirteen clean sheets in the Women's Super League saw her clinch the Golden Glove for the 2021/22 campaign, before setting a new league record when she kept 10 successive clean sheets this calendar year.\", 'However, Zinsberger is at pains to point out that anything related to clean sheets is not only down to her, but the entire team playing their part. Putting the team first is something she continually refers to during the interview.', 'Ahead of Arsenal\\'s match against Manchester United live on Sky Sports, the 27-year-old said: \"At the moment I got the Golden Glove, we figured out we hadn\\'t won the title. How would you celebrate?', '\"At the end, it\\'s a really great achievement of an individual, but I don\\'t take it as an individual award because it doesn\\'t mean if I am getting a clean sheet, I have saved all the balls. No, you have to imagine that my 10 players in front of me are keeping the ball as far as possible so it\\'s actually a team achievement.', '\"It may be my name underneath it, but for me, it\\'s totally a team achievement. It\\'s how they put their bodies between the ball and the goal to defend as a unit and as Arsenal, you can see the passion.', '\"At the end, the more clean sheets you have, the possibility keeps improving to win the title and that\\'s where we want to go.

But we are there to win the big trophies and the little ones, they are part of the personality of the club as well. But we want to win the big ones and if we add on the little ones, we nailed it.\"', 'But a clean-sheet record is just the tip of the iceberg for Arsenal this season. They currently sit top of the WSL - level on points with Chelsea, but with a game in hand - and have set a new record for record consecutive league victories. They have won each of their last 14 games.', '\"It\\'s an incredible team achievement,\" Zinsberger reflected. \"Everyone thinks about scoring goals, but first of all, keep the zero, be compact.', '\"It\\'s so much about little things and I think with injuries and so on, you have to compromise so many things, but we have to put the team first and that\\'s the most important thing.', '\"How we defend on the pitch is like putting our passion in it and how we score, there are so many different ones. It\\'s not only one [scorer], it\\'s the team and that\\'s what I love to see. We score as a team and we defend as a team.', '\"It\\'s about the little things, like your running back, and also in the 80th minute, to try and defend even when you\\'re leading 4-0. It\\'s about taking the last whistle of the ref, then you can take a deep breath and relax.', '\"But before that, we are putting everything in for Arsenal and that\\'s what I love to see and hopefully, we can keep progressing in the next couple of games.\"', \"One of Arsenal's standout performances this season actually came in the Champions League, when they beat eight-time winners Lyon 5-1 in their first group-stage match - a landmark victory that came on Zinsberger's 27th birthday.\", 'She said: \"I was shocked in a positive way. I was always believing in us, I knew it would be possible, but it would be tough against Lyon, who are such a great team.', '\"Just seeing the performance of the team progressing from minute to minute then scoring one, scoring two, then conceding one but still keep going. It didn\\'t impress us that they scored. We knew they were going to be brilliant at corners and free-kicks - they have such tall women in their team, of course they\\'re going to be good. But just watching the team push forward, but still defending with all we have was amazing.', '\"It was my birthday as well and Caitlin Foord, I have her jersey. She wears the No 19 and it was on October 19 and she scored the opening goal. Suddenly, in the game, I thought \\'that\\'s it\\' - not in the way that we should stop, but to keep going [after the first goal].', '\"So my birthday was hilarious, I couldn\\'t imagine winning 5-1 at Lyon.\"', \"It's not just Arsenal where Zinsberger shines. She is also No 1 for Austria, where she grew up in a small village 'of around 350 people', she estimates.\", 'Actually, the 27-year-old followed in the footsteps of her dad, who also played as a goalkeeper - apologising to him after joking that he was not as good as she is. Like female footballers in the UK, she grew up playing with boys in Austria, and a lack of goalkeeper on her team as a youngster saw her rotate into the position.', 'However, it did not prove to be a popular choice with her parents, although they have of course since become her biggest supporters and cheerleaders.', '\"I found out about my talent with football quite late, I was an outfield player at the beginning,\" she recalled.', '\"I most likely played with boys, kicking a ball around in a small village and just having fun. Once, we were just playing on a soccer field and one of the mums said they had to leave for training and I was left out.', '\"She said \\'why are you not joining? Come with me, have a look and if you want to try it out, you can\\'. When we arrived there, the boys started practising and I was sitting with the mum on the bench and she said \\'are you not interested to just try it out\\' and I wanted to.', '\"After the training session, I had my little piece of paper [consent form] which you need to sign. My mum was not happy about it because she had two girls and one was playing football. But at the end, she was happy that I\\'d done it and she signed the paper.', '\"I was an outfield player until I was nine and then the goalkeeper had to leave the club because of his parents\\' job so the coach said \\'if no one is in goal, we can\\'t play\\'. So at the beginning, we just swapped so I went in goal and then I started to like it. I liked the balance between being the hero and being the \\'boo man\\' or \\'boo woman\\'.', '\"My dad wasn\\'t happy about it, he said \\'you have so much talent being an outfield player\\'. Then we had a small test on the asphalt, and we stood face to face and he said \\'fall on your right side\\' and I did it because your dad is saying it.', '\"There was no grass and I stood up and then did it on the other side. Then he was like \\'OK, I\\'m fine, you can be a goalkeeper\\'.', '\"I was running to my mum saying \\'dad is going crazy, I had to fall down with no grass and I had no protection\\' and she asked him what he was doing. He said \\'I was making sure she was falling in the right way otherwise she\\'s going to get hurt and that\\'s definitely what we do not want to happen\\'.', '\"Since that time, he\\'s been the best supporter and the best family I could ever imagine to have.\"', 'Now in her fourth season at Arsenal, Zinsberger is proving to be one of the best goalkeepers in the WSL. She feels that her calming presence behind the defence can help them do their job, and despite vast development since arriving from Bayern Munich in 2019, is still targeting improvements.', '\"It\\'s about my presence on the pitch,\" Zinsberger said. \"I\\'m giving the team calmness, I communicate with my defence as much as possible, how do we go on goal kicks, taking responsibility, trying to step up in hard situations in the game, like taking crosses. There, you can show in actions that you are taking responsibility.', '\"I have grown and sometimes I\\'m a quiet leader and not talking that much, sometimes I\\'m just trying to read my players and figure out how they are doing and what we can take out of any situation.', '\"I think it\\'s also about my footwork. I\\'m trying to be active and help them, I\\'m not trying to hide myself, I\\'m there like \\'you need me, I need you so we have to keep working together\\', so I think it\\'s a mix of all of them. You need a real presence behind the team so they don\\'t have to look back, they know they have a strong goalkeeper without even looking. That is what I\\'ve shown to them in the last few years and the team needs someone they can trust without looking.', 'Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player', '', '\"When I joined Arsenal, I didn\\'t even think about how much potential was left in myself. It\\'s not even about being a football player on the pitch, it\\'s also about the physical part, the psychology part, the personality, the mental health, the nutrition.', '\"I made a plan for myself of how do I get better as quickly as possible, but still being patient. So I took my boxes and had one for \\'football\\', \\'mental health and \\'nutrition\\' and got better and that made me the person I am today.', '\"It\\'s been incredible and I\\'m really happy with how my development has gone at Arsenal, but I\\'m still trying to work hard and I\\'m not done. I want to go until the end with Arsenal and we will see at the end of the season how my fourth year has been and we can summarise it in a better way.', '\"Other than that, I\\'m quite satisfied - could have won more titles, but at least I got one, but at the end of the season, I might have another one.\"', \"This weekend sees Arsenal return to the Emirates Stadium as they take on Manchester United in the WSL, live on Sky Sports. The club's hierarchy is making a concerted effort to play more women's games at the men's ground - all of their Champions League group games are being played at the Emirates.\", 'For Zinsberger, she enjoys any opportunity to visit the impressive stadium, saying: \"I love the Emirates Stadium. I love it. I really love watching [football] there and also playing on the pitch.', '\"It\\'s still mind-blowing. I could never have imagined I would play at the Emirates. It\\'s still a great achievement and a great appreciation of the club as well that we can keep pushing the women\\'s game forward so we can play as many games as possible at the Emirates.', '\"The atmosphere is great when it\\'s filled up with fans and having the 12th player on the pitch. I can\\'t wait to play on the pitch again and more often.\"', 'Man Utd have kept pace with the Gunners for much of the season, although defeat to Chelsea before the international break sees them sit three points behind in third place. Man Utd will have a point to prove as they look to be true title contenders this season, and Zinsberger is not underestimating the challenge.', '\"They have done great since the beginning of the season,\" she said of this weekend\\'s opponents. \"Never underestimate Manchester United, the whole team, it\\'s impressive what they have achieved, how they work against the ball, with the ball.', '\"Mary Earps, she has kept as many clean sheets as I have and she is having a great performance since the Euros, and also before, plus the team has done great. It\\'ll be a really good game at the Emirates, and it\\'s pushing the women\\'s game forward.', 'Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player', '', '\"But I don\\'t want to focus too much on Man United. I\\'m not going to underestimate them, but it\\'s about us. I can\\'t influence Man United, I can only influence my part in the game, with the team, but also as individuals.', '\"So we have to work hard, putting our [Arsenal] badge in front and saying we are working together, doing our things right and if we\\'re doing that, Man Utd are going to be tough. But if we are doing our things right, hopefully I can keep a clean sheet and we are going to win the game, but it definitely won\\'t be easy.', '\"But this is the game you are waiting for and especially having it at Emirates, it makes it such a great environment. It\\'s a great atmosphere, so many fans can come and watch and it\\'s the next step of keeping women\\'s football going. It\\'s a great game on Saturday and everyone should come and watch!\"', 'Super 6 is going International! Could you win £100,000 for free?

      "BLOCKS ['\\nEngland’s win led to a flood of interest, but below the elite level, the game is battling\\n', 'England’s Euros triumph at Wembley this summer provided a once-in-a generation chance to grow the women’s game. Four months on, the signs are that interest in women’s and girls’ football is continuing to soar, amid a flurry of record attendances across the pyramid. However, scratch beneath the surface and it is clear more needs to be done, with many issues still to be resolved, not least around facilities and accessibility.', 'As the Government embarks on a review of the entire women’s game, chaired by England icon Karen Carney, we ask how the game can make the most of the surge in popularity.', 'Women’s Super League crowds have soared to an average of 6,227, including a new WSL-best turnout of 47,367 for September’s north London derby. On Sunday, Sheffield United obliterated the record for the Women’s Championship, the second tier, with 11,137 at Bramall Lane.', 'Kelly Chambers, manager of WSL club Reading, who play their home fixtures at the Select Car Leasing Stadium, which they share with Reading’s men, said: “All of us as clubs and the FA knew the biggest thing we wanted to try and change this year was getting [more] fans in the door and trying to build that fan base. It needs to keep growing.”', 'Two-thirds of top-flight teams are averaging more than 3,400 fans this term, and Arsenal have averaged nearly 24,000, thanks to playing two league games at the Emirates Stadium.', 'Speaking after her side’s loss to Chelsea in front of 38,350 at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, Tottehnam manager Rehanne Skinner said: “It’s great to have these one-off kind of hits but I think the most important thing is that everybody’s average attendance goes up, so still there’s a lot of work to do.”', 'After removing the “big-stadium” matches, the WSL is averaging 2,770 this season, above last season’s figure, which was below 2,000. Chelsea manager Emma Hayes – who says women’s football tickets are “too cheap” – believes WSL clubs are “all outgrowing our small stadiums”, with the 46-year-old adding that she would like to see teams playing between eight and 12 games per year at their men’s team’s home.', 'It is not just at the elite level where facilities are a key part of the discussion about how to grow the game. For some, access to a regular pitch of any kind is hard.', 'Bex Francis-Jones, a former captain of Manchester United Women, knows that feeling well. She is involved in the heartbeat of the grass-roots level, as both player and chairperson at Northwich Vixens LFC. The club are run entirely by volunteers – with even former Wales international Dean Saunders among those to have offered coaching services. The Cheshire club play in the North West Women’s Regional League Division One South, the sixth tier of the pyramid. Players pay to play – £20 per month, as well as a £30 signing-on-fee – but have their kit provided, thanks to local sponsors.', '“We’re always wanting to progress, we’re just struggling to grow any bigger because of a lack of facilities,” Francis-Jones says. “In Northwich, there aren’t enough facilities for the teams.”', 'Francis-Jones has been the club’s chair for around 10 years, and says extra interest since the Euros has enabled a new Wildcats – an FA participation scheme for five-to-11-year-old girls – group to set up in Northwich, and they have teams at all age groups.', 'Meanwhile, their first and development teams have pitch-access problems. The Vixens play their home matches in the neighbouring village of Lostock Gralam, sharing the men’s team’s venue, but Francis-Jones says: “It’s a grass pitch and the draining system is diabolical – it’s waterlogged quite often. Then there’s our training pitch – we train on a Wednesday night but only on half a pitch, around 40 players on half a pitch, from 8-10pm.\\xa0', 'It’s the only slot we can get, but the development team has 16-to-17-year-olds with college, A levels, and some travelling from Altrincham, and they need to leave by 9pm to get to bed to catch college buses at 6am.” She adds that – together with local men’s side Northwich Victoria – they are “actively looking” for land to build on and talking to the Cheshire FA. She adds: “We’re looking to grow a disability team and a walking football team, but we can’t because we haven’t got the facilities.”', 'Last year, when launching a new grass-roots strategy, the FA set a target of adding 5,000 pitches by 2024 and it is understood more than 3,000 have been built.', 'Another concern for many lower-league clubs is the one-up, one-down promotion and relegation system, with more than a dozen coaches from tiers three, four and five saying there are bottlenecks in the pyramid, with teams that want to invest unable to do so without promotion.', 'Fifth-tier Dulwich Hamlet are hosting Gillingham in the Women’s FA Cup second round on Sunday. Their head coach, Ryan Marvin Dempsey, says they have seen an increase in players contacting them for trials, but wants to see more funding trickling down to the grass roots and believes clubs should be rewarded for their investment. “Reshaping the pyramid needs to happen sooner rather than later to help growth,” he says.\\xa0', '“In our league, there’s only one team that can get promoted and you’ve got us, Millwall, Fulham, Worthing, Dartford that are putting a lot of infrastructure and support in and only one team can go up. It stunts growth. There are lots of ways you could do it. You could have two go up from each region, and then a play-off from the top two teams in the region.” The FA is understood to be reviewing the structure, including promotion and relegation.', 'Arguably the most important area. England named an entirely white squad of 23 for a friendly in 2021, and only around 10-15 per cent of WSL players represent black, Asian and minority ethnic communities compared with about a third in the Premier League. The issue is not just related to playing squads. Following former England manager Hope Powell’s resignation from Brighton, the managers at all 24 clubs across the top two English women’s divisions are white.', 'Former England and Arsenal striker Ian Wright says: “It’s a systemic problem and we are just dealing with it in incidents. We really need to start dealing with the systemic problem.”', 'The FA is increasing the number of centres of excellence – now known as “Emerging Talent Centres” – for girls’ football across the country to 70. The previous 30 centres were criticised for being predominantly in rural areas and hard to access from inner cities. The FA has also started an initiative called “Discover My Talent”, aiming to provide opportunities to girls from any communities to join the national pathway, and have had 1,622 referrals of school-age youngsters since July 2021.', 'There are shoots of growth but challenges remain.', 'Elsewhere, while big steps remain, shoots of growth are sprouting up around the country as careers in women’s football become more visible and attractive to young people, as Francis-Jones points out. “What the professional status of women’s football has also done is inspire some of our girls to become coaches and referees, because they’re seeing them out there now.”', 'That comes while on television – according to data released by the Women’s Sport Trust this month – WSL television audiences are 1½ times higher than last season, 42 per cent of new viewers are female and young audiences are rising, too.', 'That is partly why Tammy Parlour, the Women’s Sport Trust chief executive and co-founder, is optimistic that the game can thrive, but says it must not rest on its laurels. “I definitely feel that the success of the Euros [means] we’re entering this new era, but momentum is not guaranteed, there’s still lots that we need to do to drive progress and make sure we see those lasting changes and have an industry that is fully representative of society.”', 'We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.', 'We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.', 'Thank you for your support.', 'Need help?', 'Visit our adblocking instructions\\npage.']\n",

The last four, whom are still at the club and have all made bigger names for themselves by becoming nothing short of legends at Arsenal.', 'In July 2017, the club rebranded as Arsenal Women Football Club, in a move described by Arsenal as a “clear signal of togetherness and unity” to also help retain the progressive ethos of the club, utilised the core Losa helped build.', 'Losa’s time in charge also included bringing through youngsters with the quality of Leah Williamson, Charlie Devlin and Lauren James, and of course we all know Williamson is also another legend at the club.', 'All good things have to come to an end at some point though and Losa left Arsenal in October 2017, following a mixed start to that season.', 'But in would come another male in the form of Australian Joe Montemurro who had left current club at the time Melbourne City to join the Gunners.', 'On 14th March 2018 Montemurro won his first major trophy with Arsenal by beating Manchester City 1–0 to win the FA Women’s League Cup and two months later on 15th May, he led Arsenal to the Women’s FA Cup final in front of a record attendance of 45,423 at Wembley Stadium, but unfortunately, they lost 3–1 to Chelsea.', 'In the 2018–19 season, Arsenal under Montemurro, became the first FA WSL team to win nine games in a row, scoring a whopping 42 goals and conceding just five.', 'But again, the good times had to come to an end and with that so did the winning streak when an injury-stricken squad lost away to Manchester City.', 'Since his appointment though, it was clear to see that the attacking style and fluidity of possession instilled by Montemurro became noticed by all as he had won many accolades.', 'In February 2019 Montemurro became the first coach from the WSL to be nominated for Manager of the Year at the London Football Awards, alongside Maurizio Sarri and Mauricio Pochettino.', 'On 28th April 2019 in front of a record WSL crowd against Brighton & Hove Albion at the Falmer Stadium, goals from Vivianne Miedema, Katie McCabe, Beth Mead and Daniëlle van de Donk, secured the WSL title with games to spare.', 'This would be Arsenal’s first title since 2012. And as if that wasn’t enough, the season was also capped off with Montemurro winning the WSL League Managers Association (LMA) Coach of the Year and deservedly so, as he led the Gunners to their first WSL title in seven years.', 'The accolade nominations for Joe wouldn’t end their though as in July 2019, he was nominated as FIFA World Women’s Coach of the year and nominations for any manager regardless of what team they manage, is a big thing.', 'Arsenal pretty much picked up where they left off in the 2019–20 season as they qualified for the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League and the team was also part of another record-breaking WSL attendance, when 38,200 spectators came to watch the first ever North London Derby at Tottenham’s Stadium in November 2019 in which Arsenal won the match 2–0. NORTH LONDON IS ALWAYS RED!!!', 'Yet another record was broken one month later, when the women beat Bristol 11–1 at Meadow Park, the highest winning margin in the WSL.', 'That would be the end of the records and the accolades though as in March 2021, it was announced that Joe was to leave the club at the end of the season. Although he had the full support of the Arsenal board, Montemurro decided to leave the club in order to take a break and spend more time with his family, however it would be revealed not long after, that he was to go to Italy to become head coach of the Juventus women.', 'Joe left the club in a good place, as he saw them qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Women’s Champions League, with a couple of trophies in the cabinet for his troubles, but he managed to get them back where they longed to be.', 'Three months after Montemurro’ s departure, in the midst of a worldwide pandemic as well, the club appointed current manager Jonas Eidevall, and in June 2021 he was confirmed as head coach for the club. He is yet to win a trophy at the helm however this season especially, it is clear to see the work rate of the team and the improvements he has made with his coaching.', 'Under Eidevall the women have broken some records already. All this season when they smashed the WSL attendance record during the NLD at the Emirates after 47,367 watched Arsenal beat Tottenham yet again, with a 4-0 score line. They also broke the record for accumulating 10 clean sheets in a row and 14 straight wins in a row before losing, unluckily may I add, 3-2 to Manchester United at the Emirates.', 'Arsenal have also spent well in recent transfer windows, bringing in the likes of Stina Blackstenius and Rafaelle Souza to name a few. Even more so under Eidevall’s tenure, Beth Mead has become a world class player, to those who knew her before she was always one, but over the last two seasons she has become a legend to many an Arsenal fan, also lifting the Women’s Euros title after England’s win over Germany in the summer of 2022. And with the club playing as well as they are this season, surely it will only be a matter of time before they lift the WSL trophy again. We hope…', 'Although I have given a history of the managers of the club and the honours they have won, and as we know Arsenal women have had more than their fair share of managers over the years all with mixed results, there was only ever one legend of a manager for the women’s side to date, that of Vic Akers.', 'In 2018 ex Arsenal manager and legend, Monsieur Arsène Wenger said of Vic Akers: “It is absolutely unbelievable what he did. Unfortunately, he did it at a time where women’s football was not popular or rated so much. I am convinced he is a real football connoisseur, who has the instinct of managing, and I think with time he will get the recognition he deserves. The women’s game would be nowhere near where it is today if it was not for him.”', 'And that comes from one legend to another and I couldn’t have put it better myself.', 'Arsenal are statistically the most successful club in English women’s football, holding the records for most titles won in each domestic competition they have played in.', 'The club has won 15 league titles, 14 Women’s FA Cups, five Women’s League Cups, 10 Women’s National League Cups, five Women’s FA Community Shields, and are the only English club to win the UEFA Women’s Champions League to date.', 'They are also the only English club to win the continental treble while going undefeated in all competitions played that same season and in addition to that, in the 2006–07 season, the club became the first in the history of women’s football to achieve the continental European sextuple.', 'So, it is with a big thanks to Vic Akers who became the club’s first, longest-serving, and most successful manager that the women’s team had that the club is where it is.', 'He made the club what it is today and not just that, he put women’s football on the map and although it is a shame it took so long for it to be recognised and although there is a lot more work that needs to be done to get it to the level of the men, me as a football fan in general, and Vic too no doubt, will be and can be proud to see the beautiful game for both the men and the women, be where it is now.', 'Women’s football is more recognised and, in some aspects, more respected than it ever used to be and even though there is a lot more work to be done as I have said, none of this would have happened and neither Arsenal women nor women’s football would have been as successful as it is now if Vic didn’t dedicate everything he had to the cause of building something special.', 'And so, for that, Mr Akers, we will be forever grateful for what you created and what you have left behind, and here is to many more years of success and even more recognition for the women’s game, and for Arsenal women in particular!', 'Heres hoping hey Gooners!', 'Shenel Osman', '@sh3n3l_', 'Your email address will not be published.

Manchester United were top of the WSL until losing to Chelsea 3-1 two weeks ago, but this still represents Arsenal’s toughest test so far in the domestic campaign. ', 'Arsenal went top of the league with a 4-0 win against Leicester before the international break, and are ahead of Chelsea on goal difference, with Chelsea having played a game more. But matches after international breaks have tended to be tricky for Jonas Eidevall’s side, with players coming back from all over the world, as well as different playing styles. After the last international break, Arsenal squeaked out a 1-0 win against Reading, who are second bottom, and Arsenal lost at home to Chelsea in the Women’s FA Cup semi-final last season following an international break. ', 'Manchester United finished outside of the Champions League places last season, and then sold Jackie Groenen right before the beginning of the campaign. Yet, they find themselves in a better position than this time last year, having not conceded a goal until the 3-1 loss against Chelsea. With Mary Earps, Ella Toone and Alessia Russo now European champions, along with Nikita Parris, who joined of course from Arsenal, United have plenty of big game experience. ', 'United also have a fairly settled side: a back four of Maya Le Tissier, Maria Thorrisdottir, Millie Turner, and Hannah Blundell, who inverts at left back, and a midfield of Hayley Ladd and Katie Zelem, who hold behind Toone. United, who scored twice against Arsenal last season with set pieces that found Alessa Russo’s head, are strong on crosses and set pieces. United have had more possession in all of their matches so far this season, which could be something Arsenal look to expose on Saturday: are United a good defensive side, or were they just a good defensive side against teams worse than them? ', 'Arsenal come into the match with still a litany of injuries, especially in midfield and defence.

We need to prepare very well now for Leicester and if you want to win something in football, if that’s a trophy or if that’s beating a record, it all starts with performances and that’s what we need to focus on.\\xa0', 'When Arsenal met Leicester in the previous 2021/22 season they won both games easily with a 4-0 win for Arsenal in December 2021 and a 5-0 win for Arsenal in April 2022.\\xa0 Jonas lets us know what he´s expecting from Leicester this weekend…\\xa0', 'What I have seen from Leicester before was a very, very organised and structured team who are very hard working. When we look at underlying numbers, it’s one of the best defensive teams in the whole league.\\xa0', 'We’ve seen that in the recent games against Manchester United and Reading that they are a very hard team to break down. So we’re prepared to have to be very good on the ball to be able to create enough scoring opportunities to win.\\xa0', 'The BBC reported on Wednesday that Leicester manager Lydia Bedford has stepped down as manager, with director of women’s football Willie Kirk taking over the Women’s Super League side.\\xa0', ' Here are Jonas’ thoughts on how Leicester’s sudden managerial change may affect our tactics…\\xa0', 'I was surprised to see that they changed manager. From the outside, when you just purely look at the results… I think we all know it’s a result-based business, so it’s not a surprise if you don’t win any games that you might change the coach. But I was surprised, given when you prep for playing them, I think Leicester were one of the better coached teams in the league. I think they look very well structured, with all players trying to make the most of that. So when we have been preparing for them, I think that I’ve seen a lot of development in that Leicester side.\\xa0\\xa0', 'So for me, I was very surprised when I got the news yesterday about it, and I I hope that Lydia, as a fellow coach, she can see that progress even if she didn’t get the reward from it, in terms of points. I think she has improved them performance wise.\\xa0', 'I think that’s the nature of the game. If I were giving any young coaches any advice, it would be to say that when your boss is also a head coach, that never usually leaves you a lot of margins in this game. So that’s something I would always be watching out for a little bit, being a head coach myself.\\xa0', 'Jonas on how our players prepare for that unknown quantity…\\xa0', 'That for us, is what we’re trying to build. I think one of the most underrated things when you speak about a team sport like football is the concept of team maturity. And team maturity is how many different situations can you deal with as a team, and you need to have time together to build that experience, but you also, of course, have to be effective with the time.\\xa0', 'So for us, we’re building that all the time; all the experience that we have either in games or what we try to recreate in training, it goes towards games like this. We can’t say what we are going to expect, so we have to trust the team maturity here to say ‘how many different situations and formations can we deal with?’ and hopefully that’s enough. But we need to be good.\\xa0\\xa0', 'Jonas on whether he will research Willie Kirk to see how Leicester might play…\\xa0', 'You’re thinking like a good coach right now! That’s what you do. You try to get all the information and you try to apply it for what his current environment, but that still doesn’t mean that you can predict the future, but you can have a good idea of what has been happening before.\\xa0', 'Are Arsenal considering goal difference or just purely focused on the win…\\xa0', 'I would never start with goal difference. Our mindset is that we need to be 100%, and we need to do that in every situation in every game. We should not let the score affect our effort, so that means even if we are losing, we should never give up. And if we are winning, we should always try and push and do our our very best.\\xa0', 'So by doing so, and by doing our best in every moment, that will ultimately leave us with the best possible outcome. So that’s the challenge. But each game starts nil-nil and we have to live from that moment and don’t think that we can jump ahead in our thoughts.\\xa0', 'Could Leicester have a ‘new manager bounce’…\\xa0', 'I don’t know to be honest, I think what the answer will be, and it’s a boring answer, is that when you’re playing against a team that is not that predictable, the maturity of the team will play a big role. That’s our ability to handle a lot of different situations and our processes during the game in order to deal with things if they need to change.\\xa0', 'So, I think if we’re comparing this game to, for example, Birmingham away, I’ll say something – it’s a measurement of our team maturity and how far we have come. And I trust our team that we are taking steps and we are developing. But we need to put all that into action in Sunday’s game.\\xa0', 'Leicester are currently bottom of the Women’s Super League table, having lost 5 out of 5 games this season and they finished one from the bottom of the league in the 2021/22 season.\\xa0 So last season and current season form would predict a score of 4/5-0 to Arsenal.\\xa0 ', 'What are your predictions?\\xa0', 'Michelle Maxwell\\xa0', 'Follow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!\\xa0', 'Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

We want to perform brilliantly, but we\\'re not always going to.\"', \"Indeed, what's all too often forgotten about Manchester United Women is that the team is just four years old and they played in the second division for their first season -- the only professional club in the Championship at the time. Compare them with an Arsenal team that was winning titles before some of the United players were even born, or a Chelsea team that have spent a decade with current manager Emma Hayes alone, or even a Manchester City team that was brought under the wing and enjoyed fast investment just eight years ago.\", \"In short, United have always been playing catch-up and quickly; where Arsenal, Chelsea and City could all grow into leagues that weren't fully professional, investing at their own pace, the Red Devils have tried to race to the front and stay there. As any decorated distance runner will tell you, it's about race management and not going too hard, too soon; the analogy gets a little murky when transposed onto football, but success is quite simply something that needs to be viewed in the long term.\", \"It takes time, too.

It was about the quality Chelsea could bring into the game, about the experience of those who've won the title multiple times; the game was a close [and sloppy] one but the result was a fair one.\", \"If there's one way to guarantee a reversal of fortunes, it's to get an ESPN journalist to write about them -- the Citizens have racked up four wins from four (in all competitions) with 14 goals scored and one conceded since someone on here rubbished them.\", 'The football has been steadily improving on the blue side of Manchester, too, but most of that is down to the way their forwards are combining. The best example of the flow between the attacking trio was their third goal against Reading over the weekend: the full integration of Bunny Shaw into the centre-forward role has been hugely profitable for a City team who never fail to create out wide.', \"That said, it shouldn't be news to anyone that Shaw has a tremendous scoring ability -- the Jamaica international is now up to 16 goals in 15 games in the WSL, including six games so far this term -- and it doesn't take a maths prodigy to tell you not all of those goals are from this season. Much like last year when City started putting results together, it was about the pre-existing partnerships and settled players doing the heavy lifting; this is the case again here, with the newer players to the team and league still looking for firm ground beneath their boots.\", '', 'The beautiful game lives here.

Against Liverpool, the hosts needed a strike from Hayley Raso 15 minutes from time to come away with all three points and against Reading, the match was all but decided by two own goals from the Royals before Shaw added a late third.\", \"The good news for City is the stickiest part of this season, when they'll face Chelsea and Arsenal the following week, isn't until the Spring, though the last two months will likely end up defining their campaign. By which time everyone should be settled, and the team should be playing their best football.\", 'Much like the two teams from Manchester, there\\'s something verging on \"box ticking\" from Chelsea going on this season. They\\'re a team with flashes of greatness, but often looking like they\\'re going through the motions.', 'It would be too simple to say that the team are simply missing Hayes in the dugout while she is away from the team following a hysterectomy. As she said in her statement, \"we have built a tremendous team over many years and we\\'ve adopted a very multi-disciplinary approach so that if situations like this arise, we are capable of being able to respond to the challenge. We have full confidence in Paul [Green], Denise [Reddy] and all of the staff. We also know the team are very special and we have no doubt they\\'ll do everything to maintain their high standards.\"', \"While it may be true that everyone at Chelsea is of the same ilk and that the combination of Green and Reddy is enough to keep the team ticking over, there is also something to be said for how much of a permanent fixture Hayes has been at Chelsea throughout their success, and how she has rarely been away from the sidelines. With the team not quite hitting the high notes they're capable of, that charismatic presence on the touchline could be what they're missing; it could also be simple growing pains that come with integrating new players or, more likely, a combination of factors.\", 'The Blues ran out 3-1 winners against Man United on a cold and largely forgettable day in Leigh to leapfrog their opposition, but the game was far from their -- or United\\'s -- best. Instead, it was littered with what we once would have called \"uncharacteristic errors,\" but errors that are creeping into their matches more and more. Other than a jaw-dropping 8-0 win over Vllaznia in the Champions League, Chelsea are yet to really show their quality on the pitch this season, rather they\\'re getting over the line in fixtures; taking three points without showing the calibre that has helped them win five WSL titles in the last seven years.', 'Finally, we come to the table toppers who have yet to take a misstep domestically or in Europe. Meet the leaders of the pack: Arsenal.', \"At the start of December 2021, less than six months into Jonas Eidevall's tenure as Arsenal manager, the team began to wobble, their football often grading on a sliding scale from shaky knees to full-blown earthquake. The team had finally hit a clear point of transition away from their old style, preached by former coach, Joe Montemurro, based on possession and smooth passing that enhanced the individuals in the team. Now, they're recognizable in Eidevall's more physically taxing style that boasts more rigidity and is about achieving wins through pressing and high tempo play.\", 'It was a clear struggle for the Gunners to say goodbye to the old and step into the new, but after a raft of uncomfortable games -- namely the ones in which Arsenal ultimately dropped enough points to allow Chelsea to spring beyond them and claim the title -- they finally settled. This season, the team has taken the next step, one of the rare few that took care of their key signings over the last winter window rather than the summer one; it ensured that by the start of this season, Stina Blackstenius and Rafaelle were already settled in England.', \"From the small technical players of the Montemurro era to the tall and built ones Eidevall favours -- save for the still-diminutive midfield -- Arsenal looks a world away from that of the team that won the title in 2018-19. It's a style that allows the players Eidevall has brought in, like Frida Maanum and Blackstenius to thrive, a team that's been fine-tuned to punish their opposition. There is no better example of this than their Champions League outing in Lyon, when they attacked with a near-perfect accuracy. This team is more of a battering ram than ever before, yet there is still that almost surgical touch and pin-point precision from Montemurro's time at the helm.\", \"The biggest concern for Arsenal, as it has been so historically, is injuries. Indeed, when the Gunners lifted their last title, they had to somewhat crawl over the finish line. This season, things aren't so grim (so far), yet they are without both starting centre-backs, forcing Eidevall to play full-back Steph Catley -- who was in flying form -- at the back with Lotte Wubben-Moy. It's an easy solution, but also one that clearly weakens the team in both attack and defence and potentially signals a crack in what looked like solid foundations.\", \"Six games (or seven if you're Chelsea) into the season, and so far it looks like the title won't be moving from London. Where in London is a different matter.\"]\n",

On day one, there was talk of the trophies, the Champions League and big-money transfers.\\xa0', 'But also on the agenda, was a commitment to supporting the women’s team. Chief executive Amanda Staveley outlined how the new owners were ‘wholeheartedly committed to women’s and girls football.’\\xa0', 'Amid the controversy of the Saudi-backed takeover, it was perhaps an easy win. A PR stunt, some may say. But as Sportsmail speaks to women’s head coach Becky Langley at the club’s Academy training centre, it is clear this is no vanity project.', \"Newcastle United's Saudi-backed takeover has led to new investment in the side's women's team, with Amanda Staveley particularly interested in their success\", '‘When the owners first came in, everyone was really excited but also a bit nervous of what that meant for everybody here,’ Langley says. ‘With being the richest club in the world, there was that element of doubt of are they just going to bring in a whole new staff team, a whole new player team? They can probably afford to buy Lucy Bronze!’', 'Staveley has taken an active role in supporting the women’s team. Last season she turned up unannounced at a game at Northumbria University’s Coach Lane Campus and was spotted peering through a fence trying to watch the action unfold. She has also attended every home game at Kingston Park this season.', '‘Amanda talks to myself and the players about how, when she was a young girl, she’d have loved to have played football but there wasn’t that opportunity for her,’ Langley says.\\xa0', '‘She’s really passionate about making sure that every girl in the area has the opportunity to play football and doesn’t have to pay to do so. There is a real genuine care about the women’s team, it isn’t a PR stunt, there’s no two ways about it. They show that in that they want to come and watch our fixtures.', 'Staveley has taken an active role at the club and attended every one of their home games this season', '‘They really want us to do well and I think Amanda is excited that we could be the first Newcastle team to win silverware if we go on to win this league, unless Eddie and the boys have a good experience in the Cup!’', 'It is not just Langley who is feeling the support of the ownership. Forward Katie Barker, age, is a life-long Newcastle fan. She was forced to play for Sunderland in her youth and went on to make her WSL debut for the Blackcats, but now there is a chance to progress at the club she loves.', '‘To finally be part of Newcastle United is amazing. It makes us feel cared for, recognised,’ Barker tells Sportsmail. ‘One day there will be a kid like me, a die-hard Newcastle fan growing up, and they won’t have to go and play for Sunderland. It’s amazing to know we’re impacting the young girls that come to watch us play.’', 'Previously players had to get a sponsor or pay a fee of £400 a year to fund kit, buses and equipment. While some players had the support of businesses and family, others had to pay by direct debit.\\xa0', \"The club's women's team drew a crowd of over 20,000 fans to St James' Park when they played Alnwick Town Ladies in May\", 'Money provided by the new ownership has relieved that burden and the team now train once a week at the men’s site in addition to their other two sessions a week. But there is an understanding that they must build in a sustainable way.', '‘What people need to remember is that the players are still part-time players,’ Langley says.', '‘Yes, they’ve got additional support services and they’ve got a little bit of financial support from the club, but we’ve still got players who are full-time students, we’ve still got players who are full-time police officers, players that are assistant head-teachers, we’ve got players that are still working a 50-60 hour week. The reality is they’re not full-time footballers which wouldn’t be right at this level currently.', '‘We’ve got the ambition and a long-term plan but our feet are on the ground in that we’re playing tier four football. Some of the teams we will play in our league will have really limited resources.’', \"Becky Langley's side normally play their home fixtures at Kingston Park, home of the Newcastle Falcons\", 'As it stands, Newcastle require three promotions to reach the Women’s Super League. They are second in the National League Division One North, one point behind Durham Cestria. But the club would be in a strong position to apply for a top flight licence should the FA decide to expand the league.', '‘I’m sure if that opportunity arises we’ll be pushing to see if we can in any way leapfrog the leagues,’ Langley says. ‘Of course we want to play at the highest level we can. But I think there’s also something quite special about starting in tier four and actually seeing it as a project to build.’', 'Langley’s side will play their second game at St James’ Park on Sunday, with over 25,000 tickets already sold. Their first fixtures at the men’s stadium on May 1 attracted a crowd of 22,134 but following England’s success at the Euros, there is hope that they can surpass the 47,367 attendance of north London derby.', '‘I think we’re all ambitious and really excited that if we push the game and advertise it in the right way and if we’ve got a good momentum of winning football games then people will want to see the product that is on offer,’ Langley says.\\xa0', \"But over 25,000 tickets have been sold at St James' for their clash with Bradford City W.F.C\", '‘We’d obviously love to beat that record and we’re all very aware of the great crowd that Arsenal and Tottenham got and we just want to surpass that hopefully.’', 'There is an accusation, on the men’s side, that Newcastle fans feel ‘entitled’ to success. That is not true. They just want to be able to dream, to have hope. Now, after years in the wilderness, the women’s team can dream too.', '‘We’re hungry for success,’ says Langley. ‘Without the support of our owners, we wouldn’t have the ambition to be in the WSL.

United expose Arsenal's weaknesses\", 'Still playing with an improvised backline following injuries to starting centre-back pair, Leah Williamson and Rafaelle, the Gunners had done well to weather most incoming attacking storms before this outing. Yet, once Leah Galton who has been digging down into some of her better form this season began to run at the usually unchallenged defensive line, the entire Arsenal team began to quake.', '- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)', \"Indeed, it was the visitors who enjoyed the better attacking spells during the first half as they stretched the play across the broad Emirates pitch that Jonas Eidevall's team usually relish playing on and had yet to be beaten on in the WSL, winning all four of their previous league matches played in N7.\", 'Even when Arsenal found their equaliser at the start of the second half to swing the match into their favour and help them build momentum, the fragility of their defence remained clear when United questioned its resolution. And with Manuela Zinsberger having a less than faultless day in goal, United trusted in themselves to keep going and indeed, find the moments of quality to see them come away with all three points.', \"2. Arsenal's stuttering style\", 'Coming into the tie on a 14-match winning run in the league -- a running WSL record -- the Gunners have looked like a team on a mission, with a razor-focus on all the silverware ahead of them. With the 2021-22 season bringing about a dearth of silverware -- a rarity for one of the most successful clubs in the country -- the runners up from last year have been attacking all matches with a belligerent ferocity, pressing their opposition hard and high, scoring for fun along the way.', \"Yet against Manchester United, that fluency between players was lacking, rapidly dissolving like a puddle on a hot day, leaving only the stain of a memory in its place. It was true that the 11 who started against United weren't necessarily the 11 who Eidevall would have picked out of choice, but rather were the best available to him based on form and fitness. So, it could be argued that the lack of week in week out familiarity in games was lacking yet, the team was the same that had started their last league game before the international break.\", \"Arsenal, as a team however, understand the way their manager wants them to play, nuances and tweaks for individual games aside, there is a clear and punishing style that the Swede preaches. However, without a player like Kim Little on the pitch to be able to get in and weight the midfield battle in the favour of the Gunners, the system begins to degrade and fail across the pitch. The absence of the Scot in such close games asks everyone on the pitch to find a better first touch, and get comfortable moving the ball at pace without losing the accuracy that is vital. Even with Maanum's goal acting as an accelerant to light the fire under the hosts and force a higher tempo, it was the accuracy and comfort with the ball that was still wanting from Arsenal.\", '3. United find a 90-minute performance', \"In their last match before the international break, United battled hard but ultimately came up short against current champions, Chelsea. It was a match riddled with mistakes from both but the difference on the night was Chelsea's ability to go to their bench and find the players to make the difference, to encourage those on the pitch to punish the mistakes when they happened, something the Red Devils could not do.\", 'In London, United fired out of the blocks and instead of playing a balanced match as they did against Chelsea, took the fight to the hosts. It was a bold strategy but one that paid dividends as they found the weaknesses in the Arsenal midfield and defence to exploit.', \"At 0-1 and 2-1, the complaint from United was easily that they didn't make the most of their first half chances. It looked as if they were going to leave with nothing after deserving something but it was being able to dig deep, to hold themselves firm in the face of Arsenal's attack and cut forward with enough power to keep creating that was the difference for them today.\", '', \"Again for Man United, it was Katie Zelem's critical dead-ball delivery that propelled them to victory with both second half goals coming from her crosses into the box, but they wouldn't have been a positivity if not for her teammates driving forward and working the defence and goalkeeper. Against Chelsea, it looked as if the gap was indeed closing but only minutely, and that United were still a long way from being able to mix it with the top two in England but at the Emirates, the Red Devils reached out and grabbed their opposition, dragging themselves up to their level, slamming the gap shut.

', 'The defining moment in this game came not with any of their goals, rather in a small but significant incident a couple of minutes into injury time. ', 'Neve Herron went in for a 50:50 with Demi Stokes just to the right of the Sunderland box. Both former Gateshead College players were fully committed, eyes only for the ball, and it was the youngster in red and white who came away with the ball. ', 'It felt symbolic, like the passing of a torch between generations.', 'Herron’s full range of talents were on show from the very outset and no doubt the eagle eyes of the City Group will have been keenly trained on the versatile youngster. ', 'She was nominally playing on the right of three central defenders but was everywhere - popping out of defence to break up play, clearing loose balls in the box, dashing down the wing to create counter attacks, crunching through multiple players in the last few minutes to ensure the scoreline remained respectable.', 'There were fleeting movements and moments in this game where we looked very much their equals. Had Brianna Westrup hit the net with her first half header from a corner, it could have been a very different game.', 'Man City’s quality and depth was pretty awesome to see up close and in person. Bunny Shaw is a wonderful footballer and when our defenders saw her name on the teamsheet, their hearts must have dropped.', 'Physically imposing but with a deftness of touch and an intelligent positional sense, the Jamaican centre forward was quite literally head and shoulders above anyone else on the pitch. When she latched onto Steph Houghton’s beautifully weighted through ball to make it three nil, all I could do was applaud. If you don’t appreciate that kind of quality, football’s not the game for you.', 'Sunderland’s forwards - Gears, Dodds and Manders - never stopped running, and the same goes for their replacements Grace Ede and Abby Holmes, but had a hard time getting any change from Alex Greenwood and Houghton and there were moments when our propensity to be careless in possession meant decent opportunities to break went to waste. ', 'As hard working a defensive display as this was from the Lasses, City hardly broke sweat for large portions of the game. The gulf between a side crammed with internationals and a group of women who will be back in work in their other jobs tomorrow morning was always there, only compensated for by the pure graft and organisation that Mel Reay and Steph Libbey have trained into their team.', 'The Manchester City Academy Stadium is a great place to watch football and the physical representation of a club that sees its female stars as an important part of its overall brand. ', 'Etihad’s greenwashing adverts scrolled around the perimeter advertising as the DJ tweaked nobs on her digital decks to get the pre-match atmosphere pumping. A HD neon screen showed the clock and a crystal clear PA announced the substitutions. The catering was spot on - Vegan Chickpea Curry Pie and a free cuppa. ', 'Everything was slick, professional and very much not a non-league experience. Abu Dhabi’s money has indeed created a world-class setup in all areas of the club.', 'But the lasting impression I’ll take from our visit is of a club whose fanbase consists of a much younger, much more female, much more diverse demographic than I’ve seen elsewhere on my travels in the last few seasons. ', 'Being situated in the heart of the East Manchester community, it there seemed to be a genuine connection between the players and the supporters. The 2,500 fans there were pretty noisy, and this was encouraged through the distribution of those god awful clackers. The chanting and singing, some very creative - “She’s big, she’s blue, she’ll eat a Kangaroo, Jill Scott, Jill Scott” - others were inexplicably North American (honestly, I didn’t think that “I believe that we will win” would ever migrate across the Atlantic, but each to their own), was really good to hear. ', 'The lack of an away end meant we had to sit amongst it and endure the wondering looks and tutting disapproval of those around us, which sometimes seemed to suggest they couldn’t comprehend why anyone would support a team that wasn’t guaranteed to win 80 per cent of their matches. ', 'What was also nice to see was the smattering of red and white throughout the stands - we saw a little girl with a Sunderland flag was there with her parents, I presume a family of exiles taking their kid to support their side. This is great, and one advantage of these Conti Cup ties is that a game against one of the big Manchester or Merseyside clubs is almost guaranteed every year. I hope it was a special and formative game for her despite the scoreline. ', 'For someone with a long memory, however, there was more than a tinge of jealously wrapped up in this away day. Until they won the ownership lottery in 2008, becoming the pioneering state-run club in English football, there was little to separate us in men’s or women’s football.', 'Even in 2010, they didn’t apply for the inaugural Women’s Super League - neither did we. But Man City have been an ever present in the WSL since 2012, when they joined the top flight despite Sunderland topping Tier 2. It was the money from the UAE that was decisive then, but you cannot question their commitment ever since. ', 'That many of Sunderland’s greatest ever female players made the impressive City campus their long term home is no surprise, and they wouldn’t have been the champions they are without the professional facilities and sustained investment on display at Eastlands. ', 'Yet I left the ground wondering if we’re about to see a similar exodus - Grace Ede is already on a dual contract with them, and, after this game, they’d be daft if they weren’t trying to prise Herron from us too.

', 'There were a lot of comings and goings last summer and we thought that a number of new players may need time to gel together. ', 'However, after an initial defeat at Aston Villa where we looked a bit sluggish, we’ve performed excellently and to be honest, we’re ahead of the curve of where I thought we’d be at this stage of the season.  ', 'Dave: Georgia Stanway, Lucy Bronze, Keira Walsh and Caroline Weir had all been fantastic at City, and when club legends Ellen White and Jill Scott both retired, of course that caused concern.', 'Gareth Taylor and his staff have recruited very well, however. ', 'They did not look to replace on a like-for-like basis, but players such as Laia Aleixandri, Deyna Castellanos, Leila Ouahabi, and Yui Hasegawa have come in and hit the ground running. ', 'I believe that we’ve recruited players to fit the style we want to play, and it’s worked very well over the early part of the season. ', 'There’s a mixture of potential and experience, and on the whole, they’ve performed fantastically.', 'Dave: City have built up some momentum since losing the first two games of the WSL season, which came on the back of an early Champions League exit to Real Madrid. ', 'The start of the season came after a successful summer with the Euros, and I honestly believe the lack of a pre-season was a factor. ', 'We weren’t at our best on the opening day, but the next game away to Chelsea was an excellent performance and if we’re honest, a 0-2 defeat was extremely harsh. ', 'Since then, the momentum and confidence has seemingly grown as our ‘new’ team has turned in excellent performances week in and week out. ', 'Dave: I think City will field a mixture of players who need vital minutes, along with some of our promising younger players. ', 'Experienced players such as Steph Houghton, Demi Stokes and Filippa Angeldahl are all short of match time, along with Ruby Mace who is on the verge of returning from injury, and I expect all of them to start, fitness permitting.', 'Alanna Kennedy has also yet to feature due to injury and her international teammate Hayley Raso was also absent last week at Everton. If fit, they may well feature.  ', 'Against Blackburn, we put a number of academy prospects on the bench, so this may well be the way we play on Sunday, as Gareth Taylor rotates his squad to keep everyone fresh and match fit ahead of a busy run of games leading into the Christmas period.', 'Dave: City are equally focused on every game, regardless of the competition.  ', 'We’re the proud holders of the Conti Cup and have won the trophy four times since we turned professional in 2014, including an amazing triumph in our debut season.  ', 'This trophy has a very special place in the hearts of the club and the supporters. ', 'We finished third in the league last season, as well as winning the Conti Cup and finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in an amazing FA Cup final, so we do approach every single challenge with an equal will to win.', 'Dave: To be honest, most of the new players I’ve already mentioned could be considered as having a ‘breakout season’.  ', 'Rather than repeat that, I’ll mention a player who was already at the club and who’s almost become the first name on the team sheet for league games.  ', 'Esme Morgan has been at City since she was young. She worked her way up through the academy and after a year on loan at Everton, and then a horrific injury which kept her out for a year, she’s been fantastic at the heart of our defence this season.

It has turbo charged our strategy with demand growing right across the game.', 'Another big goal was our pledge to transform the game at the grassroots level by ensuring that girls have equal access to football in schools and clubs. It’s a passion shared by our special group of England players, who are doing everything in their power to make change in this area. Our strategy sought to achieve this goal by 2024 but we know that we must capitalise on the Euros and work in partnership with government and other key stakeholders to drive this ambition as quickly as possible. The reality is we haven’t got strong PE in schools policy from the government, she stressed.', 'It sits at the heart of pretty much everything else we’re talking about, if you don’t get girls the experience of playing the game. There’s money in the system, but not the policy that says this matters.', 'PE and school sport isn’t ‘nice to do’, it’s ‘need to do’. This isn’t something that on a rainy day you can abandon and do a little bit more reading. It’s about the people standing on platforms and saying this matters. And yes, we’d like a piece of that for football please.', '(Arsenal`s) Leah (Williamson) and Lotte (Wubben-Moy’s)’s letter, which was sent to Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss said we don’t want the legacy to just be our win at Wembley, we want our legacy to be that we’re giving young girls the opportunity to play our game.

It’s the biggest issue for every sport, not just the biggest issue for football.', 'So, we are a few months on from the Lionesses’ Euro triumph and I think we can all feel the uplift in interest in women’s football on a number of levels, not least of all with more and more women’s games being played at major stadiums, being televised, and record attendance levels but the key question here is:', 'What is the government actually doing about it?\\xa0 To be fair, UK Prime Ministers seem to have been going through a bit of a revolving door with 6 in the top job over the last 5 years.\\xa0 What are the chances really of getting policies to stick amidst that turmoil at the top?', 'We think Sue Campbell and Arsenal’s Lotte Wubben-Moy (the originator of this issue) have an upward battle on their hands.\\xa0 The momentum and the drive for change are there within society and within the game at all levels so what will it take to get the government on board?\\xa0 We appreciate the current incumbent in the top job may have one or two other pressing issues but all we need is a Policy that says this matters..', 'Your thoughts appreciated..', 'Michelle Maxwell', 'Follow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Women’s Team!', 'Do you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

', 'Darren Bent had grabbed the goal, supported in a hard-working midfield by the likes of Steed Malbranque, Kieran Richardson, and Lorik Cana.', 'We also had a young Jordan Henderson in the men’s side, and there was also another future England international named Jordan - Jordan Nobbs - who was making waves on the Lasses side of the club too.', 'Having gone all the way to the FA Cup Final that spring and given Arsenal - the dominant side of the time who had only lost once in six years - a hell of a fright in a 2-1 defeat, we had been promoted to the Women’s National Premier League 1, the top tier, and Sunderland Women looked set to become a real established force. ', 'The season had gotten off to a good start, with our only league defeats coming against Forest, Jill Scott’s Everton, and the Chelsea side we’d vanquished at the Stadium of Light in the Semi Final of the cup. ', 'And so the week before, Sunderland Women had travelled south to play the Gunners and come away with a goal - but we conceded five in return. Historically, this would have been seen as a pretty decent result, given the gulf in resources between the two set-ups.', 'But at Eppleton that day, with Arsene Wenger’s side having been sent back down the A1 with their tails between their legs, Mick Mulhern’s women managed what had for many years seemed almost impossible, and grabbed all three points. ', 'The Sunderland starting lineup included Nobbs, Demi Stokes, Lucy Staniforth, Kelly McDougall, Rachel Laws, and Abby Holmes. Arsenal’s side read like a roll-call of the greatest names in the history of the game - Katie Chapman, Jayne Ludlow, Rachel Yankie, Gilly Flaherty... it was some team. ', 'We managed to get to 0-0 at half-time, but then the legendary Scottish forward Kim Little scored her 23rd goal of the season, latching onto a Julie Fleeting pass to round Laws and score. ', 'Four minutes later, however, Sunderland were level through Stockton’s finest export, Nobbs, with Sophie Williams getting the assist. It set up a barn-storming finish to the game, with both sides pressing for the winner. ', 'And it was Nobbs who was decisive, crossing for Scoucer McDougall to score the winner with only a few minutes left on the clock. It was a monumental moment, a stand-out result in our club’s history, and to that point the greatest victory this young side had achieved.', 'With two wins against the Londoners in two days, it was a brilliant weekend. Reflecting on the result in an interview with Roker Report - The Lasses Podcast earlier this year, defender Gemma Wilson, told the story of that season and this result in particular. ', 'I think that was their only defeat that year in the league, and only the second time they lost domestically in six years - they had an amazing, amazing side.', 'Them coming up here and us looking for a result, looking to come out with three points, it was a massive change in mentality and culture within the club. ', 'We knew and we trusted who was in front of us, who was behind us, who was alongside us. You knew that if you made a mistake, you had two or three players who were there to pick it up, and we had that core through the spine of the team with experience, then we had the youth and the flare around us as well, and it was just an amazing, amazing year. ', 'We followed up this great victory with a 2-0 win over Chelsea, who we’d vanquished in the FA Cup Semi-Final at the Stadium of Light. We finished the season in fifth, winning 12 of the 24 league games we played. ', 'But the club’s lack of wholehearted support for the Lasses, not for the last time, would stand in the way of their continued progress. The club’s application to join the new and exclusive Women’s Super League was unsuccessful, and a generation of players moved on to bigger and better things. ', 'Nobbs had made her mark on Arsenal, not only in this game and the FA Cup Final, and Wilson knew that she would go on to be a superstar. ', 'If you asked me one player who I knew would make it, it was Jordan. There are some aspects of the game that you can train into people but there are some aspects of the game that are just within certain players, and that ability to read the game and that football intelligence is something that the likes of Jordan, Lucy [Bronze] and Lucy Stan[isforth], they had that already built in them, it was then just about making sure that they met the potential that was already there.  ', 'It took us another four years to get into the WSL, only for that dream to be ruined by yet another abandonment. Yet the dream of top having two-flight sides at Sunderland AFC is still there, it should be the driving ambition of the whole operation - it is rightly the expectation of many Lasses fans.', '', '', '', 'Check your inbox for a welcome email.', 'Oops.

', 'I was at the National Football Museum in Manchester a few weeks ago, and before my lad and I queued up for the video penalty shootout challenge (for the record, I was roundly beaten by a jubilant 12-year-old), we played the “You Are The Referee” game, based on the long-running feature in the Guardian newspaper.', 'I was on much stronger ground with this non-physical activity. 30-odd years of watching as much footy as I can fit in added to a bookish childhood spent poring over the copy of the laws of the game found in an FA pocket diary, mean that I like to think that I’m pretty au fait with even the more obscure rules under which the world’s most popular team sport has been built.', 'One of the questions in this quiz related to a famous incident - the beach ball incident against Liverpool at the Stadium of Light. I duly demonstrated my superior knowledge - of course, the goal never should have stood, but oh how we laughed... Sunderland had really had got away with one there! ', \"We sometimes forget the ref, Mike Jones, was demoted to the Championship as a punishment for the mistake. It was a genuine mistake, a human error, something that shouldn't have happened but something that has gone down in the folklore of Sunderland AFC and the Premier League more generally. Jones might never be able to live it down, but we wouldn't have changed it for the world. \", '\\n    Related\\n  ', 'Then, just before my lad’s Under 13s game against his side’s local rivals this Saturday on a frosty 4G surface in my village, I was summonsed by one of the coaches. My heart sank as he opened his mouth, for I knew what was coming... would I be able to ref the game? ', 'Of course, I agreed. There were 20 boys and girls in their smart new kits, plus countless parents, brothers and sisters on the sidelines who’d dragged themselves out of bed on a cold November morning for this game. ', 'There was no way that my reluctance to run up and down the pitch for 70 minutes, whistleless, cardless, making honest but sketchy calls on offsides, free kicks, and penalties (I gave two penalties - one to each side - both disputed) - decisions that would likely colour the rest of these youngsters’ weekends - was going to be enough to stop me from agreeing. I was absolutely knackered afterwards, you can’t stop and you really have to concentrate. ', 'That there was no actually trained, qualified, and equipped official at the game was hardly a rarity - there will be people reading this who ref their kids’ games regularly and probably do a much better job than I did - but I can say that when there is a proper referee it makes a hell of a difference to the experience for everyone. ', 'They’re able to talk players through the match, ensure everyone is clear about why decisions have been given, and take up the right positions on the field, so they can make decisions -  or at the very least not find themselves in the line of a throw-in. ', 'We also know that there’s a horrible tendency, thankfully one I didn’t have to endure this weekend, for those who do put themselves forward to officiate at youth football and the adult grassroots game to be verbally abused and even physically assaulted for having the temerity to facilitate the application of the rules of the game as they see it. ', 'Indeed, I assume it is more likely for a “proper” neutral ref to face abuse and intimidation, a stand-in parent is less likely to face overly competitive coaches, know-it-all parents or hormonal, immature kids getting in their faces and threatening them than someone wearing a full black kit with the FA badge who brandished a red card to little Jimmy or Jenny for denying a goalscoring opportunity. ', 'What has this got to do with the ever-present concern about the quality of decision-making in the professional game in general and some of the concerns of Sunderland supporters this season in particular? ', 'Well, for a start, the abuse of referees from players and spectators is clearly “learned behaviour”. ', 'It’s obviously cultural, it’s something that is copied and carried down through the tiers and the age groups from the professional ranks. What people see at the top levels - and this goes for adults as well as kids - is copied when they’re in the park or on the school 4G pitch.', 'This is something that happens throughout our game but doesn’t happen in other football codes - particularly in rugby. The question as to why this is the case has been asked many times with a variety of answers, but for me, all roads ultimately lead back to us, the paying fans of professional football clubs watching in the stands or at home on pay TV. ', 'I am part of this culture, at Sunderland men’s and women’s matches or at England internationals I am as likely as anyone reading this to be amongst the thousands vocally disagreeing with the calls I see made by the ref. ', 'But I was brought up with the belief that, over the course of a season, the individual incidents will even themselves out for any given club and that, ultimately, trusting in the impartiality and honesty of referees is really important. It means that the players, coaches, and owners of the club we love have to take ownership of results and that at the end of the season, the table doesn’t lie. ', 'And I rarely leave a game thinking that the reason the Lads or the Lasses haven’t got the result we wanted was because of poor refereeing, even if that obvious penalty for handball that wasn’t given to the women’s side the other week at Blackburn still narks, as does the penalty Jack Clarke didn’t get at Ewood too. ', 'The old maxim that, if you’re relying on an offside call or a spot kick for three points, then you’ve really not done enough to deserve them, still applies for the most part. That’s not to say that there are no major issues with refereeing in English football today. ', 'We’re all very aware of those times when the impartiality of referees has been questioned. It’s not just at the extremes like the Serie A corruption scandals to accusations and suspicions of impropriety at the 2002 World Cup, although it is certainly is still a potential issue when the rewards of taking a bribe are a lot higher than the money on offer.', 'We hear every week in the Premier League claims that the full-time professional referees - the elite - are more likely to side with one of the “Big 6” European Super League scab clubs over their less illustrious challengers. In the EFL Championship, we’ve been on the receiving end of a few well-below-par refereeing decisions this season that, if they had gone the other (the correct) way, would probably have seen us stilling very close to if not inside the playoff places right now. ', 'In the Women’s Championship, we have amateur referees overseeing an increasingly fast-paced, physically demanding, and professional game. These are people - sometimes young women themselves - who have other jobs and commitments and are often travelling long distances to take games for not that much money, and so the mistakes they make need to be set in that context.', 'However, unless there are more referees coming through in grassroots football, which is the lifeblood of our whole game, then the pool of talent from which the elite level officials are drawn will be anaemic. Refs at the top will be left with little competition, with the inability of those who are performing poorly to be replaced with the sharp eyes and minds of the up-and-coming.  ', 'But this begs the question: who would be a ref these days, and how on earth do we bring through future generations of high-ranked officials into the game? ', 'I’ve heard suggestions that the problem is that refereeing attracts officious pernickety characters, those with authoritarian mindsets, the power-hungry or even those with sadomasochistic tendencies. It’s claimed by some that they deserve the dog’s abuse they receive and more, that they’re all “Little Hitlers” who get a kick from ruining matches. My view of the world is not so dark and cynical.', '99 percent of those who take the field to adjudicate games are doing so simply because they love football, they want to be involved in football, and they know that, without their commitment, football would not exist. ', \"The sixth-former who turns up on a weekend or after school to take an under 10s game is unlikely to be a megalomanic, they’re simply the kind of community-minded young person that we’d all want our brothers, sisters, children or grandchildren to be. But it's these kids who are being chased away - sometimes literally - by the arseholes shouting from the sidelines up and down this country.\", 'Yes, at the very top level the refereeing teams are paid and they can concentrate on improving and refining all aspects of their performance so that they can keep up with the unbelievable pace and power of the contemporary game, but this time and these resources are only available to a small minority. All those who do make it as pro-referees have come through the ranks while pursuing other careers - jobs that they’ve chosen to leave in order to reach the peak of football officialdom.', 'Yet we all still see the issues, week in week out. Inconsistency in decision-making is the most consistent concern that we hear from fellow fans, closely followed by a worry that the man or woman in the middle are only interested in their own ego or being the centre of attention, or are on the other hand overawed by the big occasion. ', 'Accusations of actual conscious bias are rare, although the suspicion that some clubs get an easier ride than others has and always will be there. ', 'I don’t have many solutions to the problem of quality in the upper ranks. Some sensibly suggest that we need to find ways to get more former footballers to make the move across the divide and take charge of games, they know how the game needs to be controlled and can communicate from a position of empathy and knowledge with their peers. ', 'But on a practical level this becomes difficult - even in the professional game the money on offer is unlikely to be attractive to all but the most altruistic of former footballers - their own misdemeans and rivalries from their playing careers will haunt them wherever they go. ', 'I am ambivalent when it comes to VAR. Personally, I think it has the potential to work, and when applied correctly can lead to the right decisions being made. But it needs to be refined and improved to get more consistency and with speed, because getting the right decision in a sport where the rewards are counted in the hundreds of millions of pounds is very important. ', 'It’s important because, if people don’t believe in the system, if they think its rigged, if they think it’s unfair, then they will become angrier and angrier, and the vicious circle that leads to 16-year-old referees being attacked in park football will continue to whirl out of control.   ', 'There has been a very welcome decline of blind deference in our society over the past few decades. Questioning officialdom, critical thinking, and demanding fairness and evidence rather than tipping your cap to those who’ve been placed in authority is part of the modern democratic world. Unaccountable and entrenched authority, based on nothing more than tradition and seniority, is almost always a bad thing. ', 'But fairness for all, particularly those without so much money and power, also requires clear and consistently applied rules and impartial arbiters. And we should always be open to learning from others and applying these lessons to our own situations. ', 'So maybe we need to mic up with referees in the Premier League, the WSL and the men’s and women’s Championship, so that those watching on the TV and even in the stands know why a decision has been made. ', 'It’s what happens in rugby, where someone of the diminutive stature of Nigel Owens is able to give a thorough dressing down to two 17 stone props and explain the often perplexing laws of that version of football to the thousands in the grounds and millions watching on the telly at the same time. ', 'Perhaps if we’re able to hear the discussions between the referee and the players, and the on-field ref and the VAR or Fourth Official, then we will all learn a lot more about why a particular rule has been applied (or not applied) to a particular scenario, and some of the more egregious abuse that stems from the top and filters to the bottom will be halted. ', 'Almost all controversy has been removed from cricket by the video referral system, and I think football should become open to allowing coaches or captains to request VAR look at a limited number of incidents during a game once the ball is out of play (the awarding of a corner, for example, or a second yellow card, which currently cannot be examined but which could change the course of a game). A reformed VAR, with more input and explanation, could be transformative to modern football’s often toxic culture. ', 'Sunlight may well be the most effective disinfectant.
