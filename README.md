# Text-Mining-Health

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UKDataServiceOpen/Text-Mining-Health/HEAD

What is text-mining? How can I use this method to extract important information from a large number of documents? What are its applications in the field of health?

If these questions intrigue you then dive into our Text-Mining-Health GitHub repo that has been designed to get you familiar with the main concepts. Text-mining is a data-mining process which transforms unstructured text into a structured format, which enables us to identify meaningful patterns and new insights. In terms of digital health, this method (which involves working with qualitative data) may seem more suited to the social sciences. Whilst there is a lot of truth to this, itâ€™s also exciting to see text-mining applied to extract symptom-related information from online forums, or to anonymise personal medical data. This workshop will explore these applications and then showcase this process with a code demonstration in Python and R.
